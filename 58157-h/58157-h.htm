    <p>
      If you look at a Map of the World, you will see, in the left-hand upper
      corner of the Eastern Hemisphere, two Islands lying in the sea.&nbsp; They
      are England and Scotland, and Ireland.&nbsp; England and Scotland form the
      greater part of these Islands.&nbsp; Ireland is the next in size.&nbsp;
      The little neighbouring islands, which are so small upon the Map as to be
      mere dots, are chiefly little bits of Scotland,&mdash;broken off, I dare
      say, in the course of a great length of time, by the power of the restless
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old days, a long, long while ago, before Our Saviour was born on
      earth and lay asleep in a manger, these Islands were in the same place,
      and the stormy sea roared round them, just as it roars now.&nbsp; But the
      sea was not alive, then, with great ships and brave sailors, sailing to
      and from all parts of the world.&nbsp; It was very lonely.&nbsp; The
      Islands lay solitary, in the great expanse of water.&nbsp; The foaming
      waves dashed against their cliffs, and the bleak winds blew over their
      forests; but the winds and waves brought no adventurers to land upon the
      Islands, and the savage Islanders knew nothing of the rest of the world,
      and the rest of the world knew nothing of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is supposed that the Ph&oelig;nicians, who were an ancient people,
      famous for carrying on trade, came in ships to these Islands, and found
      that they produced tin and lead; both very useful things, as you know, and
      both produced to this very hour upon the sea-coast. The most celebrated
      tin mines in Cornwall are, still, close to the sea.&nbsp; One of them,
      which I have seen, is so close to it that it is hollowed out underneath
      the ocean; and the miners say, that in stormy weather, when they are at
      work down in that deep place, they can hear the noise of the waves
      thundering above their heads.&nbsp; So, the Ph&oelig;nicians, coasting
      about the Islands, would come, without much difficulty, to where the tin
      and lead were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ph&oelig;nicians traded with the Islanders for these metals, and gave
      the Islanders some other useful things in exchange.&nbsp; The Islanders
      were, at first, poor savages, going almost naked, or only dressed in the
      rough skins of beasts, and staining their bodies, as other savages do,
      with coloured earths and the juices of plants.&nbsp; But the Ph&oelig;nicians,
      sailing over to the opposite coasts of France and Belgium, and saying to
      the people there, &lsquo;We have been to those white cliffs across the
      water, which you can see in fine weather, and from that country, which is
      called <span class="smcap">Britain</span>, we bring this tin and lead,&rsquo;
      tempted some of the French and Belgians to come over also.&nbsp; These
      people settled themselves on the south coast of England, which is now
      called Kent; and, although they were a rough people too, they taught the
      savage Britons some useful arts, and improved that part of the Islands.&nbsp;
      It is probable that other people came over from Spain to Ireland, and
      settled there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, by little and little, strangers became mixed with the Islanders, and
      the savage Britons grew into a wild, bold people; almost savage, still,
      especially in the interior of the country away from the sea where the
      foreign settlers seldom went; but hardy, brave, and strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole country was covered with forests, and swamps.&nbsp; The greater
      part of it was very misty and cold.&nbsp; There were no roads, no bridges,
      no streets, no houses that you would think deserving of the name.&nbsp; A
      town was nothing but a collection of straw-covered huts, hidden in a thick
      wood, with a ditch all round, and a low wall, made of mud, or the trunks
      of trees placed one upon another.&nbsp; The people planted little or no
      corn, but lived upon the flesh of their flocks and cattle.&nbsp; They made
      no coins, but used metal rings for money.&nbsp; They were clever in
      basket-work, as savage people often are; and they could make a coarse kind
      of cloth, and some very bad earthenware.&nbsp; But in building fortresses
      they were much more clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made boats of basket-work, covered with the skins of animals, but
      seldom, if ever, ventured far from the shore.&nbsp; They made swords, of
      copper mixed with tin; but, these swords were of an awkward shape, and so
      soft that a heavy blow would bend one.&nbsp; They made light shields,
      short pointed daggers, and spears&mdash;which they jerked back after they
      had thrown them at an enemy, by a long strip of leather fastened to the
      stem.&nbsp; The butt-end was a rattle, to frighten an enemy&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp;
      The ancient Britons, being divided into as many as thirty or forty tribes,
      each commanded by its own little king, were constantly fighting with one
      another, as savage people usually do; and they always fought with these
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very fond of horses.&nbsp; The standard of Kent was the picture
      of a white horse.&nbsp; They could break them in and manage them
      wonderfully well.&nbsp; Indeed, the horses (of which they had an
      abundance, though they were rather small) were so well taught in those
      days, that they can scarcely be said to have improved since; though the
      men are so much wiser.&nbsp; They understood, and obeyed, every word of
      command; and would stand still by themselves, in all the din and noise of
      battle, while their masters went to fight on foot.&nbsp; The Britons could
      not have succeeded in their most remarkable art, without the aid of these
      sensible and trusty animals.&nbsp; The art I mean, is the construction and
      management of war-chariots or cars, for which they have ever been
      celebrated in history.&nbsp; Each of the best sort of these chariots, not
      quite breast high in front, and open at the back, contained one man to
      drive, and two or three others to fight&mdash;all standing up.&nbsp; The
      horses who drew them were so well trained, that they would tear, at full
      gallop, over the most stony ways, and even through the woods; dashing down
      their masters&rsquo; enemies beneath their hoofs, and cutting them to
      pieces with the blades of swords, or scythes, which were fastened to the
      wheels, and stretched out beyond the car on each side, for that cruel
      purpose.&nbsp; In a moment, while at full speed, the horses would stop, at
      the driver&rsquo;s command.&nbsp; The men within would leap out, deal
      blows about them with their swords like hail, leap on the horses, on the
      pole, spring back into the chariots anyhow; and, as soon as they were
      safe, the horses tore away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Britons had a strange and terrible religion, called the Religion of
      the Druids.&nbsp; It seems to have been brought over, in very early times
      indeed, from the opposite country of France, anciently called Gaul, and to
      have mixed up the worship of the Serpent, and of the Sun and Moon, with
      the worship of some of the Heathen Gods and Goddesses.&nbsp; Most of its
      ceremonies were kept secret by the priests, the Druids, who pretended to
      be enchanters, and who carried magicians&rsquo; wands, and wore, each of
      them, about his neck, what he told the ignorant people was a Serpent&rsquo;s
      egg in a golden case.&nbsp; But it is certain that the Druidical
      ceremonies included the sacrifice of human victims, the torture of some
      suspected criminals, and, on particular occasions, even the burning alive,
      in immense wicker cages, of a number of men and animals together.&nbsp;
      The Druid Priests had some kind of veneration for the Oak, and for the
      mistletoe&mdash;the same plant that we hang up in houses at Christmas Time
      now&mdash;when its white berries grew upon the Oak.&nbsp; They met
      together in dark woods, which they called Sacred Groves; and there they
      instructed, in their mysterious arts, young men who came to them as
      pupils, and who sometimes stayed with them as long as twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Druids built great Temples and altars, open to the sky, fragments of
      some of which are yet remaining.&nbsp; Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain, in
      Wiltshire, is the most extraordinary of these.&nbsp; Three curious stones,
      called Kits Coty House, on Bluebell Hill, near Maidstone, in Kent, form
      another.&nbsp; We know, from examination of the great blocks of which such
      buildings are made, that they could not have been raised without the aid
      of some ingenious machines, which are common now, but which the ancient
      Britons certainly did not use in making their own uncomfortable houses.&nbsp;
      I should not wonder if the Druids, and their pupils who stayed with them
      twenty years, knowing more than the rest of the Britons, kept the people
      out of sight while they made these buildings, and then pretended that they
      built them by magic.&nbsp; Perhaps they had a hand in the fortresses too;
      at all events, as they were very powerful, and very much believed in, and
      as they made and executed the laws, and paid no taxes, I don&rsquo;t
      wonder that they liked their trade.&nbsp; And, as they persuaded the
      people the more Druids there were, the better off the people would be, I
      don&rsquo;t wonder that there were a good many of them.&nbsp; But it is
      pleasant to think that there are no Druids, <i>now</i>, who go on in that
      way, and pretend to carry Enchanters&rsquo; Wands and Serpents&rsquo; Eggs&mdash;and
      of course there is nothing of the kind, anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the improved condition of the ancient Britons, fifty-five years
      before the birth of Our Saviour, when the Romans, under their great
      General, Julius C&aelig;sar, were masters of all the rest of the known
      world.&nbsp; Julius C&aelig;sar had then just conquered Gaul; and hearing,
      in Gaul, a good deal about the opposite Island with the white cliffs, and
      about the bravery of the Britons who inhabited it&mdash;some of whom had
      been fetched over to help the Gauls in the war against him&mdash;he
      resolved, as he was so near, to come and conquer Britain next.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Julius C&aelig;sar came sailing over to this Island of ours, with
      eighty vessels and twelve thousand men.&nbsp; And he came from the French
      coast between Calais and Boulogne, &lsquo;because thence was the shortest
      passage into Britain;&rsquo; just for the same reason as our steam-boats
      now take the same track, every day.&nbsp; He expected to conquer Britain
      easily: but it was not such easy work as he supposed&mdash;for the bold
      Britons fought most bravely; and, what with not having his horse-soldiers
      with him (for they had been driven back by a storm), and what with having
      some of his vessels dashed to pieces by a high tide after they were drawn
      ashore, he ran great risk of being totally defeated.&nbsp; However, for
      once that the bold Britons beat him, he beat them twice; though not so
      soundly but that he was very glad to accept their proposals of peace, and
      go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in the spring of the next year, he came back; this time, with eight
      hundred vessels and thirty thousand men.&nbsp; The British tribes chose,
      as their general-in-chief, a Briton, whom the Romans in their Latin
      language called <span class="smcap">Cassivellaunus</span>, but whose
      British name is supposed to have been <span class="smcap">Caswallon</span>.&nbsp;
      A brave general he was, and well he and his soldiers fought the Roman
      army!&nbsp; So well, that whenever in that war the Roman soldiers saw a
      great cloud of dust, and heard the rattle of the rapid British chariots,
      they trembled in their hearts.&nbsp; Besides a number of smaller battles,
      there was a battle fought near Canterbury, in Kent; there was a battle
      fought near Chertsey, in Surrey; there was a battle fought near a marshy
      little town in a wood, the capital of that part of Britain which belonged
      to <span class="smcap">Cassivellaunus</span>, and which was probably near
      what is now Saint Albans, in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; However, brave <span
      class="smcap">Cassivellaunus</span> had the worst of it, on the whole;
      though he and his men always fought like lions.&nbsp; As the other British
      chiefs were jealous of him, and were always quarrelling with him, and with
      one another, he gave up, and proposed peace.&nbsp; Julius C&aelig;sar was
      very glad to grant peace easily, and to go away again with all his
      remaining ships and men.&nbsp; He had expected to find pearls in Britain,
      and he may have found a few for anything I know; but, at all events, he
      found delicious oysters, and I am sure he found tough Britons&mdash;of
      whom, I dare say, he made the same complaint as Napoleon Bonaparte the
      great French General did, eighteen hundred years afterwards, when he said
      they were such unreasonable fellows that they never knew when they were
      beaten.&nbsp; They never <i>did</i> know, I believe, and never will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly a hundred years passed on, and all that time, there was peace in
      Britain.&nbsp; The Britons improved their towns and mode of life: became
      more civilised, travelled, and learnt a great deal from the Gauls and
      Romans.&nbsp; At last, the Roman Emperor, Claudius, sent <span
      class="smcap">Aulus Plautius</span>, a skilful general, with a mighty
      force, to subdue the Island, and shortly afterwards arrived himself.&nbsp;
      They did little; and <span class="smcap">Ostorius Scapula</span>, another
      general, came.&nbsp; Some of the British Chiefs of Tribes submitted.&nbsp;
      Others resolved to fight to the death.&nbsp; Of these brave men, the
      bravest was <span class="smcap">Caractacus</span>, or <span class="smcap">Caradoc</span>,
      who gave battle to the Romans, with his army, among the mountains of North
      Wales.&nbsp; &lsquo;This day,&rsquo; said he to his soldiers, &lsquo;decides
      the fate of Britain!&nbsp; Your liberty, or your eternal slavery, dates
      from this hour.&nbsp; Remember your brave ancestors, who drove the great C&aelig;sar
      himself across the sea!&rsquo;&nbsp; On hearing these words, his men, with
      a great shout, rushed upon the Romans.&nbsp; But the strong Roman swords
      and armour were too much for the weaker British weapons in close conflict.&nbsp;
      The Britons lost the day.&nbsp; The wife and daughter of the brave <span
      class="smcap">Caractacus</span> were taken prisoners; his brothers
      delivered themselves up; he himself was betrayed into the hands of the
      Romans by his false and base stepmother: and they carried him, and all his
      family, in triumph to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a great man will be great in misfortune, great in prison, great in
      chains.&nbsp; His noble air, and dignified endurance of distress, so
      touched the Roman people who thronged the streets to see him, that he and
      his family were restored to freedom.&nbsp; No one knows whether his great
      heart broke, and he died in Rome, or whether he ever returned to his own
      dear country.&nbsp; English oaks have grown up from acorns, and withered
      away, when they were hundreds of years old&mdash;and other oaks have
      sprung up in their places, and died too, very aged&mdash;since the rest of
      the history of the brave <span class="smcap">Caractacus</span> was
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the Britons <i>would not</i> yield.&nbsp; They rose again and
      again, and died by thousands, sword in hand.&nbsp; They rose, on every
      possible occasion.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Suetonius</span>, another
      Roman general, came, and stormed the Island of Anglesey (then called <span
      class="smcap">Mona</span>), which was supposed to be sacred, and he burnt
      the Druids in their own wicker cages, by their own fires.&nbsp; But, even
      while he was in Britain, with his victorious troops, the <span
      class="smcap">Britons</span> rose.&nbsp; Because <span class="smcap">Boadicea</span>,
      a British queen, the widow of the King of the Norfolk and Suffolk people,
      resisted the plundering of her property by the Romans who were settled in
      England, she was scourged, by order of <span class="smcap">Catus</span> a
      Roman officer; and her two daughters were shamefully insulted in her
      presence, and her husband&rsquo;s relations were made slaves.&nbsp; To
      avenge this injury, the Britons rose, with all their might and rage.&nbsp;
      They drove <span class="smcap">Catus</span> into Gaul; they laid the Roman
      possessions waste; they forced the Romans out of London, then a poor
      little town, but a trading place; they hanged, burnt, crucified, and slew
      by the sword, seventy thousand Romans in a few days.&nbsp; <span
      class="smcap">Suetonius</span> strengthened his army, and advanced to give
      them battle.&nbsp; They strengthened their army, and desperately attacked
      his, on the field where it was strongly posted.&nbsp; Before the first
      charge of the Britons was made, <span class="smcap">Boadicea</span>, in a
      war-chariot, with her fair hair streaming in the wind, and her injured
      daughters lying at her feet, drove among the troops, and cried to them for
      vengeance on their oppressors, the licentious Romans.&nbsp; The Britons
      fought to the last; but they were vanquished with great slaughter, and the
      unhappy queen took poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the spirit of the Britons was not broken.&nbsp; When <span
      class="smcap">Suetonius</span> left the country, they fell upon his
      troops, and retook the Island of Anglesey.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Agricola</span>
      came, fifteen or twenty years afterwards, and retook it once more, and
      devoted seven years to subduing the country, especially that part of it
      which is now called <span class="smcap">Scotland</span>; but, its people,
      the Caledonians, resisted him at every inch of ground.&nbsp; They fought
      the bloodiest battles with him; they killed their very wives and children,
      to prevent his making prisoners of them; they fell, fighting, in such
      great numbers that certain hills in Scotland are yet supposed to be vast
      heaps of stones piled up above their graves.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Hadrian</span>
      came, thirty years afterwards, and still they resisted him.&nbsp; <span
      class="smcap">Severus</span> came, nearly a hundred years afterwards, and
      they worried his great army like dogs, and rejoiced to see them die, by
      thousands, in the bogs and swamps.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Caracalla</span>,
      the son and successor of <span class="smcap">Severus</span>, did the most
      to conquer them, for a time; but not by force of arms.&nbsp; He knew how
      little that would do.&nbsp; He yielded up a quantity of land to the
      Caledonians, and gave the Britons the same privileges as the Romans
      possessed.&nbsp; There was peace, after this, for seventy years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then new enemies arose.&nbsp; They were the Saxons, a fierce, sea-faring
      people from the countries to the North of the Rhine, the great river of
      Germany on the banks of which the best grapes grow to make the German
      wine.&nbsp; They began to come, in pirate ships, to the sea-coast of Gaul
      and Britain, and to plunder them.&nbsp; They were repulsed by <span
      class="smcap">Carausius</span>, a native either of Belgium or of Britain,
      who was appointed by the Romans to the command, and under whom the Britons
      first began to fight upon the sea.&nbsp; But, after this time, they
      renewed their ravages.&nbsp; A few years more, and the Scots (which was
      then the name for the people of Ireland), and the Picts, a northern
      people, began to make frequent plundering incursions into the South of
      Britain.&nbsp; All these attacks were repeated, at intervals, during two
      hundred years, and through a long succession of Roman Emperors and chiefs;
      during all which length of time, the Britons rose against the Romans, over
      and over again.&nbsp; At last, in the days of the Roman <span class="smcap">Honorius</span>,
      when the Roman power all over the world was fast declining, and when Rome
      wanted all her soldiers at home, the Romans abandoned all hope of
      conquering Britain, and went away.&nbsp; And still, at last, as at first,
      the Britons rose against them, in their old brave manner; for, a very
      little while before, they had turned away the Roman magistrates, and
      declared themselves an independent people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five hundred years had passed, since Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s first
      invasion of the Island, when the Romans departed from it for ever.&nbsp;
      In the course of that time, although they had been the cause of terrible
      fighting and bloodshed, they had done much to improve the condition of the
      Britons.&nbsp; They had made great military roads; they had built forts;
      they had taught them how to dress, and arm themselves, much better than
      they had ever known how to do before; they had refined the whole British
      way of living.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Agricola</span> had built a great
      wall of earth, more than seventy miles long, extending from Newcastle to
      beyond Carlisle, for the purpose of keeping out the Picts and Scots; <span
      class="smcap">Hadrian</span> had strengthened it; <span class="smcap">Severus</span>,
      finding it much in want of repair, had built it afresh of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, it was in the Roman time, and by means of Roman ships, that the
      Christian Religion was first brought into Britain, and its people first
      taught the great lesson that, to be good in the sight of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, they must love their neighbours as themselves,
      and do unto others as they would be done by.&nbsp; The Druids declared
      that it was very wicked to believe in any such thing, and cursed all the
      people who did believe it, very heartily.&nbsp; But, when the people found
      that they were none the better for the blessings of the Druids, and none
      the worse for the curses of the Druids, but, that the sun shone and the
      rain fell without consulting the Druids at all, they just began to think
      that the Druids were mere men, and that it signified very little whether
      they cursed or blessed.&nbsp; After which, the pupils of the Druids fell
      off greatly in numbers, and the Druids took to other trades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I have come to the end of the Roman time in England.&nbsp; It is but
      little that is known of those five hundred years; but some remains of them
      are still found.&nbsp; Often, when labourers are digging up the ground, to
      make foundations for houses or churches, they light on rusty money that
      once belonged to the Romans.&nbsp; Fragments of plates from which they
      ate, of goblets from which they drank, and of pavement on which they trod,
      are discovered among the earth that is broken by the plough, or the dust
      that is crumbled by the gardener&rsquo;s spade.&nbsp; Wells that the
      Romans sunk, still yield water; roads that the Romans made, form part of
      our highways.&nbsp; In some old battle-fields, British spear-heads and
      Roman armour have been found, mingled together in decay, as they fell in
      the thick pressure of the fight.&nbsp; Traces of Roman camps overgrown
      with grass, and of mounds that are the burial-places of heaps of Britons,
      are to be seen in almost all parts of the country.&nbsp; Across the bleak
      moors of Northumberland, the wall of <span class="smcap">Severus</span>,
      overrun with moss and weeds, still stretches, a strong ruin; and the
      shepherds and their dogs lie sleeping on it in the summer weather.&nbsp;
      On Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge yet stands: a monument of the earlier time
      when the Roman name was unknown in Britain, and when the Druids, with
      their best magic wands, could not have written it in the sands of the wild
      sea-shore.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;ANCIENT ENGLAND UNDER THE EARLY SAXONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Romans had scarcely gone away from Britain, when the Britons began to
      wish they had never left it.&nbsp; For, the Romans being gone, and the
      Britons being much reduced in numbers by their long wars, the Picts and
      Scots came pouring in, over the broken and unguarded wall of <span
      class="smcap">Severus</span>, in swarms.&nbsp; They plundered the richest
      towns, and killed the people; and came back so often for more booty and
      more slaughter, that the unfortunate Britons lived a life of terror.&nbsp;
      As if the Picts and Scots were not bad enough on land, the Saxons attacked
      the islanders by sea; and, as if something more were still wanting to make
      them miserable, they quarrelled bitterly among themselves as to what
      prayers they ought to say, and how they ought to say them.&nbsp; The
      priests, being very angry with one another on these questions, cursed one
      another in the heartiest manner; and (uncommonly like the old Druids)
      cursed all the people whom they could not persuade.&nbsp; So, altogether,
      the Britons were very badly off, you may believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in such distress, in short, that they sent a letter to Rome
      entreating help&mdash;which they called the Groans of the Britons; and in
      which they said, &lsquo;The barbarians chase us into the sea, the sea
      throws us back upon the barbarians, and we have only the hard choice left
      us of perishing by the sword, or perishing by the waves.&rsquo;&nbsp; But,
      the Romans could not help them, even if they were so inclined; for they
      had enough to do to defend themselves against their own enemies, who were
      then very fierce and strong.&nbsp; At last, the Britons, unable to bear
      their hard condition any longer, resolved to make peace with the Saxons,
      and to invite the Saxons to come into their country, and help them to keep
      out the Picts and Scots.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a British Prince named <span class="smcap">Vortigern</span> who
      took this resolution, and who made a treaty of friendship with <span
      class="smcap">Hengist</span> and <span class="smcap">Horsa</span>, two
      Saxon chiefs.&nbsp; Both of these names, in the old Saxon language,
      signify Horse; for the Saxons, like many other nations in a rough state,
      were fond of giving men the names of animals, as Horse, Wolf, Bear, Hound.&nbsp;
      The Indians of North America,&mdash;a very inferior people to the Saxons,
      though&mdash;do the same to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Hengist</span> and <span class="smcap">Horsa</span>
      drove out the Picts and Scots; and <span class="smcap">Vortigern</span>,
      being grateful to them for that service, made no opposition to their
      settling themselves in that part of England which is called the Isle of
      Thanet, or to their inviting over more of their countrymen to join them.&nbsp;
      But <span class="smcap">Hengist</span> had a beautiful daughter named
      <span class="smcap">Rowena</span>; and when, at a feast, she filled a
      golden goblet to the brim with wine, and gave it to <span class="smcap">Vortigern</span>,
      saying in a sweet voice, &lsquo;Dear King, thy health!&rsquo; the King
      fell in love with her.&nbsp; My opinion is, that the cunning <span
      class="smcap">Hengist</span> meant him to do so, in order that the Saxons
      might have greater influence with him; and that the fair <span
      class="smcap">Rowena</span> came to that feast, golden goblet and all, on
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, they were married; and, long afterwards, whenever the King
      was angry with the Saxons, or jealous of their encroachments, <span
      class="smcap">Rowena</span> would put her beautiful arms round his neck,
      and softly say, &lsquo;Dear King, they are my people!&nbsp; Be favourable
      to them, as you loved that Saxon girl who gave you the golden goblet of
      wine at the feast!&rsquo;&nbsp; And, really, I don&rsquo;t see how the
      King could help himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah!&nbsp; We must all die!&nbsp; In the course of years, <span
      class="smcap">Vortigern</span> died&mdash;he was dethroned, and put in
      prison, first, I am afraid; and <span class="smcap">Rowena</span> died;
      and generations of Saxons and Britons died; and events that happened
      during a long, long time, would have been quite forgotten but for the
      tales and songs of the old Bards, who used to go about from feast to
      feast, with their white beards, recounting the deeds of their forefathers.&nbsp;
      Among the histories of which they sang and talked, there was a famous one,
      concerning the bravery and virtues of <span class="smcap">King Arthur</span>,
      supposed to have been a British Prince in those old times.&nbsp; But,
      whether such a person really lived, or whether there were several persons
      whose histories came to be confused together under that one name, or
      whether all about him was invention, no one knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will tell you, shortly, what is most interesting in the early Saxon
      times, as they are described in these songs and stories of the Bards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In, and long after, the days of <span class="smcap">Vortigern</span>,
      fresh bodies of Saxons, under various chiefs, came pouring into Britain.&nbsp;
      One body, conquering the Britons in the East, and settling there, called
      their kingdom Essex; another body settled in the West, and called their
      kingdom Wessex; the Northfolk, or Norfolk people, established themselves
      in one place; the Southfolk, or Suffolk people, established themselves in
      another; and gradually seven kingdoms or states arose in England, which
      were called the Saxon Heptarchy.&nbsp; The poor Britons, falling back
      before these crowds of fighting men whom they had innocently invited over
      as friends, retired into Wales and the adjacent country; into Devonshire,
      and into Cornwall.&nbsp; Those parts of England long remained unconquered.&nbsp;
      And in Cornwall now&mdash;where the sea-coast is very gloomy, steep, and
      rugged&mdash;where, in the dark winter-time, ships have often been wrecked
      close to the land, and every soul on board has perished&mdash;where the
      winds and waves howl drearily and split the solid rocks into arches and
      caverns&mdash;there are very ancient ruins, which the people call the
      ruins of <span class="smcap">King Arthur&rsquo;s</span> Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent is the most famous of the seven Saxon kingdoms, because the Christian
      religion was preached to the Saxons there (who domineered over the Britons
      too much, to care for what <i>they</i> said about their religion, or
      anything else) by <span class="smcap">Augustine</span>, a monk from Rome.&nbsp;
      <span class="smcap">King Ethelbert</span>, of Kent, was soon converted;
      and the moment he said he was a Christian, his courtiers all said <i>they</i>
      were Christians; after which, ten thousand of his subjects said they were
      Christians too.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> built a little
      church, close to this King&rsquo;s palace, on the ground now occupied by
      the beautiful cathedral of Canterbury.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Sebert</span>,
      the King&rsquo;s nephew, built on a muddy marshy place near London, where
      there had been a temple to Apollo, a church dedicated to Saint Peter,
      which is now Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; And, in London itself, on the
      foundation of a temple to Diana, he built another little church which has
      risen up, since that old time, to be Saint Paul&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of <span class="smcap">Ethelbert</span>, <span
      class="smcap">Edwin</span>, King of Northumbria, who was such a good king
      that it was said a woman or child might openly carry a purse of gold, in
      his reign, without fear, allowed his child to be baptised, and held a
      great council to consider whether he and his people should all be
      Christians or not.&nbsp; It was decided that they should be.&nbsp; <span
      class="smcap">Coifi</span>, the chief priest of the old religion, made a
      great speech on the occasion.&nbsp; In this discourse, he told the people
      that he had found out the old gods to be impostors.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
      quite satisfied of it,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at me!&nbsp; I
      have been serving them all my life, and they have done nothing for me;
      whereas, if they had been really powerful, they could not have decently
      done less, in return for all I have done for them, than make my fortune.&nbsp;
      As they have never made my fortune, I am quite convinced they are
      impostors!&rsquo;&nbsp; When this singular priest had finished speaking,
      he hastily armed himself with sword and lance, mounted a war-horse, rode
      at a furious gallop in sight of all the people to the temple, and flung
      his lance against it as an insult.&nbsp; From that time, the Christian
      religion spread itself among the Saxons, and became their faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next very famous prince was <span class="smcap">Egbert</span>.&nbsp;
      He lived about a hundred and fifty years afterwards, and claimed to have a
      better right to the throne of Wessex than <span class="smcap">Beortric</span>,
      another Saxon prince who was at the head of that kingdom, and who married
      <span class="smcap">Edburga</span>, the daughter of <span class="smcap">Offa</span>,
      king of another of the seven kingdoms.&nbsp; This <span class="smcap">Queen
      Edburga</span> was a handsome murderess, who poisoned people when they
      offended her.&nbsp; One day, she mixed a cup of poison for a certain noble
      belonging to the court; but her husband drank of it too, by mistake, and
      died.&nbsp; Upon this, the people revolted, in great crowds; and running
      to the palace, and thundering at the gates, cried, &lsquo;Down with the
      wicked queen, who poisons men!&rsquo;&nbsp; They drove her out of the
      country, and abolished the title she had disgraced.&nbsp; When years had
      passed away, some travellers came home from Italy, and said that in the
      town of Pavia they had seen a ragged beggar-woman, who had once been
      handsome, but was then shrivelled, bent, and yellow, wandering about the
      streets, crying for bread; and that this beggar-woman was the poisoning
      English queen.&nbsp; It was, indeed, <span class="smcap">Edburga</span>;
      and so she died, without a shelter for her wretched head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Egbert</span>, not considering himself safe in
      England, in consequence of his having claimed the crown of Wessex (for he
      thought his rival might take him prisoner and put him to death), sought
      refuge at the court of <span class="smcap">Charlemagne</span>, King of
      France.&nbsp; On the death of <span class="smcap">Beortric</span>, so
      unhappily poisoned by mistake, <span class="smcap">Egbert</span> came back
      to Britain; succeeded to the throne of Wessex; conquered some of the other
      monarchs of the seven kingdoms; added their territories to his own; and,
      for the first time, called the country over which he ruled, <span
      class="smcap">England</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, new enemies arose, who, for a long time, troubled England sorely.&nbsp;
      These were the Northmen, the people of Denmark and Norway, whom the
      English called the Danes.&nbsp; They were a warlike people, quite at home
      upon the sea; not Christians; very daring and cruel.&nbsp; They came over
      in ships, and plundered and burned wheresoever they landed.&nbsp; Once,
      they beat <span class="smcap">Egbert</span> in battle.&nbsp; Once, <span
      class="smcap">Egbert</span> beat them.&nbsp; But, they cared no more for
      being beaten than the English themselves.&nbsp; In the four following
      short reigns, of <span class="smcap">Ethelwulf</span>, and his sons, <span
      class="smcap">Ethelbald</span>, <span class="smcap">Ethelbert</span>, and
      <span class="smcap">Ethelred</span>, they came back, over and over again,
      burning and plundering, and laying England waste.&nbsp; In the
      last-mentioned reign, they seized <span class="smcap">Edmund</span>, King
      of East England, and bound him to a tree.&nbsp; Then, they proposed to him
      that he should change his religion; but he, being a good Christian,
      steadily refused.&nbsp; Upon that, they beat him, made cowardly jests upon
      him, all defenceless as he was, shot arrows at him, and, finally, struck
      off his head.&nbsp; It is impossible to say whose head they might have
      struck off next, but for the death of <span class="smcap">King Ethelred</span>
      from a wound he had received in fighting against them, and the succession
      to his throne of the best and wisest king that ever lived in England.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER THE GOOD SAXON, ALFRED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alfred the Great was a young man, three-and-twenty years of age, when he
      became king.&nbsp; Twice in his childhood, he had been taken to Rome,
      where the Saxon nobles were in the habit of going on journeys which they
      supposed to be religious; and, once, he had stayed for some time in Paris.&nbsp;
      Learning, however, was so little cared for, then, that at twelve years old
      he had not been taught to read; although, of the sons of <span
      class="smcap">King Ethelwulf</span>, he, the youngest, was the favourite.&nbsp;
      But he had&mdash;as most men who grow up to be great and good are
      generally found to have had&mdash;an excellent mother; and, one day, this
      lady, whose name was <span class="smcap">Osburga</span>, happened, as she
      was sitting among her sons, to read a book of Saxon poetry.&nbsp; The art
      of printing was not known until long and long after that period, and the
      book, which was written, was what is called &lsquo;illuminated,&rsquo;
      with beautiful bright letters, richly painted.&nbsp; The brothers admiring
      it very much, their mother said, &lsquo;I will give it to that one of you
      four princes who first learns to read.&rsquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>
      sought out a tutor that very day, applied himself to learn with great
      diligence, and soon won the book.&nbsp; He was proud of it, all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine battles with
      the Danes.&nbsp; He made some treaties with them too, by which the false
      Danes swore they would quit the country.&nbsp; They pretended to consider
      that they had taken a very solemn oath, in swearing this upon the holy
      bracelets that they wore, and which were always buried with them when they
      died; but they cared little for it, for they thought nothing of breaking
      oaths and treaties too, as soon as it suited their purpose, and coming
      back again to fight, plunder, and burn, as usual.&nbsp; One fatal winter,
      in the fourth year of <span class="smcap">King Alfred&rsquo;s</span>
      reign, they spread themselves in great numbers over the whole of England;
      and so dispersed and routed the King&rsquo;s soldiers that the King was
      left alone, and was obliged to disguise himself as a common peasant, and
      to take refuge in the cottage of one of his cowherds who did not know his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, <span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, while the Danes sought him
      far and near, was left alone one day, by the cowherd&rsquo;s wife, to
      watch some cakes which she put to bake upon the hearth.&nbsp; But, being
      at work upon his bow and arrows, with which he hoped to punish the false
      Danes when a brighter time should come, and thinking deeply of his poor
      unhappy subjects whom the Danes chased through the land, his noble mind
      forgot the cakes, and they were burnt.&nbsp; &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said the
      cowherd&rsquo;s wife, who scolded him well when she came back, and little
      thought she was scolding the King, &lsquo;you will be ready enough to eat
      them by-and-by, and yet you cannot watch them, idle dog?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, the Devonshire men made head against a new host of Danes who
      landed on their coast; killed their chief, and captured their flag; on
      which was represented the likeness of a Raven&mdash;a very fit bird for a
      thievish army like that, I think.&nbsp; The loss of their standard
      troubled the Danes greatly, for they believed it to be enchanted&mdash;woven
      by the three daughters of one father in a single afternoon&mdash;and they
      had a story among themselves that when they were victorious in battle, the
      Raven stretched his wings and seemed to fly; and that when they were
      defeated, he would droop.&nbsp; He had good reason to droop, now, if he
      could have done anything half so sensible; for, <span class="smcap">King
      Alfred</span> joined the Devonshire men; made a camp with them on a piece
      of firm ground in the midst of a bog in Somersetshire; and prepared for a
      great attempt for vengeance on the Danes, and the deliverance of his
      oppressed people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, first, as it was important to know how numerous those pestilent Danes
      were, and how they were fortified, <span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>,
      being a good musician, disguised himself as a glee-man or minstrel, and
      went, with his harp, to the Danish camp.&nbsp; He played and sang in the
      very tent of <span class="smcap">Guthrum</span> the Danish leader, and
      entertained the Danes as they caroused.&nbsp; While he seemed to think of
      nothing but his music, he was watchful of their tents, their arms, their
      discipline, everything that he desired to know.&nbsp; And right soon did
      this great king entertain them to a different tune; for, summoning all his
      true followers to meet him at an appointed place, where they received him
      with joyful shouts and tears, as the monarch whom many of them had given
      up for lost or dead, he put himself at their head, marched on the Danish
      camp, defeated the Danes with great slaughter, and besieged them for
      fourteen days to prevent their escape.&nbsp; But, being as merciful as he
      was good and brave, he then, instead of killing them, proposed peace: on
      condition that they should altogether depart from that Western part of
      England, and settle in the East; and that <span class="smcap">Guthrum</span>
      should become a Christian, in remembrance of the Divine religion which now
      taught his conqueror, the noble <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, to
      forgive the enemy who had so often injured him.&nbsp; This, <span
      class="smcap">Guthrum</span> did.&nbsp; At his baptism, <span class="smcap">King
      Alfred</span> was his godfather.&nbsp; And <span class="smcap">Guthrum</span>
      was an honourable chief who well deserved that clemency; for, ever
      afterwards he was loyal and faithful to the king.&nbsp; The Danes under
      him were faithful too.&nbsp; They plundered and burned no more, but worked
      like honest men.&nbsp; They ploughed, and sowed, and reaped, and led good
      honest English lives.&nbsp; And I hope the children of those Danes played,
      many a time, with Saxon children in the sunny fields; and that Danish
      young men fell in love with Saxon girls, and married them; and that
      English travellers, benighted at the doors of Danish cottages, often went
      in for shelter until morning; and that Danes and Saxons sat by the red
      fire, friends, talking of <span class="smcap">King Alfred the Great</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Danes were not like these under <span class="smcap">Guthrum</span>;
      for, after some years, more of them came over, in the old plundering and
      burning way&mdash;among them a fierce pirate of the name of <span
      class="smcap">Hastings</span>, who had the boldness to sail up the Thames
      to Gravesend, with eighty ships.&nbsp; For three years, there was a war
      with these Danes; and there was a famine in the country, too, and a
      plague, both upon human creatures and beasts.&nbsp; But <span class="smcap">King
      Alfred</span>, whose mighty heart never failed him, built large ships
      nevertheless, with which to pursue the pirates on the sea; and he
      encouraged his soldiers, by his brave example, to fight valiantly against
      them on the shore.&nbsp; At last, he drove them all away; and then there
      was repose in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      As great and good in peace, as he was great and good in war, <span
      class="smcap">King Alfred</span> never rested from his labours to improve
      his people.&nbsp; He loved to talk with clever men, and with travellers
      from foreign countries, and to write down what they told him, for his
      people to read.&nbsp; He had studied Latin after learning to read English,
      and now another of his labours was, to translate Latin books into the
      English-Saxon tongue, that his people might be interested, and improved by
      their contents.&nbsp; He made just laws, that they might live more happily
      and freely; he turned away all partial judges, that no wrong might be done
      them; he was so careful of their property, and punished robbers so
      severely, that it was a common thing to say that under the great <span
      class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, garlands of golden chains and jewels
      might have hung across the streets, and no man would have touched one.&nbsp;
      He founded schools; he patiently heard causes himself in his Court of
      Justice; the great desires of his heart were, to do right to all his
      subjects, and to leave England better, wiser, happier in all ways, than he
      found it.&nbsp; His industry in these efforts was quite astonishing.&nbsp;
      Every day he divided into certain portions, and in each portion devoted
      himself to a certain pursuit.&nbsp; That he might divide his time exactly,
      he had wax torches or candles made, which were all of the same size, were
      notched across at regular distances, and were always kept burning.&nbsp;
      Thus, as the candles burnt down, he divided the day into notches, almost
      as accurately as we now divide it into hours upon the clock.&nbsp; But
      when the candles were first invented, it was found that the wind and
      draughts of air, blowing into the palace through the doors and windows,
      and through the chinks in the walls, caused them to gutter and burn
      unequally.&nbsp; To prevent this, the King had them put into cases formed
      of wood and white horn.&nbsp; And these were the first lanthorns ever made
      in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, he was afflicted with a terrible unknown disease, which
      caused him violent and frequent pain that nothing could relieve.&nbsp; He
      bore it, as he had borne all the troubles of his life, like a brave good
      man, until he was fifty-three years old; and then, having reigned thirty
      years, he died.&nbsp; He died in the year nine hundred and one; but, long
      ago as that is, his fame, and the love and gratitude with which his
      subjects regarded him, are freshly remembered to the present hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next reign, which was the reign of <span class="smcap">Edward</span>,
      surnamed <span class="smcap">The Elder</span>, who was chosen in council
      to succeed, a nephew of <span class="smcap">King Alfred</span> troubled
      the country by trying to obtain the throne.&nbsp; The Danes in the East of
      England took part with this usurper (perhaps because they had honoured his
      uncle so much, and honoured him for his uncle&rsquo;s sake), and there was
      hard fighting; but, the King, with the assistance of his sister, gained
      the day, and reigned in peace for four and twenty years.&nbsp; He
      gradually extended his power over the whole of England, and so the Seven
      Kingdoms were united into one.
    </p>
    <p>
      When England thus became one kingdom, ruled over by one Saxon king, the
      Saxons had been settled in the country more than four hundred and fifty
      years.&nbsp; Great changes had taken place in its customs during that
      time.&nbsp; The Saxons were still greedy eaters and great drinkers, and
      their feasts were often of a noisy and drunken kind; but many new comforts
      and even elegances had become known, and were fast increasing.&nbsp;
      Hangings for the walls of rooms, where, in these modern days, we paste up
      paper, are known to have been sometimes made of silk, ornamented with
      birds and flowers in needlework.&nbsp; Tables and chairs were curiously
      carved in different woods; were sometimes decorated with gold or silver;
      sometimes even made of those precious metals.&nbsp; Knives and spoons were
      used at table; golden ornaments were worn&mdash;with silk and cloth, and
      golden tissues and embroideries; dishes were made of gold and silver,
      brass and bone.&nbsp; There were varieties of drinking-horns, bedsteads,
      musical instruments.&nbsp; A harp was passed round, at a feast, like the
      drinking-bowl, from guest to guest; and each one usually sang or played
      when his turn came.&nbsp; The weapons of the Saxons were stoutly made, and
      among them was a terrible iron hammer that gave deadly blows, and was long
      remembered.&nbsp; The Saxons themselves were a handsome people.&nbsp; The
      men were proud of their long fair hair, parted on the forehead; their
      ample beards, their fresh complexions, and clear eyes.&nbsp; The beauty of
      the Saxon women filled all England with a new delight and grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have more to tell of the Saxons yet, but I stop to say this now, because
      under the <span class="smcap">Great Alfred</span>, all the best points of
      the English-Saxon character were first encouraged, and in him first shown.&nbsp;
      It has been the greatest character among the nations of the earth.&nbsp;
      Wherever the descendants of the Saxon race have gone, have sailed, or
      otherwise made their way, even to the remotest regions of the world, they
      have been patient, persevering, never to be broken in spirit, never to be
      turned aside from enterprises on which they have resolved.&nbsp; In
      Europe, Asia, Africa, America, the whole world over; in the desert, in the
      forest, on the sea; scorched by a burning sun, or frozen by ice that never
      melts; the Saxon blood remains unchanged.&nbsp; Wheresoever that race
      goes, there, law, and industry, and safety for life and property, and all
      the great results of steady perseverance, are certain to arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pause to think with admiration, of the noble king who, in his single
      person, possessed all the Saxon virtues.&nbsp; Whom misfortune could not
      subdue, whom prosperity could not spoil, whose perseverance nothing could
      shake.&nbsp; Who was hopeful in defeat, and generous in success.&nbsp; Who
      loved justice, freedom, truth, and knowledge.&nbsp; Who, in his care to
      instruct his people, probably did more to preserve the beautiful old Saxon
      language, than I can imagine.&nbsp; Without whom, the English tongue in
      which I tell this story might have wanted half its meaning.&nbsp; As it is
      said that his spirit still inspires some of our best English laws, so, let
      you and I pray that it may animate our English hearts, at least to this&mdash;to
      resolve, when we see any of our fellow-creatures left in ignorance, that
      we will do our best, while life is in us, to have them taught; and to tell
      those rulers whose duty it is to teach them, and who neglect their duty,
      that they have profited very little by all the years that have rolled away
      since the year nine hundred and one, and that they are far behind the
      bright example of <span class="smcap">King Alfred the Great</span>.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER ATHELSTAN AND THE SIX BOY-KINGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Athelstan, the son of Edward the Elder, succeeded that king.&nbsp; He
      reigned only fifteen years; but he remembered the glory of his
      grandfather, the great Alfred, and governed England well.&nbsp; He reduced
      the turbulent people of Wales, and obliged them to pay him a tribute in
      money, and in cattle, and to send him their best hawks and hounds.&nbsp;
      He was victorious over the Cornish men, who were not yet quite under the
      Saxon government.&nbsp; He restored such of the old laws as were good, and
      had fallen into disuse; made some wise new laws, and took care of the poor
      and weak.&nbsp; A strong alliance, made against him by <span class="smcap">Anlaf</span>
      a Danish prince, <span class="smcap">Constantine</span> King of the Scots,
      and the people of North Wales, he broke and defeated in one great battle,
      long famous for the vast numbers slain in it.&nbsp; After that, he had a
      quiet reign; the lords and ladies about him had leisure to become polite
      and agreeable; and foreign princes were glad (as they have sometimes been
      since) to come to England on visits to the English court.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Athelstan died, at forty-seven years old, his brother <span
      class="smcap">Edmund</span>, who was only eighteen, became king.&nbsp; He
      was the first of six boy-kings, as you will presently know.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called him the Magnificent, because he showed a taste for improvement
      and refinement.&nbsp; But he was beset by the Danes, and had a short and
      troubled reign, which came to a troubled end.&nbsp; One night, when he was
      feasting in his hall, and had eaten much and drunk deep, he saw, among the
      company, a noted robber named <span class="smcap">Leof</span>, who had
      been banished from England.&nbsp; Made very angry by the boldness of this
      man, the King turned to his cup-bearer, and said, &lsquo;There is a robber
      sitting at the table yonder, who, for his crimes, is an outlaw in the land&mdash;a
      hunted wolf, whose life any man may take, at any time.&nbsp; Command that
      robber to depart!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I will not depart!&rsquo; said Leof.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;No?&rsquo; cried the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, by the Lord!&rsquo;
      said Leof.&nbsp; Upon that the King rose from his seat, and, making
      passionately at the robber, and seizing him by his long hair, tried to
      throw him down.&nbsp; But the robber had a dagger underneath his cloak,
      and, in the scuffle, stabbed the King to death.&nbsp; That done, he set
      his back against the wall, and fought so desperately, that although he was
      soon cut to pieces by the King&rsquo;s armed men, and the wall and
      pavement were splashed with his blood, yet it was not before he had killed
      and wounded many of them.&nbsp; You may imagine what rough lives the kings
      of those times led, when one of them could struggle, half drunk, with a
      public robber in his own dining-hall, and be stabbed in presence of the
      company who ate and drank with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then succeeded the boy-king <span class="smcap">Edred</span>, who was weak
      and sickly in body, but of a strong mind.&nbsp; And his armies fought the
      Northmen, the Danes, and Norwegians, or the Sea-Kings, as they were
      called, and beat them for the time.&nbsp; And, in nine years, Edred died,
      and passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the boy-king <span class="smcap">Edwy</span>, fifteen years of
      age; but the real king, who had the real power, was a monk named <span
      class="smcap">Dunstan</span>&mdash;a clever priest, a little mad, and not
      a little proud and cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dunstan was then Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, whither the body of King
      Edmund the Magnificent was carried, to be buried.&nbsp; While yet a boy,
      he had got out of his bed one night (being then in a fever), and walked
      about Glastonbury Church when it was under repair; and, because he did not
      tumble off some scaffolds that were there, and break his neck, it was
      reported that he had been shown over the building by an angel.&nbsp; He
      had also made a harp that was said to play of itself&mdash;which it very
      likely did, as &AElig;olian Harps, which are played by the wind, and are
      understood now, always do.&nbsp; For these wonders he had been once
      denounced by his enemies, who were jealous of his favour with the late
      King Athelstan, as a magician; and he had been waylaid, bound hand and
      foot, and thrown into a marsh.&nbsp; But he got out again, somehow, to
      cause a great deal of trouble yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests of those days were, generally, the only scholars.&nbsp; They
      were learned in many things.&nbsp; Having to make their own convents and
      monasteries on uncultivated grounds that were granted to them by the
      Crown, it was necessary that they should be good farmers and good
      gardeners, or their lands would have been too poor to support them.&nbsp;
      For the decoration of the chapels where they prayed, and for the comfort
      of the refectories where they ate and drank, it was necessary that there
      should be good carpenters, good smiths, good painters, among them.&nbsp;
      For their greater safety in sickness and accident, living alone by
      themselves in solitary places, it was necessary that they should study the
      virtues of plants and herbs, and should know how to dress cuts, burns,
      scalds, and bruises, and how to set broken limbs.&nbsp; Accordingly, they
      taught themselves, and one another, a great variety of useful arts; and
      became skilful in agriculture, medicine, surgery, and handicraft.&nbsp;
      And when they wanted the aid of any little piece of machinery, which would
      be simple enough now, but was marvellous then, to impose a trick upon the
      poor peasants, they knew very well how to make it; and <i>did</i> make it
      many a time and often, I have no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was one of the most sagacious of
      these monks.&nbsp; He was an ingenious smith, and worked at a forge in a
      little cell.&nbsp; This cell was made too short to admit of his lying at
      full length when he went to sleep&mdash;as if <i>that</i> did any good to
      anybody!&mdash;and he used to tell the most extraordinary lies about
      demons and spirits, who, he said, came there to persecute him.&nbsp; For
      instance, he related that one day when he was at work, the devil looked in
      at the little window, and tried to tempt him to lead a life of idle
      pleasure; whereupon, having his pincers in the fire, red hot, he seized
      the devil by the nose, and put him to such pain, that his bellowings were
      heard for miles and miles.&nbsp; Some people are inclined to think this
      nonsense a part of Dunstan&rsquo;s madness (for his head never quite
      recovered the fever), but I think not.&nbsp; I observe that it induced the
      ignorant people to consider him a holy man, and that it made him very
      powerful.&nbsp; Which was exactly what he always wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the coronation of the handsome boy-king Edwy, it was
      remarked by <span class="smcap">Odo</span>, Archbishop of Canterbury (who
      was a Dane by birth), that the King quietly left the coronation feast,
      while all the company were there.&nbsp; Odo, much displeased, sent his
      friend Dunstan to seek him.&nbsp; Dunstan finding him in the company of
      his beautiful young wife <span class="smcap">Elgiva</span>, and her mother
      <span class="smcap">Ethelgiva</span>, a good and virtuous lady, not only
      grossly abused them, but dragged the young King back into the
      feasting-hall by force.&nbsp; Some, again, think Dunstan did this because
      the young King&rsquo;s fair wife was his own cousin, and the monks
      objected to people marrying their own cousins; but I believe he did it,
      because he was an imperious, audacious, ill-conditioned priest, who,
      having loved a young lady himself before he became a sour monk, hated all
      love now, and everything belonging to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young King was quite old enough to feel this insult.&nbsp; Dunstan had
      been Treasurer in the last reign, and he soon charged Dunstan with having
      taken some of the last king&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; The Glastonbury Abbot
      fled to Belgium (very narrowly escaping some pursuers who were sent to put
      out his eyes, as you will wish they had, when you read what follows), and
      his abbey was given to priests who were married; whom he always, both
      before and afterwards, opposed.&nbsp; But he quickly conspired with his
      friend, Odo the Dane, to set up the King&rsquo;s young brother, <span
      class="smcap">Edgar</span>, as his rival for the throne; and, not content
      with this revenge, he caused the beautiful queen Elgiva, though a lovely
      girl of only seventeen or eighteen, to be stolen from one of the Royal
      Palaces, branded in the cheek with a red-hot iron, and sold into slavery
      in Ireland.&nbsp; But the Irish people pitied and befriended her; and they
      said, &lsquo;Let us restore the girl-queen to the boy-king, and make the
      young lovers happy!&rsquo; and they cured her of her cruel wound, and sent
      her home as beautiful as before.&nbsp; But the villain Dunstan, and that
      other villain, Odo, caused her to be waylaid at Gloucester as she was
      joyfully hurrying to join her husband, and to be hacked and hewn with
      swords, and to be barbarously maimed and lamed, and left to die.&nbsp;
      When Edwy the Fair (his people called him so, because he was so young and
      handsome) heard of her dreadful fate, he died of a broken heart; and so
      the pitiful story of the poor young wife and husband ends!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp;
      Better to be two cottagers in these better times, than king and queen of
      England in those bad days, though never so fair!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the boy-king, <span class="smcap">Edgar</span>, called the
      Peaceful, fifteen years old.&nbsp; Dunstan, being still the real king,
      drove all married priests out of the monasteries and abbeys, and replaced
      them by solitary monks like himself, of the rigid order called the
      Benedictines.&nbsp; He made himself Archbishop of Canterbury, for his
      greater glory; and exercised such power over the neighbouring British
      princes, and so collected them about the King, that once, when the King
      held his court at Chester, and went on the river Dee to visit the
      monastery of St. John, the eight oars of his boat were pulled (as the
      people used to delight in relating in stories and songs) by eight crowned
      kings, and steered by the King of England.&nbsp; As Edgar was very
      obedient to Dunstan and the monks, they took great pains to represent him
      as the best of kings.&nbsp; But he was really profligate, debauched, and
      vicious.&nbsp; He once forcibly carried off a young lady from the convent
      at Wilton; and Dunstan, pretending to be very much shocked, condemned him
      not to wear his crown upon his head for seven years&mdash;no great
      punishment, I dare say, as it can hardly have been a more comfortable
      ornament to wear, than a stewpan without a handle.&nbsp; His marriage with
      his second wife, <span class="smcap">Elfrida</span>, is one of the worst
      events of his reign.&nbsp; Hearing of the beauty of this lady, he
      despatched his favourite courtier, <span class="smcap">Athelwold</span>,
      to her father&rsquo;s castle in Devonshire, to see if she were really as
      charming as fame reported.&nbsp; Now, she was so exceedingly beautiful
      that Athelwold fell in love with her himself, and married her; but he told
      the King that she was only rich&mdash;not handsome.&nbsp; The King,
      suspecting the truth when they came home, resolved to pay the
      newly-married couple a visit; and, suddenly, told Athelwold to prepare for
      his immediate coming.&nbsp; Athelwold, terrified, confessed to his young
      wife what he had said and done, and implored her to disguise her beauty by
      some ugly dress or silly manner, that he might be safe from the King&rsquo;s
      anger.&nbsp; She promised that she would; but she was a proud woman, who
      would far rather have been a queen than the wife of a courtier.&nbsp; She
      dressed herself in her best dress, and adorned herself with her richest
      jewels; and when the King came, presently, he discovered the cheat.&nbsp;
      So, he caused his false friend, Athelwold, to be murdered in a wood, and
      married his widow, this bad Elfrida.&nbsp; Six or seven years afterwards,
      he died; and was buried, as if he had been all that the monks said he was,
      in the abbey of Glastonbury, which he&mdash;or Dunstan for him&mdash;had
      much enriched.
    </p>
    <p>
      England, in one part of this reign, was so troubled by wolves, which,
      driven out of the open country, hid themselves in the mountains of Wales
      when they were not attacking travellers and animals, that the tribute
      payable by the Welsh people was forgiven them, on condition of their
      producing, every year, three hundred wolves&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; And the
      Welshmen were so sharp upon the wolves, to save their money, that in four
      years there was not a wolf left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the boy-king, <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, called the
      Martyr, from the manner of his death.&nbsp; Elfrida had a son, named <span
      class="smcap">Ethelred</span>, for whom she claimed the throne; but
      Dunstan did not choose to favour him, and he made Edward king.&nbsp; The
      boy was hunting, one day, down in Dorsetshire, when he rode near to Corfe
      Castle, where Elfrida and Ethelred lived.&nbsp; Wishing to see them
      kindly, he rode away from his attendants and galloped to the castle gate,
      where he arrived at twilight, and blew his hunting-horn.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
      are welcome, dear King,&rsquo; said Elfrida, coming out, with her
      brightest smiles.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray you dismount and enter.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      &lsquo;Not so, dear madam,&rsquo; said the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;My company
      will miss me, and fear that I have met with some harm.&nbsp; Please you to
      give me a cup of wine, that I may drink here, in the saddle, to you and to
      my little brother, and so ride away with the good speed I have made in
      riding here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Elfrida, going in to bring the wine, whispered
      an armed servant, one of her attendants, who stole out of the darkening
      gateway, and crept round behind the King&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; As the King
      raised the cup to his lips, saying, &lsquo;Health!&rsquo; to the wicked
      woman who was smiling on him, and to his innocent brother whose hand she
      held in hers, and who was only ten years old, this armed man made a spring
      and stabbed him in the back.&nbsp; He dropped the cup and spurred his
      horse away; but, soon fainting with loss of blood, dropped from the
      saddle, and, in his fall, entangled one of his feet in the stirrup.&nbsp;
      The frightened horse dashed on; trailing his rider&rsquo;s curls upon the
      ground; dragging his smooth young face through ruts, and stones, and
      briers, and fallen leaves, and mud; until the hunters, tracking the animal&rsquo;s
      course by the King&rsquo;s blood, caught his bridle, and released the
      disfigured body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the sixth and last of the boy-kings, <span class="smcap">Ethelred</span>,
      whom Elfrida, when he cried out at the sight of his murdered brother
      riding away from the castle gate, unmercifully beat with a torch which she
      snatched from one of the attendants.&nbsp; The people so disliked this
      boy, on account of his cruel mother and the murder she had done to promote
      him, that Dunstan would not have had him for king, but would have made
      <span class="smcap">Edgitha</span>, the daughter of the dead King Edgar,
      and of the lady whom he stole out of the convent at Wilton, Queen of
      England, if she would have consented.&nbsp; But she knew the stories of
      the youthful kings too well, and would not be persuaded from the convent
      where she lived in peace; so, Dunstan put Ethelred on the throne, having
      no one else to put there, and gave him the nickname of <span class="smcap">The
      Unready</span>&mdash;knowing that he wanted resolution and firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Elfrida possessed great influence over the young King, but, as
      he grew older and came of age, her influence declined.&nbsp; The infamous
      woman, not having it in her power to do any more evil, then retired from
      court, and, according, to the fashion of the time, built churches and
      monasteries, to expiate her guilt.&nbsp; As if a church, with a steeple
      reaching to the very stars, would have been any sign of true repentance
      for the blood of the poor boy, whose murdered form was trailed at his
      horse&rsquo;s heels!&nbsp; As if she could have buried her wickedness
      beneath the senseless stones of the whole world, piled up one upon
      another, for the monks to live in!
    </p>
    <p>
      About the ninth or tenth year of this reign, Dunstan died.&nbsp; He was
      growing old then, but was as stern and artful as ever.&nbsp; Two
      circumstances that happened in connexion with him, in this reign of
      Ethelred, made a great noise.&nbsp; Once, he was present at a meeting of
      the Church, when the question was discussed whether priests should have
      permission to marry; and, as he sat with his head hung down, apparently
      thinking about it, a voice seemed to come out of a crucifix in the room,
      and warn the meeting to be of his opinion.&nbsp; This was some juggling of
      Dunstan&rsquo;s, and was probably his own voice disguised.&nbsp; But he
      played off a worse juggle than that, soon afterwards; for, another meeting
      being held on the same subject, and he and his supporters being seated on
      one side of a great room, and their opponents on the other, he rose and
      said, &lsquo;To Christ himself, as judge, do I commit this cause!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      Immediately on these words being spoken, the floor where the opposite
      party sat gave way, and some were killed and many wounded.&nbsp; You may
      be pretty sure that it had been weakened under Dunstan&rsquo;s direction,
      and that it fell at Dunstan&rsquo;s signal.&nbsp; <i>His</i> part of the
      floor did not go down.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; He was too good a workman for
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he died, the monks settled that he was a Saint, and called him Saint
      Dunstan ever afterwards.&nbsp; They might just as well have settled that
      he was a coach-horse, and could just as easily have called him one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelred the Unready was glad enough, I dare say, to be rid of this holy
      saint; but, left to himself, he was a poor weak king, and his reign was a
      reign of defeat and shame.&nbsp; The restless Danes, led by <span
      class="smcap">Sweyn</span>, a son of the King of Denmark who had
      quarrelled with his father and had been banished from home, again came
      into England, and, year after year, attacked and despoiled large towns.&nbsp;
      To coax these sea-kings away, the weak Ethelred paid them money; but, the
      more money he paid, the more money the Danes wanted.&nbsp; At first, he
      gave them ten thousand pounds; on their next invasion, sixteen thousand
      pounds; on their next invasion, four and twenty thousand pounds: to pay
      which large sums, the unfortunate English people were heavily taxed.&nbsp;
      But, as the Danes still came back and wanted more, he thought it would be
      a good plan to marry into some powerful foreign family that would help him
      with soldiers.&nbsp; So, in the year one thousand and two, he courted and
      married Emma, the sister of Richard Duke of Normandy; a lady who was
      called the Flower of Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, a terrible deed was done in England, the like of which was never
      done on English ground before or since.&nbsp; On the thirteenth of
      November, in pursuance of secret instructions sent by the King over the
      whole country, the inhabitants of every town and city armed, and murdered
      all the Danes who were their neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young and old, babies and soldiers, men and women, every Dane was killed.&nbsp;
      No doubt there were among them many ferocious men who had done the English
      great wrong, and whose pride and insolence, in swaggering in the houses of
      the English and insulting their wives and daughters, had become
      unbearable; but no doubt there were also among them many peaceful
      Christian Danes who had married English women and become like English men.&nbsp;
      They were all slain, even to <span class="smcap">Gunhilda</span>, the
      sister of the King of Denmark, married to an English lord; who was first
      obliged to see the murder of her husband and her child, and then was
      killed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King of the sea-kings heard of this deed of blood, he swore that
      he would have a great revenge.&nbsp; He raised an army, and a mightier
      fleet of ships than ever yet had sailed to England; and in all his army
      there was not a slave or an old man, but every soldier was a free man, and
      the son of a free man, and in the prime of life, and sworn to be revenged
      upon the English nation, for the massacre of that dread thirteenth of
      November, when his countrymen and countrywomen, and the little children
      whom they loved, were killed with fire and sword.&nbsp; And so, the
      sea-kings came to England in many great ships, each bearing the flag of
      its own commander.&nbsp; Golden eagles, ravens, dragons, dolphins, beasts
      of prey, threatened England from the prows of those ships, as they came
      onward through the water; and were reflected in the shining shields that
      hung upon their sides.&nbsp; The ship that bore the standard of the King
      of the sea-kings was carved and painted like a mighty serpent; and the
      King in his anger prayed that the Gods in whom he trusted might all desert
      him, if his serpent did not strike its fangs into England&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed it did.&nbsp; For, the great army landing from the great fleet,
      near Exeter, went forward, laying England waste, and striking their lances
      in the earth as they advanced, or throwing them into rivers, in token of
      their making all the island theirs.&nbsp; In remembrance of the black
      November night when the Danes were murdered, wheresoever the invaders
      came, they made the Saxons prepare and spread for them great feasts; and
      when they had eaten those feasts, and had drunk a curse to England with
      wild rejoicings, they drew their swords, and killed their Saxon
      entertainers, and marched on.&nbsp; For six long years they carried on
      this war: burning the crops, farmhouses, barns, mills, granaries; killing
      the labourers in the fields; preventing the seed from being sown in the
      ground; causing famine and starvation; leaving only heaps of ruin and
      smoking ashes, where they had found rich towns.&nbsp; To crown this
      misery, English officers and men deserted, and even the favourites of
      Ethelred the Unready, becoming traitors, seized many of the English ships,
      turned pirates against their own country, and aided by a storm occasioned
      the loss of nearly the whole English navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one man of note, at this miserable pass, who was true to his
      country and the feeble King.&nbsp; He was a priest, and a brave one.&nbsp;
      For twenty days, the Archbishop of Canterbury defended that city against
      its Danish besiegers; and when a traitor in the town threw the gates open
      and admitted them, he said, in chains, &lsquo;I will not buy my life with
      money that must be extorted from the suffering people.&nbsp; Do with me
      what you please!&rsquo;&nbsp; Again and again, he steadily refused to
      purchase his release with gold wrung from the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, the Danes being tired of this, and being assembled at a drunken
      merry-making, had him brought into the feasting-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, bishop,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;we want gold!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round on the crowd of angry faces; from the shaggy beards close
      to him, to the shaggy beards against the walls, where men were mounted on
      tables and forms to see him over the heads of others: and he knew that his
      time was come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no gold,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get it, bishop!&rsquo; they all thundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, I have often told you I will not,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gathered closer round him, threatening, but he stood unmoved.&nbsp;
      Then, one man struck him; then, another; then a cursing soldier picked up
      from a heap in a corner of the hall, where fragments had been rudely
      thrown at dinner, a great ox-bone, and cast it at his face, from which the
      blood came spurting forth; then, others ran to the same heap, and knocked
      him down with other bones, and bruised and battered him; until one soldier
      whom he had baptised (willing, as I hope for the sake of that soldier&rsquo;s
      soul, to shorten the sufferings of the good man) struck him dead with his
      battle-axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ethelred had had the heart to emulate the courage of this noble
      archbishop, he might have done something yet.&nbsp; But he paid the Danes
      forty-eight thousand pounds, instead, and gained so little by the cowardly
      act, that Sweyn soon afterwards came over to subdue all England.&nbsp; So
      broken was the attachment of the English people, by this time, to their
      incapable King and their forlorn country which could not protect them,
      that they welcomed Sweyn on all sides, as a deliverer.&nbsp; London
      faithfully stood out, as long as the King was within its walls; but, when
      he sneaked away, it also welcomed the Dane.&nbsp; Then, all was over; and
      the King took refuge abroad with the Duke of Normandy, who had already
      given shelter to the King&rsquo;s wife, once the Flower of that country,
      and to her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the English people, in spite of their sad sufferings, could not
      quite forget the great King Alfred and the Saxon race.&nbsp; When Sweyn
      died suddenly, in little more than a month after he had been proclaimed
      King of England, they generously sent to Ethelred, to say that they would
      have him for their King again, &lsquo;if he would only govern them better
      than he had governed them before.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Unready, instead of
      coming himself, sent Edward, one of his sons, to make promises for him.&nbsp;
      At last, he followed, and the English declared him King.&nbsp; The Danes
      declared <span class="smcap">Canute</span>, the son of Sweyn, King.&nbsp;
      Thus, direful war began again, and lasted for three years, when the
      Unready died.&nbsp; And I know of nothing better that he did, in all his
      reign of eight and thirty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Canute to be King now?&nbsp; Not over the Saxons, they said; they must
      have <span class="smcap">Edmund</span>, one of the sons of the Unready,
      who was surnamed <span class="smcap">Ironside</span>, because of his
      strength and stature.&nbsp; Edmund and Canute thereupon fell to, and
      fought five battles&mdash;O unhappy England, what a fighting-ground it
      was!&mdash;and then Ironside, who was a big man, proposed to Canute, who
      was a little man, that they two should fight it out in single combat.&nbsp;
      If Canute had been the big man, he would probably have said yes, but,
      being the little man, he decidedly said no.&nbsp; However, he declared
      that he was willing to divide the kingdom&mdash;to take all that lay north
      of Watling Street, as the old Roman military road from Dover to Chester
      was called, and to give Ironside all that lay south of it.&nbsp; Most men
      being weary of so much bloodshed, this was done.&nbsp; But Canute soon
      became sole King of England; for Ironside died suddenly within two months.&nbsp;
      Some think that he was killed, and killed by Canute&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp;
      No one knows.

    </p>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER CANUTE THE DANE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Canute reigned eighteen years.&nbsp; He was a merciless King at first.&nbsp;
      After he had clasped the hands of the Saxon chiefs, in token of the
      sincerity with which he swore to be just and good to them in return for
      their acknowledging him, he denounced and slew many of them, as well as
      many relations of the late King.&nbsp; &lsquo;He who brings me the head of
      one of my enemies,&rsquo; he used to say, &lsquo;shall be dearer to me
      than a brother.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he was so severe in hunting down his
      enemies, that he must have got together a pretty large family of these
      dear brothers.&nbsp; He was strongly inclined to kill <span class="smcap">Edmund</span>
      and <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, two children, sons of poor
      Ironside; but, being afraid to do so in England, he sent them over to the
      King of Sweden, with a request that the King would be so good as &lsquo;dispose
      of them.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the King of Sweden had been like many, many other
      men of that day, he would have had their innocent throats cut; but he was
      a kind man, and brought them up tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normandy ran much in Canute&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; In Normandy were the two
      children of the late king&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edward</span> and
      <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> by name; and their uncle the Duke might
      one day claim the crown for them.&nbsp; But the Duke showed so little
      inclination to do so now, that he proposed to Canute to marry his sister,
      the widow of The Unready; who, being but a showy flower, and caring for
      nothing so much as becoming a queen again, left her children and was
      wedded to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successful and triumphant, assisted by the valour of the English in his
      foreign wars, and with little strife to trouble him at home, Canute had a
      prosperous reign, and made many improvements.&nbsp; He was a poet and a
      musician.&nbsp; He grew sorry, as he grew older, for the blood he had shed
      at first; and went to Rome in a Pilgrim&rsquo;s dress, by way of washing
      it out.&nbsp; He gave a great deal of money to foreigners on his journey;
      but he took it from the English before he started.&nbsp; On the whole,
      however, he certainly became a far better man when he had no opposition to
      contend with, and was as great a King as England had known for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old writers of history relate how that Canute was one day disgusted
      with his courtiers for their flattery, and how he caused his chair to be
      set on the sea-shore, and feigned to command the tide as it came up not to
      wet the edge of his robe, for the land was his; how the tide came up, of
      course, without regarding him; and how he then turned to his flatterers,
      and rebuked them, saying, what was the might of any earthly king, to the
      might of the Creator, who could say unto the sea, &lsquo;Thus far shalt
      thou go, and no farther!&rsquo;&nbsp; We may learn from this, I think,
      that a little sense will go a long way in a king; and that courtiers are
      not easily cured of flattery, nor kings of a liking for it.&nbsp; If the
      courtiers of Canute had not known, long before, that the King was fond of
      flattery, they would have known better than to offer it in such large
      doses.&nbsp; And if they had not known that he was vain of this speech
      (anything but a wonderful speech it seems to me, if a good child had made
      it), they would not have been at such great pains to repeat it.&nbsp; I
      fancy I see them all on the sea-shore together; the King&rsquo;s chair
      sinking in the sand; the King in a mighty good humour with his own wisdom;
      and the courtiers pretending to be quite stunned by it!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not the sea alone that is bidden to go &lsquo;thus far, and no
      farther.&rsquo;&nbsp; The great command goes forth to all the kings upon
      the earth, and went to Canute in the year one thousand and thirty-five,
      and stretched him dead upon his bed.&nbsp; Beside it, stood his Norman
      wife.&nbsp; Perhaps, as the King looked his last upon her, he, who had so
      often thought distrustfully of Normandy, long ago, thought once more of
      the two exiled Princes in their uncle&rsquo;s court, and of the little
      favour they could feel for either Danes or Saxons, and of a rising cloud
      in Normandy that slowly moved towards England.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD HAREFOOT, HARDICANUTE, AND EDWARD
      THE CONFESSOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Canute left three sons, by name <span class="smcap">Sweyn</span>, <span
      class="smcap">Harold</span>, and <span class="smcap">Hardicanute</span>;
      but his Queen, Emma, once the Flower of Normandy, was the mother of only
      Hardicanute.&nbsp; Canute had wished his dominions to be divided between
      the three, and had wished Harold to have England; but the Saxon people in
      the South of England, headed by a nobleman with great possessions, called
      the powerful <span class="smcap">Earl Godwin</span> (who is said to have
      been originally a poor cow-boy), opposed this, and desired to have,
      instead, either Hardicanute, or one of the two exiled Princes who were
      over in Normandy.&nbsp; It seemed so certain that there would be more
      bloodshed to settle this dispute, that many people left their homes, and
      took refuge in the woods and swamps.&nbsp; Happily, however, it was agreed
      to refer the whole question to a great meeting at Oxford, which decided
      that Harold should have all the country north of the Thames, with London
      for his capital city, and that Hardicanute should have all the south.&nbsp;
      The quarrel was so arranged; and, as Hardicanute was in Denmark troubling
      himself very little about anything but eating and getting drunk, his
      mother and Earl Godwin governed the south for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had hardly begun to do so, and the trembling people who had hidden
      themselves were scarcely at home again, when Edward, the elder of the two
      exiled Princes, came over from Normandy with a few followers, to claim the
      English Crown.&nbsp; His mother Emma, however, who only cared for her last
      son Hardicanute, instead of assisting him, as he expected, opposed him so
      strongly with all her influence that he was very soon glad to get safely
      back.&nbsp; His brother Alfred was not so fortunate.&nbsp; Believing in an
      affectionate letter, written some time afterwards to him and his brother,
      in his mother&rsquo;s name (but whether really with or without his mother&rsquo;s
      knowledge is now uncertain), he allowed himself to be tempted over to
      England, with a good force of soldiers, and landing on the Kentish coast,
      and being met and welcomed by Earl Godwin, proceeded into Surrey, as far
      as the town of Guildford.&nbsp; Here, he and his men halted in the evening
      to rest, having still the Earl in their company; who had ordered lodgings
      and good cheer for them.&nbsp; But, in the dead of the night, when they
      were off their guard, being divided into small parties sleeping soundly
      after a long march and a plentiful supper in different houses, they were
      set upon by the King&rsquo;s troops, and taken prisoners.&nbsp; Next
      morning they were drawn out in a line, to the number of six hundred men,
      and were barbarously tortured and killed; with the exception of every
      tenth man, who was sold into slavery.&nbsp; As to the wretched Prince
      Alfred, he was stripped naked, tied to a horse and sent away into the Isle
      of Ely, where his eyes were torn out of his head, and where in a few days
      he miserably died.&nbsp; I am not sure that the Earl had wilfully
      entrapped him, but I suspect it strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold was now King all over England, though it is doubtful whether the
      Archbishop of Canterbury (the greater part of the priests were Saxons, and
      not friendly to the Danes) ever consented to crown him.&nbsp; Crowned or
      uncrowned, with the Archbishop&rsquo;s leave or without it, he was King
      for four years: after which short reign he died, and was buried; having
      never done much in life but go a hunting.&nbsp; He was such a fast runner
      at this, his favourite sport, that the people called him Harold Harefoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardicanute was then at Bruges, in Flanders, plotting, with his mother
      (who had gone over there after the cruel murder of Prince Alfred), for the
      invasion of England.&nbsp; The Danes and Saxons, finding themselves
      without a King, and dreading new disputes, made common cause, and joined
      in inviting him to occupy the Throne.&nbsp; He consented, and soon
      troubled them enough; for he brought over numbers of Danes, and taxed the
      people so insupportably to enrich those greedy favourites that there were
      many insurrections, especially one at Worcester, where the citizens rose
      and killed his tax-collectors; in revenge for which he burned their city.&nbsp;
      He was a brutal King, whose first public act was to order the dead body of
      poor Harold Harefoot to be dug up, beheaded, and thrown into the river.&nbsp;
      His end was worthy of such a beginning.&nbsp; He fell down drunk, with a
      goblet of wine in his hand, at a wedding-feast at Lambeth, given in honour
      of the marriage of his standard-bearer, a Dane named <span class="smcap">Towed
      the Proud</span>.&nbsp; And he never spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, afterwards called by the monks <span
      class="smcap">The Confessor</span>, succeeded; and his first act was to
      oblige his mother Emma, who had favoured him so little, to retire into the
      country; where she died some ten years afterwards.&nbsp; He was the exiled
      prince whose brother Alfred had been so foully killed.&nbsp; He had been
      invited over from Normandy by Hardicanute, in the course of his short
      reign of two years, and had been handsomely treated at court.&nbsp; His
      cause was now favoured by the powerful Earl Godwin, and he was soon made
      King.&nbsp; This Earl had been suspected by the people, ever since Prince
      Alfred&rsquo;s cruel death; he had even been tried in the last reign for
      the Prince&rsquo;s murder, but had been pronounced not guilty; chiefly, as
      it was supposed, because of a present he had made to the swinish King, of
      a gilded ship with a figure-head of solid gold, and a crew of eighty
      splendidly armed men.&nbsp; It was his interest to help the new King with
      his power, if the new King would help him against the popular distrust and
      hatred.&nbsp; So they made a bargain.&nbsp; Edward the Confessor got the
      Throne.&nbsp; The Earl got more power and more land, and his daughter
      Editha was made queen; for it was a part of their compact that the King
      should take her for his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, although she was a gentle lady, in all things worthy to be beloved&mdash;good,
      beautiful, sensible, and kind&mdash;the King from the first neglected her.&nbsp;
      Her father and her six proud brothers, resenting this cold treatment,
      harassed the King greatly by exerting all their power to make him
      unpopular.&nbsp; Having lived so long in Normandy, he preferred the
      Normans to the English.&nbsp; He made a Norman Archbishop, and Norman
      Bishops; his great officers and favourites were all Normans; he introduced
      the Norman fashions and the Norman language; in imitation of the state
      custom of Normandy, he attached a great seal to his state documents,
      instead of merely marking them, as the Saxon Kings had done, with the sign
      of the cross&mdash;just as poor people who have never been taught to
      write, now make the same mark for their names.&nbsp; All this, the
      powerful Earl Godwin and his six proud sons represented to the people as
      disfavour shown towards the English; and thus they daily increased their
      own power, and daily diminished the power of the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were greatly helped by an event that occurred when he had reigned
      eight years.&nbsp; Eustace, Earl of Bologne, who had married the King&rsquo;s
      sister, came to England on a visit.&nbsp; After staying at the court some
      time, he set forth, with his numerous train of attendants, to return home.&nbsp;
      They were to embark at Dover.&nbsp; Entering that peaceful town in armour,
      they took possession of the best houses, and noisily demanded to be lodged
      and entertained without payment.&nbsp; One of the bold men of Dover, who
      would not endure to have these domineering strangers jingling their heavy
      swords and iron corselets up and down his house, eating his meat and
      drinking his strong liquor, stood in his doorway and refused admission to
      the first armed man who came there.&nbsp; The armed man drew, and wounded
      him.&nbsp; The man of Dover struck the armed man dead.&nbsp; Intelligence
      of what he had done, spreading through the streets to where the Count
      Eustace and his men were standing by their horses, bridle in hand, they
      passionately mounted, galloped to the house, surrounded it, forced their
      way in (the doors and windows being closed when they came up), and killed
      the man of Dover at his own fireside.&nbsp; They then clattered through
      the streets, cutting down and riding over men, women, and children.&nbsp;
      This did not last long, you may believe.&nbsp; The men of Dover set upon
      them with great fury, killed nineteen of the foreigners, wounded many
      more, and, blockading the road to the port so that they should not embark,
      beat them out of the town by the way they had come.&nbsp; Hereupon, Count
      Eustace rides as hard as man can ride to Gloucester, where Edward is,
      surrounded by Norman monks and Norman lords.&nbsp; &lsquo;Justice!&rsquo;
      cries the Count, &lsquo;upon the men of Dover, who have set upon and slain
      my people!&rsquo;&nbsp; The King sends immediately for the powerful Earl
      Godwin, who happens to be near; reminds him that Dover is under his
      government; and orders him to repair to Dover and do military execution on
      the inhabitants.&nbsp; &lsquo;It does not become you,&rsquo; says the
      proud Earl in reply, &lsquo;to condemn without a hearing those whom you
      have sworn to protect.&nbsp; I will not do it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, therefore, summoned the Earl, on pain of banishment and loss of
      his titles and property, to appear before the court to answer this
      disobedience.&nbsp; The Earl refused to appear.&nbsp; He, his eldest son
      Harold, and his second son Sweyn, hastily raised as many fighting men as
      their utmost power could collect, and demanded to have Count Eustace and
      his followers surrendered to the justice of the country.&nbsp; The King,
      in his turn, refused to give them up, and raised a strong force.&nbsp;
      After some treaty and delay, the troops of the great Earl and his sons
      began to fall off.&nbsp; The Earl, with a part of his family and abundance
      of treasure, sailed to Flanders; Harold escaped to Ireland; and the power
      of the great family was for that time gone in England.&nbsp; But, the
      people did not forget them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Edward the Confessor, with the true meanness of a mean spirit,
      visited his dislike of the once powerful father and sons upon the helpless
      daughter and sister, his unoffending wife, whom all who saw her (her
      husband and his monks excepted) loved.&nbsp; He seized rapaciously upon
      her fortune and her jewels, and allowing her only one attendant, confined
      her in a gloomy convent, of which a sister of his&mdash;no doubt an
      unpleasant lady after his own heart&mdash;was abbess or jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having got Earl Godwin and his six sons well out of his way, the King
      favoured the Normans more than ever.&nbsp; He invited over <span
      class="smcap">William</span>, <span class="smcap">Duke Of Normandy</span>,
      the son of that Duke who had received him and his murdered brother long
      ago, and of a peasant girl, a tanner&rsquo;s daughter, with whom that Duke
      had fallen in love for her beauty as he saw her washing clothes in a
      brook.&nbsp; William, who was a great warrior, with a passion for fine
      horses, dogs, and arms, accepted the invitation; and the Normans in
      England, finding themselves more numerous than ever when he arrived with
      his retinue, and held in still greater honour at court than before, became
      more and more haughty towards the people, and were more and more disliked
      by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Earl Godwin, though he was abroad, knew well how the people felt;
      for, with part of the treasure he had carried away with him, he kept spies
      and agents in his pay all over England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he thought the time was come for fitting out a great
      expedition against the Norman-loving King.&nbsp; With it, he sailed to the
      Isle of Wight, where he was joined by his son Harold, the most gallant and
      brave of all his family.&nbsp; And so the father and son came sailing up
      the Thames to Southwark; great numbers of the people declaring for them,
      and shouting for the English Earl and the English Harold, against the
      Norman favourites!
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was at first as blind and stubborn as kings usually have been
      whensoever they have been in the hands of monks.&nbsp; But the people
      rallied so thickly round the old Earl and his son, and the old Earl was so
      steady in demanding without bloodshed the restoration of himself and his
      family to their rights, that at last the court took the alarm.&nbsp; The
      Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Norman Bishop of London,
      surrounded by their retainers, fought their way out of London, and escaped
      from Essex to France in a fishing-boat.&nbsp; The other Norman favourites
      dispersed in all directions.&nbsp; The old Earl and his sons (except
      Sweyn, who had committed crimes against the law) were restored to their
      possessions and dignities.&nbsp; Editha, the virtuous and lovely Queen of
      the insensible King, was triumphantly released from her prison, the
      convent, and once more sat in her chair of state, arrayed in the jewels of
      which, when she had no champion to support her rights, her cold-blooded
      husband had deprived her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Earl Godwin did not long enjoy his restored fortune.&nbsp; He fell
      down in a fit at the King&rsquo;s table, and died upon the third day
      afterwards.&nbsp; Harold succeeded to his power, and to a far higher place
      in the attachment of the people than his father had ever held.&nbsp; By
      his valour he subdued the King&rsquo;s enemies in many bloody fights.&nbsp;
      He was vigorous against rebels in Scotland&mdash;this was the time when
      Macbeth slew Duncan, upon which event our English Shakespeare, hundreds of
      years afterwards, wrote his great tragedy; and he killed the restless
      Welsh King <span class="smcap">Griffith</span>, and brought his head to
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Harold was doing at sea, when he was driven on the French coast by a
      tempest, is not at all certain; nor does it at all matter.&nbsp; That his
      ship was forced by a storm on that shore, and that he was taken prisoner,
      there is no doubt.&nbsp; In those barbarous days, all shipwrecked
      strangers were taken prisoners, and obliged to pay ransom.&nbsp; So, a
      certain Count Guy, who was the Lord of Ponthieu where Harold&rsquo;s
      disaster happened, seized him, instead of relieving him like a hospitable
      and Christian lord as he ought to have done, and expected to make a very
      good thing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Harold sent off immediately to Duke William of Normandy, complaining
      of this treatment; and the Duke no sooner heard of it than he ordered
      Harold to be escorted to the ancient town of Rouen, where he then was, and
      where he received him as an honoured guest.&nbsp; Now, some writers tell
      us that Edward the Confessor, who was by this time old and had no
      children, had made a will, appointing Duke William of Normandy his
      successor, and had informed the Duke of his having done so.&nbsp; There is
      no doubt that he was anxious about his successor; because he had even
      invited over, from abroad, <span class="smcap">Edward the Outlaw</span>, a
      son of Ironside, who had come to England with his wife and three children,
      but whom the King had strangely refused to see when he did come, and who
      had died in London suddenly (princes were terribly liable to sudden death
      in those days), and had been buried in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.&nbsp;
      The King might possibly have made such a will; or, having always been fond
      of the Normans, he might have encouraged Norman William to aspire to the
      English crown, by something that he said to him when he was staying at the
      English court.&nbsp; But, certainly William did now aspire to it; and
      knowing that Harold would be a powerful rival, he called together a great
      assembly of his nobles, offered Harold his daughter <span class="smcap">Adele</span>
      in marriage, informed him that he meant on King Edward&rsquo;s death to
      claim the English crown as his own inheritance, and required Harold then
      and there to swear to aid him.&nbsp; Harold, being in the Duke&rsquo;s
      power, took this oath upon the Missal, or Prayer-book.&nbsp; It is a good
      example of the superstitions of the monks, that this Missal, instead of
      being placed upon a table, was placed upon a tub; which, when Harold had
      sworn, was uncovered, and shown to be full of dead men&rsquo;s bones&mdash;bones,
      as the monks pretended, of saints.&nbsp; This was supposed to make Harold&rsquo;s
      oath a great deal more impressive and binding.&nbsp; As if the great name
      of the Creator of Heaven and earth could be made more solemn by a
      knuckle-bone, or a double-tooth, or a finger-nail, of Dunstan!
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week or two after Harold&rsquo;s return to England, the dreary
      old Confessor was found to be dying.&nbsp; After wandering in his mind
      like a very weak old man, he died.&nbsp; As he had put himself entirely in
      the hands of the monks when he was alive, they praised him lustily when he
      was dead.&nbsp; They had gone so far, already, as to persuade him that he
      could work miracles; and had brought people afflicted with a bad disorder
      of the skin, to him, to be touched and cured.&nbsp; This was called
      &lsquo;touching for the King&rsquo;s Evil,&rsquo; which afterwards became
      a royal custom.&nbsp; You know, however, Who really touched the sick, and
      healed them; and you know His sacred name is not among the dusty line of
      human kings.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD THE SECOND, AND CONQUERED BY THE
      NORMANS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harold was crowned King of England on the very day of the maudlin
      Confessor&rsquo;s funeral.&nbsp; He had good need to be quick about it.&nbsp;
      When the news reached Norman William, hunting in his park at Rouen, he
      dropped his bow, returned to his palace, called his nobles to council, and
      presently sent ambassadors to Harold, calling on him to keep his oath and
      resign the Crown.&nbsp; Harold would do no such thing.&nbsp; The barons of
      France leagued together round Duke William for the invasion of England.&nbsp;
      Duke William promised freely to distribute English wealth and English
      lands among them.&nbsp; The Pope sent to Normandy a consecrated banner,
      and a ring containing a hair which he warranted to have grown on the head
      of Saint Peter.&nbsp; He blessed the enterprise; and cursed Harold; and
      requested that the Normans would pay &lsquo;Peter&rsquo;s Pence&rsquo;&mdash;or
      a tax to himself of a penny a year on every house&mdash;a little more
      regularly in future, if they could make it convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Harold had a rebel brother in Flanders, who was a vassal of <span
      class="smcap">Harold Hardrada</span>, King of Norway.&nbsp; This brother,
      and this Norwegian King, joining their forces against England, with Duke
      William&rsquo;s help, won a fight in which the English were commanded by
      two nobles; and then besieged York.&nbsp; Harold, who was waiting for the
      Normans on the coast at Hastings, with his army, marched to Stamford
      Bridge upon the river Derwent to give them instant battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found them drawn up in a hollow circle, marked out by their shining
      spears.&nbsp; Riding round this circle at a distance, to survey it, he saw
      a brave figure on horseback, in a blue mantle and a bright helmet, whose
      horse suddenly stumbled and threw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is that man who has fallen?&rsquo; Harold asked of one of his
      captains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The King of Norway,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a tall and stately king,&rsquo; said Harold, &lsquo;but his
      end is near.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He added, in a little while, &lsquo;Go yonder to my brother, and tell him,
      if he withdraw his troops, he shall be Earl of Northumberland, and rich
      and powerful in England.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain rode away and gave the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will he give to my friend the King of Norway?&rsquo; asked the
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seven feet of earth for a grave,&rsquo; replied the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more?&rsquo; returned the brother, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The King of Norway being a tall man, perhaps a little more,&rsquo;
      replied the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ride back!&rsquo; said the brother, &lsquo;and tell King Harold to
      make ready for the fight!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, very soon.&nbsp; And such a fight King Harold led against that
      force, that his brother, and the Norwegian King, and every chief of note
      in all their host, except the Norwegian King&rsquo;s son, Olave, to whom
      he gave honourable dismissal, were left dead upon the field.&nbsp; The
      victorious army marched to York.&nbsp; As King Harold sat there at the
      feast, in the midst of all his company, a stir was heard at the doors; and
      messengers all covered with mire from riding far and fast through broken
      ground came hurrying in, to report that the Normans had landed in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligence was true.&nbsp; They had been tossed about by contrary
      winds, and some of their ships had been wrecked.&nbsp; A part of their own
      shore, to which they had been driven back, was strewn with Norman bodies.&nbsp;
      But they had once more made sail, led by the Duke&rsquo;s own galley, a
      present from his wife, upon the prow whereof the figure of a golden boy
      stood pointing towards England.&nbsp; By day, the banner of the three
      Lions of Normandy, the diverse coloured sails, the gilded vans, the many
      decorations of this gorgeous ship, had glittered in the sun and sunny
      water; by night, a light had sparkled like a star at her mast-head.&nbsp;
      And now, encamped near Hastings, with their leader lying in the old Roman
      castle of Pevensey, the English retiring in all directions, the land for
      miles around scorched and smoking, fired and pillaged, was the whole
      Norman power, hopeful and strong on English ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold broke up the feast and hurried to London.&nbsp; Within a week, his
      army was ready.&nbsp; He sent out spies to ascertain the Norman strength.&nbsp;
      William took them, caused them to be led through his whole camp, and then
      dismissed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Normans,&rsquo; said these spies to Harold,
      &lsquo;are not bearded on the upper lip as we English are, but are shorn.&nbsp;
      They are priests.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My men,&rsquo; replied Harold, with
      a laugh, &lsquo;will find those priests good soldiers!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Saxons,&rsquo; reported Duke William&rsquo;s outposts of Norman
      soldiers, who were instructed to retire as King Harold&rsquo;s army
      advanced, &lsquo;rush on us through their pillaged country with the fury
      of madmen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let them come, and come soon!&rsquo; said Duke William.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some proposals for a reconciliation were made, but were soon abandoned.&nbsp;
      In the middle of the month of October, in the year one thousand and
      sixty-six, the Normans and the English came front to front.&nbsp; All
      night the armies lay encamped before each other, in a part of the country
      then called Senlac, now called (in remembrance of them) Battle.&nbsp; With
      the first dawn of day, they arose.&nbsp; There, in the faint light, were
      the English on a hill; a wood behind them; in their midst, the Royal
      banner, representing a fighting warrior, woven in gold thread, adorned
      with precious stones; beneath the banner, as it rustled in the wind, stood
      King Harold on foot, with two of his remaining brothers by his side;
      around them, still and silent as the dead, clustered the whole English
      army&mdash;every soldier covered by his shield, and bearing in his hand
      his dreaded English battle-axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an opposite hill, in three lines, archers, foot-soldiers, horsemen, was
      the Norman force.&nbsp; Of a sudden, a great battle-cry, &lsquo;God help
      us!&rsquo; burst from the Norman lines.&nbsp; The English answered with
      their own battle-cry, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s Rood!&nbsp; Holy Rood!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      The Normans then came sweeping down the hill to attack the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one tall Norman Knight who rode before the Norman army on a
      prancing horse, throwing up his heavy sword and catching it, and singing
      of the bravery of his countrymen.&nbsp; An English Knight, who rode out
      from the English force to meet him, fell by this Knight&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
      Another English Knight rode out, and he fell too.&nbsp; But then a third
      rode out, and killed the Norman.&nbsp; This was in the first beginning of
      the fight.&nbsp; It soon raged everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English, keeping side by side in a great mass, cared no more for the
      showers of Norman arrows than if they had been showers of Norman rain.&nbsp;
      When the Norman horsemen rode against them, with their battle-axes they
      cut men and horses down.&nbsp; The Normans gave way.&nbsp; The English
      pressed forward.&nbsp; A cry went forth among the Norman troops that Duke
      William was killed.&nbsp; Duke William took off his helmet, in order that
      his face might be distinctly seen, and rode along the line before his men.&nbsp;
      This gave them courage.&nbsp; As they turned again to face the English,
      some of their Norman horse divided the pursuing body of the English from
      the rest, and thus all that foremost portion of the English army fell,
      fighting bravely.&nbsp; The main body still remaining firm, heedless of
      the Norman arrows, and with their battle-axes cutting down the crowds of
      horsemen when they rode up, like forests of young trees, Duke William
      pretended to retreat.&nbsp; The eager English followed.&nbsp; The Norman
      army closed again, and fell upon them with great slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still,&rsquo; said Duke William, &lsquo;there are thousands of the
      English, firms as rocks around their King.&nbsp; Shoot upward, Norman
      archers, that your arrows may fall down upon their faces!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rose high, and sank, and the battle still raged.&nbsp; Through all
      the wild October day, the clash and din resounded in the air.&nbsp; In the
      red sunset, and in the white moonlight, heaps upon heaps of dead men lay
      strewn, a dreadful spectacle, all over the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Harold, wounded with an arrow in the eye, was nearly blind.&nbsp; His
      brothers were already killed.&nbsp; Twenty Norman Knights, whose battered
      armour had flashed fiery and golden in the sunshine all day long, and now
      looked silvery in the moonlight, dashed forward to seize the Royal banner
      from the English Knights and soldiers, still faithfully collected round
      their blinded King.&nbsp; The King received a mortal wound, and dropped.&nbsp;
      The English broke and fled.&nbsp; The Normans rallied, and the day was
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      O what a sight beneath the moon and stars, when lights were shining in the
      tent of the victorious Duke William, which was pitched near the spot where
      Harold fell&mdash;and he and his knights were carousing, within&mdash;and
      soldiers with torches, going slowly to and fro, without, sought for the
      corpse of Harold among piles of dead&mdash;and the Warrior, worked in
      golden thread and precious stones, lay low, all torn and soiled with blood&mdash;and
      the three Norman Lions kept watch over the field!

    </p>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE FIRST, THE NORMAN CONQUEROR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon the ground where the brave Harold fell, William the Norman afterwards
      founded an abbey, which, under the name of Battle Abbey, was a rich and
      splendid place through many a troubled year, though now it is a grey ruin
      overgrown with ivy.&nbsp; But the first work he had to do, was to conquer
      the English thoroughly; and that, as you know by this time, was hard work
      for any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ravaged several counties; he burned and plundered many towns; he laid
      waste scores upon scores of miles of pleasant country; he destroyed
      innumerable lives.&nbsp; At length <span class="smcap">Stigand</span>,
      Archbishop of Canterbury, with other representatives of the clergy and the
      people, went to his camp, and submitted to him.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Edgar</span>,
      the insignificant son of Edmund Ironside, was proclaimed King by others,
      but nothing came of it.&nbsp; He fled to Scotland afterwards, where his
      sister, who was young and beautiful, married the Scottish King.&nbsp;
      Edgar himself was not important enough for anybody to care much about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Christmas Day, William was crowned in Westminster Abbey, under the
      title of <span class="smcap">William the First</span>; but he is best
      known as <span class="smcap">William the Conqueror</span>.&nbsp; It was a
      strange coronation.&nbsp; One of the bishops who performed the ceremony
      asked the Normans, in French, if they would have Duke William for their
      king?&nbsp; They answered Yes.&nbsp; Another of the bishops put the same
      question to the Saxons, in English.&nbsp; They too answered Yes, with a
      loud shout.&nbsp; The noise being heard by a guard of Norman
      horse-soldiers outside, was mistaken for resistance on the part of the
      English.&nbsp; The guard instantly set fire to the neighbouring houses,
      and a tumult ensued; in the midst of which the King, being left alone in
      the Abbey, with a few priests (and they all being in a terrible fright
      together), was hurriedly crowned.&nbsp; When the crown was placed upon his
      head, he swore to govern the English as well as the best of their own
      monarchs.&nbsp; I dare say you think, as I do, that if we except the Great
      Alfred, he might pretty easily have done that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numbers of the English nobles had been killed in the last disastrous
      battle.&nbsp; Their estates, and the estates of all the nobles who had
      fought against him there, King William seized upon, and gave to his own
      Norman knights and nobles.&nbsp; Many great English families of the
      present time acquired their English lands in this way, and are very proud
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is got by force must be maintained by force.&nbsp; These nobles
      were obliged to build castles all over England, to defend their new
      property; and, do what he would, the King could neither soothe nor quell
      the nation as he wished.&nbsp; He gradually introduced the Norman language
      and the Norman customs; yet, for a long time the great body of the English
      remained sullen and revengeful.&nbsp; On his going over to Normandy, to
      visit his subjects there, the oppressions of his half-brother <span
      class="smcap">Odo</span>, whom he left in charge of his English kingdom,
      drove the people mad.&nbsp; The men of Kent even invited over, to take
      possession of Dover, their old enemy Count Eustace of Boulogne, who had
      led the fray when the Dover man was slain at his own fireside.&nbsp; The
      men of Hereford, aided by the Welsh, and commanded by a chief named <span
      class="smcap">Edric the Wild</span>, drove the Normans out of their
      country.&nbsp; Some of those who had been dispossessed of their lands,
      banded together in the North of England; some, in Scotland; some, in the
      thick woods and marshes; and whensoever they could fall upon the Normans,
      or upon the English who had submitted to the Normans, they fought,
      despoiled, and murdered, like the desperate outlaws that they were.&nbsp;
      Conspiracies were set on foot for a general massacre of the Normans, like
      the old massacre of the Danes.&nbsp; In short, the English were in a
      murderous mood all through the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      King William, fearing he might lose his conquest, came back, and tried to
      pacify the London people by soft words.&nbsp; He then set forth to repress
      the country people by stern deeds.&nbsp; Among the towns which he
      besieged, and where he killed and maimed the inhabitants without any
      distinction, sparing none, young or old, armed or unarmed, were Oxford,
      Warwick, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Lincoln, York.&nbsp; In all these
      places, and in many others, fire and sword worked their utmost horrors,
      and made the land dreadful to behold.&nbsp; The streams and rivers were
      discoloured with blood; the sky was blackened with smoke; the fields were
      wastes of ashes; the waysides were heaped up with dead.&nbsp; Such are the
      fatal results of conquest and ambition!&nbsp; Although William was a harsh
      and angry man, I do not suppose that he deliberately meant to work this
      shocking ruin, when he invaded England.&nbsp; But what he had got by the
      strong hand, he could only keep by the strong hand, and in so doing he
      made England a great grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two sons of Harold, by name <span class="smcap">Edmund</span> and <span
      class="smcap">Godwin</span>, came over from Ireland, with some ships,
      against the Normans, but were defeated.&nbsp; This was scarcely done, when
      the outlaws in the woods so harassed York, that the Governor sent to the
      King for help.&nbsp; The King despatched a general and a large force to
      occupy the town of Durham.&nbsp; The Bishop of that place met the general
      outside the town, and warned him not to enter, as he would be in danger
      there.&nbsp; The general cared nothing for the warning, and went in with
      all his men.&nbsp; That night, on every hill within sight of Durham,
      signal fires were seen to blaze.&nbsp; When the morning dawned, the
      English, who had assembled in great strength, forced the gates, rushed
      into the town, and slew the Normans every one.&nbsp; The English
      afterwards besought the Danes to come and help them.&nbsp; The Danes came,
      with two hundred and forty ships.&nbsp; The outlawed nobles joined them;
      they captured York, and drove the Normans out of that city.&nbsp; Then,
      William bribed the Danes to go away; and took such vengeance on the
      English, that all the former fire and sword, smoke and ashes, death and
      ruin, were nothing compared with it.&nbsp; In melancholy songs, and
      doleful stories, it was still sung and told by cottage fires on winter
      evenings, a hundred years afterwards, how, in those dreadful days of the
      Normans, there was not, from the River Humber to the River Tyne, one
      inhabited village left, nor one cultivated field&mdash;how there was
      nothing but a dismal ruin, where the human creatures and the beasts lay
      dead together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outlaws had, at this time, what they called a Camp of Refuge, in the
      midst of the fens of Cambridgeshire.&nbsp; Protected by those marshy
      grounds which were difficult of approach, they lay among the reeds and
      rushes, and were hidden by the mists that rose up from the watery earth.&nbsp;
      Now, there also was, at that time, over the sea in Flanders, an Englishman
      named <span class="smcap">Hereward</span>, whose father had died in his
      absence, and whose property had been given to a Norman.&nbsp; When he
      heard of this wrong that had been done him (from such of the exiled
      English as chanced to wander into that country), he longed for revenge;
      and joining the outlaws in their camp of refuge, became their commander.&nbsp;
      He was so good a soldier, that the Normans supposed him to be aided by
      enchantment.&nbsp; William, even after he had made a road three miles in
      length across the Cambridgeshire marshes, on purpose to attack this
      supposed enchanter, thought it necessary to engage an old lady, who
      pretended to be a sorceress, to come and do a little enchantment in the
      royal cause.&nbsp; For this purpose she was pushed on before the troops in
      a wooden tower; but Hereward very soon disposed of this unfortunate
      sorceress, by burning her, tower and all.&nbsp; The monks of the convent
      of Ely near at hand, however, who were fond of good living, and who found
      it very uncomfortable to have the country blockaded and their supplies of
      meat and drink cut off, showed the King a secret way of surprising the
      camp.&nbsp; So Hereward was soon defeated.&nbsp; Whether he afterwards
      died quietly, or whether he was killed after killing sixteen of the men
      who attacked him (as some old rhymes relate that he did), I cannot say.&nbsp;
      His defeat put an end to the Camp of Refuge; and, very soon afterwards,
      the King, victorious both in Scotland and in England, quelled the last
      rebellious English noble.&nbsp; He then surrounded himself with Norman
      lords, enriched by the property of English nobles; had a great survey made
      of all the land in England, which was entered as the property of its new
      owners, on a roll called Doomsday Book; obliged the people to put out
      their fires and candles at a certain hour every night, on the ringing of a
      bell which was called The Curfew; introduced the Norman dresses and
      manners; made the Normans masters everywhere, and the English, servants;
      turned out the English bishops, and put Normans in their places; and
      showed himself to be the Conqueror indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, even with his own Normans, he had a restless life.&nbsp; They were
      always hungering and thirsting for the riches of the English; and the more
      he gave, the more they wanted.&nbsp; His priests were as greedy as his
      soldiers.&nbsp; We know of only one Norman who plainly told his master,
      the King, that he had come with him to England to do his duty as a
      faithful servant, and that property taken by force from other men had no
      charms for him.&nbsp; His name was <span class="smcap">Guilbert</span>.&nbsp;
      We should not forget his name, for it is good to remember and to honour
      honest men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides all these troubles, William the Conqueror was troubled by quarrels
      among his sons.&nbsp; He had three living.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Robert</span>,
      called <span class="smcap">Curthose</span>, because of his short legs;
      <span class="smcap">William</span>, called <span class="smcap">Rufus</span>
      or the Red, from the colour of his hair; and <span class="smcap">Henry</span>,
      fond of learning, and called, in the Norman language, <span class="smcap">Beauclerc</span>,
      or Fine-Scholar.&nbsp; When Robert grew up, he asked of his father the
      government of Normandy, which he had nominally possessed, as a child,
      under his mother, <span class="smcap">Matilda</span>.&nbsp; The King
      refusing to grant it, Robert became jealous and discontented; and
      happening one day, while in this temper, to be ridiculed by his brothers,
      who threw water on him from a balcony as he was walking before the door,
      he drew his sword, rushed up-stairs, and was only prevented by the King
      himself from putting them to death.&nbsp; That same night, he hotly
      departed with some followers from his father&rsquo;s court, and
      endeavoured to take the Castle of Rouen by surprise.&nbsp; Failing in
      this, he shut himself up in another Castle in Normandy, which the King
      besieged, and where Robert one day unhorsed and nearly killed him without
      knowing who he was.&nbsp; His submission when he discovered his father,
      and the intercession of the queen and others, reconciled them; but not
      soundly; for Robert soon strayed abroad, and went from court to court with
      his complaints.&nbsp; He was a gay, careless, thoughtless fellow, spending
      all he got on musicians and dancers; but his mother loved him, and often,
      against the King&rsquo;s command, supplied him with money through a
      messenger named <span class="smcap">Samson</span>.&nbsp; At length the
      incensed King swore he would tear out Samson&rsquo;s eyes; and Samson,
      thinking that his only hope of safety was in becoming a monk, became one,
      went on such errands no more, and kept his eyes in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, from the turbulent day of his strange coronation, the
      Conqueror had been struggling, you see, at any cost of cruelty and
      bloodshed, to maintain what he had seized.&nbsp; All his reign, he
      struggled still, with the same object ever before him.&nbsp; He was a
      stern, bold man, and he succeeded in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved money, and was particular in his eating, but he had only leisure
      to indulge one other passion, and that was his love of hunting.&nbsp; He
      carried it to such a height that he ordered whole villages and towns to be
      swept away to make forests for the deer.&nbsp; Not satisfied with
      sixty-eight Royal Forests, he laid waste an immense district, to form
      another in Hampshire, called the New Forest.&nbsp; The many thousands of
      miserable peasants who saw their little houses pulled down, and themselves
      and children turned into the open country without a shelter, detested him
      for his merciless addition to their many sufferings; and when, in the
      twenty-first year of his reign (which proved to be the last), he went over
      to Rouen, England was as full of hatred against him, as if every leaf on
      every tree in all his Royal Forests had been a curse upon his head.&nbsp;
      In the New Forest, his son Richard (for he had four sons) had been gored
      to death by a Stag; and the people said that this so cruelly-made Forest
      would yet be fatal to others of the Conqueror&rsquo;s race.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was engaged in a dispute with the King of France about some territory.&nbsp;
      While he stayed at Rouen, negotiating with that King, he kept his bed and
      took medicines: being advised by his physicians to do so, on account of
      having grown to an unwieldy size.&nbsp; Word being brought to him that the
      King of France made light of this, and joked about it, he swore in a great
      rage that he should rue his jests.&nbsp; He assembled his army, marched
      into the disputed territory, burnt&mdash;his old way!&mdash;the vines, the
      crops, and fruit, and set the town of Mantes on fire.&nbsp; But, in an
      evil hour; for, as he rode over the hot ruins, his horse, setting his
      hoofs upon some burning embers, started, threw him forward against the
      pommel of the saddle, and gave him a mortal hurt.&nbsp; For six weeks he
      lay dying in a monastery near Rouen, and then made his will, giving
      England to William, Normandy to Robert, and five thousand pounds to Henry.&nbsp;
      And now, his violent deeds lay heavy on his mind.&nbsp; He ordered money
      to be given to many English churches and monasteries, and&mdash;which was
      much better repentance&mdash;released his prisoners of state, some of whom
      had been confined in his dungeons twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a September morning, and the sun was rising, when the King was
      awakened from slumber by the sound of a church bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
      bell is that?&rsquo; he faintly asked.&nbsp; They told him it was the bell
      of the chapel of Saint Mary.&nbsp; &lsquo;I commend my soul,&rsquo; said
      he, &lsquo;to Mary!&rsquo; and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of his name, The Conqueror, and then consider how he lay in death!&nbsp;
      The moment he was dead, his physicians, priests, and nobles, not knowing
      what contest for the throne might now take place, or what might happen in
      it, hastened away, each man for himself and his own property; the
      mercenary servants of the court began to rob and plunder; the body of the
      King, in the indecent strife, was rolled from the bed, and lay alone, for
      hours, upon the ground.&nbsp; O Conqueror, of whom so many great names are
      proud now, of whom so many great names thought nothing then, it were
      better to have conquered one true heart, than England!
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, the priests came creeping in with prayers and candles; and a
      good knight, named <span class="smcap">Herluin</span>, undertook (which no
      one else would do) to convey the body to Caen, in Normandy, in order that
      it might be buried in St. Stephen&rsquo;s church there, which the
      Conqueror had founded.&nbsp; But fire, of which he had made such bad use
      in his life, seemed to follow him of itself in death.&nbsp; A great
      conflagration broke out in the town when the body was placed in the
      church; and those present running out to extinguish the flames, it was
      once again left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not even buried in peace.&nbsp; It was about to be let down, in its
      Royal robes, into a tomb near the high altar, in presence of a great
      concourse of people, when a loud voice in the crowd cried out, &lsquo;This
      ground is mine!&nbsp; Upon it, stood my father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; This
      King despoiled me of both ground and house to build this church.&nbsp; In
      the great name of <span class="smcap">God</span>, I here forbid his body
      to be covered with the earth that is my right!&rsquo;&nbsp; The priests
      and bishops present, knowing the speaker&rsquo;s right, and knowing that
      the King had often denied him justice, paid him down sixty shillings for
      the grave.&nbsp; Even then, the corpse was not at rest.&nbsp; The tomb was
      too small, and they tried to force it in.&nbsp; It broke, a dreadful smell
      arose, the people hurried out into the air, and, for the third time, it
      was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the Conqueror&rsquo;s three sons, that they were not at their
      father&rsquo;s burial?&nbsp; Robert was lounging among minstrels, dancers,
      and gamesters, in France or Germany.&nbsp; Henry was carrying his five
      thousand pounds safely away in a convenient chest he had got made.&nbsp;
      William the Red was hurrying to England, to lay hands upon the Royal
      treasure and the crown.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE SECOND, CALLED RUFUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      William the Red, in breathless haste, secured the three great forts of
      Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings, and made with hot speed for Winchester,
      where the Royal treasure was kept.&nbsp; The treasurer delivering him the
      keys, he found that it amounted to sixty thousand pounds in silver,
      besides gold and jewels.&nbsp; Possessed of this wealth, he soon persuaded
      the Archbishop of Canterbury to crown him, and became William the Second,
      King of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus was no sooner on the throne, than he ordered into prison again the
      unhappy state captives whom his father had set free, and directed a
      goldsmith to ornament his father&rsquo;s tomb profusely with gold and
      silver.&nbsp; It would have been more dutiful in him to have attended the
      sick Conqueror when he was dying; but England itself, like this Red King,
      who once governed it, has sometimes made expensive tombs for dead men whom
      it treated shabbily when they were alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King&rsquo;s brother, Robert of Normandy, seeming quite content to be
      only Duke of that country; and the King&rsquo;s other brother,
      Fine-Scholar, being quiet enough with his five thousand pounds in a chest;
      the King flattered himself, we may suppose, with the hope of an easy
      reign.&nbsp; But easy reigns were difficult to have in those days.&nbsp;
      The turbulent Bishop <span class="smcap">Odo</span> (who had blessed the
      Norman army at the Battle of Hastings, and who, I dare say, took all the
      credit of the victory to himself) soon began, in concert with some
      powerful Norman nobles, to trouble the Red King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth seems to be that this bishop and his friends, who had lands in
      England and lands in Normandy, wished to hold both under one Sovereign;
      and greatly preferred a thoughtless good-natured person, such as Robert
      was, to Rufus; who, though far from being an amiable man in any respect,
      was keen, and not to be imposed upon.&nbsp; They declared in Robert&rsquo;s
      favour, and retired to their castles (those castles were very troublesome
      to kings) in a sullen humour.&nbsp; The Red King, seeing the Normans thus
      falling from him, revenged himself upon them by appealing to the English;
      to whom he made a variety of promises, which he never meant to perform&mdash;in
      particular, promises to soften the cruelty of the Forest Laws; and who, in
      return, so aided him with their valour, that <span class="smcap">Odo</span>
      was besieged in the Castle of Rochester, and forced to abandon it, and to
      depart from England for ever: whereupon the other rebellious Norman nobles
      were soon reduced and scattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the Red King went over to Normandy, where the people suffered
      greatly under the loose rule of Duke Robert.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s object
      was to seize upon the Duke&rsquo;s dominions.&nbsp; This, the Duke, of
      course, prepared to resist; and miserable war between the two brothers
      seemed inevitable, when the powerful nobles on both sides, who had seen so
      much of war, interfered to prevent it.&nbsp; A treaty was made.&nbsp; Each
      of the two brothers agreed to give up something of his claims, and that
      the longer-liver of the two should inherit all the dominions of the other.&nbsp;
      When they had come to this loving understanding, they embraced and joined
      their forces against Fine-Scholar; who had bought some territory of Robert
      with a part of his five thousand pounds, and was considered a dangerous
      individual in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, in Normandy (there is another St. Michael&rsquo;s
      Mount, in Cornwall, wonderfully like it), was then, as it is now, a strong
      place perched upon the top of a high rock, around which, when the tide is
      in, the sea flows, leaving no road to the mainland.&nbsp; In this place,
      Fine-Scholar shut himself up with his soldiers, and here he was closely
      besieged by his two brothers.&nbsp; At one time, when he was reduced to
      great distress for want of water, the generous Robert not only permitted
      his men to get water, but sent Fine-Scholar wine from his own table; and,
      on being remonstrated with by the Red King, said &lsquo;What! shall we let
      our own brother die of thirst?&nbsp; Where shall we get another, when he
      is gone?&rsquo;&nbsp; At another time, the Red King riding alone on the
      shore of the bay, looking up at the Castle, was taken by two of
      Fine-Scholar&rsquo;s men, one of whom was about to kill him, when he cried
      out, &lsquo;Hold, knave!&nbsp; I am the King of England!&rsquo;&nbsp; The
      story says that the soldier raised him from the ground respectfully and
      humbly, and that the King took him into his service.&nbsp; The story may
      or may not be true; but at any rate it is true that Fine-Scholar could not
      hold out against his united brothers, and that he abandoned Mount St.
      Michael, and wandered about&mdash;as poor and forlorn as other scholars
      have been sometimes known to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotch became unquiet in the Red King&rsquo;s time, and were twice
      defeated&mdash;the second time, with the loss of their King, Malcolm, and
      his son.&nbsp; The Welsh became unquiet too.&nbsp; Against them, Rufus was
      less successful; for they fought among their native mountains, and did
      great execution on the King&rsquo;s troops.&nbsp; Robert of Normandy
      became unquiet too; and, complaining that his brother the King did not
      faithfully perform his part of their agreement, took up arms, and obtained
      assistance from the King of France, whom Rufus, in the end, bought off
      with vast sums of money.&nbsp; England became unquiet too.&nbsp; Lord
      Mowbray, the powerful Earl of Northumberland, headed a great conspiracy to
      depose the King, and to place upon the throne, <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>,
      the Conqueror&rsquo;s near relative.&nbsp; The plot was discovered; all
      the chief conspirators were seized; some were fined, some were put in
      prison, some were put to death.&nbsp; The Earl of Northumberland himself
      was shut up in a dungeon beneath Windsor Castle, where he died, an old
      man, thirty long years afterwards.&nbsp; The Priests in England were more
      unquiet than any other class or power; for the Red King treated them with
      such small ceremony that he refused to appoint new bishops or archbishops
      when the old ones died, but kept all the wealth belonging to those offices
      in his own hands.&nbsp; In return for this, the Priests wrote his life
      when he was dead, and abused him well.&nbsp; I am inclined to think,
      myself, that there was little to choose between the Priests and the Red
      King; that both sides were greedy and designing; and that they were fairly
      matched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Red King was false of heart, selfish, covetous, and mean.&nbsp; He had
      a worthy minister in his favourite, Ralph, nicknamed&mdash;for almost
      every famous person had a nickname in those rough days&mdash;Flambard, or
      the Firebrand.&nbsp; Once, the King being ill, became penitent, and made
      <span class="smcap">Anselm</span>, a foreign priest and a good man,
      Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; But he no sooner got well again than he
      repented of his repentance, and persisted in wrongfully keeping to himself
      some of the wealth belonging to the archbishopric.&nbsp; This led to
      violent disputes, which were aggravated by there being in Rome at that
      time two rival Popes; each of whom declared he was the only real original
      infallible Pope, who couldn&rsquo;t make a mistake.&nbsp; At last, Anselm,
      knowing the Red King&rsquo;s character, and not feeling himself safe in
      England, asked leave to return abroad.&nbsp; The Red King gladly gave it;
      for he knew that as soon as Anselm was gone, he could begin to store up
      all the Canterbury money again, for his own use.
    </p>
    <p>
      By such means, and by taxing and oppressing the English people in every
      possible way, the Red King became very rich.&nbsp; When he wanted money
      for any purpose, he raised it by some means or other, and cared nothing
      for the injustice he did, or the misery he caused.&nbsp; Having the
      opportunity of buying from Robert the whole duchy of Normandy for five
      years, he taxed the English people more than ever, and made the very
      convents sell their plate and valuables to supply him with the means to
      make the purchase.&nbsp; But he was as quick and eager in putting down
      revolt as he was in raising money; for, a part of the Norman people
      objecting&mdash;very naturally, I think&mdash;to being sold in this way,
      he headed an army against them with all the speed and energy of his
      father.&nbsp; He was so impatient, that he embarked for Normandy in a
      great gale of wind.&nbsp; And when the sailors told him it was dangerous
      to go to sea in such angry weather, he replied, &lsquo;Hoist sail and
      away!&nbsp; Did you ever hear of a king who was drowned?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      You will wonder how it was that even the careless Robert came to sell his
      dominions.&nbsp; It happened thus.&nbsp; It had long been the custom for
      many English people to make journeys to Jerusalem, which were called
      pilgrimages, in order that they might pray beside the tomb of Our Saviour
      there.&nbsp; Jerusalem belonging to the Turks, and the Turks hating
      Christianity, these Christian travellers were often insulted and ill used.&nbsp;
      The Pilgrims bore it patiently for some time, but at length a remarkable
      man, of great earnestness and eloquence, called <span class="smcap">Peter
      the Hermit</span>, began to preach in various places against the Turks,
      and to declare that it was the duty of good Christians to drive away those
      unbelievers from the tomb of Our Saviour, and to take possession of it,
      and protect it.&nbsp; An excitement such as the world had never known
      before was created.&nbsp; Thousands and thousands of men of all ranks and
      conditions departed for Jerusalem to make war against the Turks.&nbsp; The
      war is called in history the first Crusade, and every Crusader wore a
      cross marked on his right shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Crusaders were not zealous Christians.&nbsp; Among them were vast
      numbers of the restless, idle, profligate, and adventurous spirit of the
      time.&nbsp; Some became Crusaders for the love of change; some, in the
      hope of plunder; some, because they had nothing to do at home; some,
      because they did what the priests told them; some, because they liked to
      see foreign countries; some, because they were fond of knocking men about,
      and would as soon knock a Turk about as a Christian.&nbsp; Robert of
      Normandy may have been influenced by all these motives; and by a kind
      desire, besides, to save the Christian Pilgrims from bad treatment in
      future.&nbsp; He wanted to raise a number of armed men, and to go to the
      Crusade.&nbsp; He could not do so without money.&nbsp; He had no money;
      and he sold his dominions to his brother, the Red King, for five years.&nbsp;
      With the large sum he thus obtained, he fitted out his Crusaders
      gallantly, and went away to Jerusalem in martial state.&nbsp; The Red
      King, who made money out of everything, stayed at home, busily squeezing
      more money out of Normans and English.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three years of great hardship and suffering&mdash;from shipwreck at
      sea; from travel in strange lands; from hunger, thirst, and fever, upon
      the burning sands of the desert; and from the fury of the Turks&mdash;the
      valiant Crusaders got possession of Our Saviour&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; The
      Turks were still resisting and fighting bravely, but this success
      increased the general desire in Europe to join the Crusade.&nbsp; Another
      great French Duke was proposing to sell his dominions for a term to the
      rich Red King, when the Red King&rsquo;s reign came to a sudden and
      violent end.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have not forgotten the New Forest which the Conqueror made, and which
      the miserable people whose homes he had laid waste, so hated.&nbsp; The
      cruelty of the Forest Laws, and the torture and death they brought upon
      the peasantry, increased this hatred.&nbsp; The poor persecuted country
      people believed that the New Forest was enchanted.&nbsp; They said that in
      thunder-storms, and on dark nights, demons appeared, moving beneath the
      branches of the gloomy trees.&nbsp; They said that a terrible spectre had
      foretold to Norman hunters that the Red King should be punished there.&nbsp;
      And now, in the pleasant season of May, when the Red King had reigned
      almost thirteen years; and a second Prince of the Conqueror&rsquo;s blood&mdash;another
      Richard, the son of Duke Robert&mdash;was killed by an arrow in this
      dreaded Forest; the people said that the second time was not the last, and
      that there was another death to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lonely forest, accursed in the people&rsquo;s hearts for the
      wicked deeds that had been done to make it; and no man save the King and
      his Courtiers and Huntsmen, liked to stray there.&nbsp; But, in reality,
      it was like any other forest.&nbsp; In the spring, the green leaves broke
      out of the buds; in the summer, flourished heartily, and made deep shades;
      in the winter, shrivelled and blew down, and lay in brown heaps on the
      moss.&nbsp; Some trees were stately, and grew high and strong; some had
      fallen of themselves; some were felled by the forester&rsquo;s axe; some
      were hollow, and the rabbits burrowed at their roots; some few were struck
      by lightning, and stood white and bare.&nbsp; There were hill-sides
      covered with rich fern, on which the morning dew so beautifully sparkled;
      there were brooks, where the deer went down to drink, or over which the
      whole herd bounded, flying from the arrows of the huntsmen; there were
      sunny glades, and solemn places where but little light came through the
      rustling leaves.&nbsp; The songs of the birds in the New Forest were
      pleasanter to hear than the shouts of fighting men outside; and even when
      the Red King and his Court came hunting through its solitudes, cursing
      loud and riding hard, with a jingling of stirrups and bridles and knives
      and daggers, they did much less harm there than among the English or
      Normans, and the stags died (as they lived) far easier than the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a day in August, the Red King, now reconciled to his brother,
      Fine-Scholar, came with a great train to hunt in the New Forest.&nbsp;
      Fine-Scholar was of the party.&nbsp; They were a merry party, and had lain
      all night at Malwood-Keep, a hunting-lodge in the forest, where they had
      made good cheer, both at supper and breakfast, and had drunk a deal of
      wine.&nbsp; The party dispersed in various directions, as the custom of
      hunters then was.&nbsp; The King took with him only <span class="smcap">Sir
      Walter Tyrrel</span>, who was a famous sportsman, and to whom he had
      given, before they mounted horse that morning, two fine arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time the King was ever seen alive, he was riding with Sir Walter
      Tyrrel, and their dogs were hunting together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost night, when a poor charcoal-burner, passing through the
      forest with his cart, came upon the solitary body of a dead man, shot with
      an arrow in the breast, and still bleeding.&nbsp; He got it into his cart.&nbsp;
      It was the body of the King.&nbsp; Shaken and tumbled, with its red beard
      all whitened with lime and clotted with blood, it was driven in the cart
      by the charcoal-burner next day to Winchester Cathedral, where it was
      received and buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Walter Tyrrel, who escaped to Normandy, and claimed the protection of
      the King of France, swore in France that the Red King was suddenly shot
      dead by an arrow from an unseen hand, while they were hunting together;
      that he was fearful of being suspected as the King&rsquo;s murderer; and
      that he instantly set spurs to his horse, and fled to the sea-shore.&nbsp;
      Others declared that the King and Sir Walter Tyrrel were hunting in
      company, a little before sunset, standing in bushes opposite one another,
      when a stag came between them.&nbsp; That the King drew his bow and took
      aim, but the string broke.&nbsp; That the King then cried, &lsquo;Shoot,
      Walter, in the Devil&rsquo;s name!&rsquo;&nbsp; That Sir Walter shot.&nbsp;
      That the arrow glanced against a tree, was turned aside from the stag, and
      struck the King from his horse, dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      By whose hand the Red King really fell, and whether that hand despatched
      the arrow to his breast by accident or by design, is only known to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Some think his brother may have caused him
      to be killed; but the Red King had made so many enemies, both among
      priests and people, that suspicion may reasonably rest upon a less
      unnatural murderer.&nbsp; Men know no more than that he was found dead in
      the New Forest, which the suffering people had regarded as a doomed ground
      for his race.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIRST, CALLED FINE-SCHOLAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fine-scholar, on hearing of the Red King&rsquo;s death, hurried to
      Winchester with as much speed as Rufus himself had made, to seize the
      Royal treasure.&nbsp; But the keeper of the treasure who had been one of
      the hunting-party in the Forest, made haste to Winchester too, and,
      arriving there at about the same time, refused to yield it up.&nbsp; Upon
      this, Fine-Scholar drew his sword, and threatened to kill the treasurer;
      who might have paid for his fidelity with his life, but that he knew
      longer resistance to be useless when he found the Prince supported by a
      company of powerful barons, who declared they were determined to make him
      King.&nbsp; The treasurer, therefore, gave up the money and jewels of the
      Crown: and on the third day after the death of the Red King, being a
      Sunday, Fine-Scholar stood before the high altar in Westminster Abbey, and
      made a solemn declaration that he would resign the Church property which
      his brother had seized; that he would do no wrong to the nobles; and that
      he would restore to the people the laws of Edward the Confessor, with all
      the improvements of William the Conqueror.&nbsp; So began the reign of
      <span class="smcap">King Henry the First</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people were attached to their new King, both because he had known
      distresses, and because he was an Englishman by birth and not a Norman.&nbsp;
      To strengthen this last hold upon them, the King wished to marry an
      English lady; and could think of no other wife than <span class="smcap">Maud
      the Good</span>, the daughter of the King of Scotland.&nbsp; Although this
      good Princess did not love the King, she was so affected by the
      representations the nobles made to her of the great charity it would be in
      her to unite the Norman and Saxon races, and prevent hatred and bloodshed
      between them for the future, that she consented to become his wife.&nbsp;
      After some disputing among the priests, who said that as she had been in a
      convent in her youth, and had worn the veil of a nun, she could not
      lawfully be married&mdash;against which the Princess stated that her aunt,
      with whom she had lived in her youth, had indeed sometimes thrown a piece
      of black stuff over her, but for no other reason than because the nun&rsquo;s
      veil was the only dress the conquering Normans respected in girl or woman,
      and not because she had taken the vows of a nun, which she never had&mdash;she
      was declared free to marry, and was made King Henry&rsquo;s Queen.&nbsp; A
      good Queen she was; beautiful, kind-hearted, and worthy of a better
      husband than the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he was a cunning and unscrupulous man, though firm and clever.&nbsp;
      He cared very little for his word, and took any means to gain his ends.&nbsp;
      All this is shown in his treatment of his brother Robert&mdash;Robert, who
      had suffered him to be refreshed with water, and who had sent him the wine
      from his own table, when he was shut up, with the crows flying below him,
      parched with thirst, in the castle on the top of St. Michael&rsquo;s
      Mount, where his Red brother would have let him die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the King began to deal with Robert, he removed and disgraced all
      the favourites of the late King; who were for the most part base
      characters, much detested by the people.&nbsp; Flambard, or Firebrand,
      whom the late King had made Bishop of Durham, of all things in the world,
      Henry imprisoned in the Tower; but Firebrand was a great joker and a jolly
      companion, and made himself so popular with his guards that they pretended
      to know nothing about a long rope that was sent into his prison at the
      bottom of a deep flagon of wine.&nbsp; The guards took the wine, and
      Firebrand took the rope; with which, when they were fast asleep, he let
      himself down from a window in the night, and so got cleverly aboard ship
      and away to Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Robert, when his brother Fine-Scholar came to the throne, was still
      absent in the Holy Land.&nbsp; Henry pretended that Robert had been made
      Sovereign of that country; and he had been away so long, that the ignorant
      people believed it.&nbsp; But, behold, when Henry had been some time King
      of England, Robert came home to Normandy; having leisurely returned from
      Jerusalem through Italy, in which beautiful country he had enjoyed himself
      very much, and had married a lady as beautiful as itself!&nbsp; In
      Normandy, he found Firebrand waiting to urge him to assert his claim to
      the English crown, and declare war against King Henry.&nbsp; This, after
      great loss of time in feasting and dancing with his beautiful Italian wife
      among his Norman friends, he at last did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English in general were on King Henry&rsquo;s side, though many of the
      Normans were on Robert&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But the English sailors deserted the
      King, and took a great part of the English fleet over to Normandy; so that
      Robert came to invade this country in no foreign vessels, but in English
      ships.&nbsp; The virtuous Anselm, however, whom Henry had invited back
      from abroad, and made Archbishop of Canterbury, was steadfast in the King&rsquo;s
      cause; and it was so well supported that the two armies, instead of
      fighting, made a peace.&nbsp; Poor Robert, who trusted anybody and
      everybody, readily trusted his brother, the King; and agreed to go home
      and receive a pension from England, on condition that all his followers
      were fully pardoned.&nbsp; This the King very faithfully promised, but
      Robert was no sooner gone than he began to punish them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them was the Earl of Shrewsbury, who, on being summoned by the King
      to answer to five-and-forty accusations, rode away to one of his strong
      castles, shut himself up therein, called around him his tenants and
      vassals, and fought for his liberty, but was defeated and banished.&nbsp;
      Robert, with all his faults, was so true to his word, that when he first
      heard of this nobleman having risen against his brother, he laid waste the
      Earl of Shrewsbury&rsquo;s estates in Normandy, to show the King that he
      would favour no breach of their treaty.&nbsp; Finding, on better
      information, afterwards, that the Earl&rsquo;s only crime was having been
      his friend, he came over to England, in his old thoughtless, warm-hearted
      way, to intercede with the King, and remind him of the solemn promise to
      pardon all his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confidence might have put the false King to the blush, but it did
      not.&nbsp; Pretending to be very friendly, he so surrounded his brother
      with spies and traps, that Robert, who was quite in his power, had nothing
      for it but to renounce his pension and escape while he could.&nbsp;
      Getting home to Normandy, and understanding the King better now, he
      naturally allied himself with his old friend the Earl of Shrewsbury, who
      had still thirty castles in that country.&nbsp; This was exactly what
      Henry wanted.&nbsp; He immediately declared that Robert had broken the
      treaty, and next year invaded Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pretended that he came to deliver the Normans, at their own request,
      from his brother&rsquo;s misrule.&nbsp; There is reason to fear that his
      misrule was bad enough; for his beautiful wife had died, leaving him with
      an infant son, and his court was again so careless, dissipated, and
      ill-regulated, that it was said he sometimes lay in bed of a day for want
      of clothes to put on&mdash;his attendants having stolen all his dresses.&nbsp;
      But he headed his army like a brave prince and a gallant soldier, though
      he had the misfortune to be taken prisoner by King Henry, with four
      hundred of his Knights.&nbsp; Among them was poor harmless Edgar Atheling,
      who loved Robert well.&nbsp; Edgar was not important enough to be severe
      with.&nbsp; The King afterwards gave him a small pension, which he lived
      upon and died upon, in peace, among the quiet woods and fields of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Robert&mdash;poor, kind, generous, wasteful, heedless Robert, with so
      many faults, and yet with virtues that might have made a better and a
      happier man&mdash;what was the end of him?&nbsp; If the King had had the
      magnanimity to say with a kind air, &lsquo;Brother, tell me, before these
      noblemen, that from this time you will be my faithful follower and friend,
      and never raise your hand against me or my forces more!&rsquo; he might
      have trusted Robert to the death.&nbsp; But the King was not a magnanimous
      man.&nbsp; He sentenced his brother to be confined for life in one of the
      Royal Castles.&nbsp; In the beginning of his imprisonment, he was allowed
      to ride out, guarded; but he one day broke away from his guard and
      galloped of.&nbsp; He had the evil fortune to ride into a swamp, where his
      horse stuck fast and he was taken.&nbsp; When the King heard of it he
      ordered him to be blinded, which was done by putting a red-hot metal basin
      on his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, in darkness and in prison, many years, he thought of all his past
      life, of the time he had wasted, of the treasure he had squandered, of the
      opportunities he had lost, of the youth he had thrown away, of the talents
      he had neglected.&nbsp; Sometimes, on fine autumn mornings, he would sit
      and think of the old hunting parties in the free Forest, where he had been
      the foremost and the gayest.&nbsp; Sometimes, in the still nights, he
      would wake, and mourn for the many nights that had stolen past him at the
      gaming-table; sometimes, would seem to hear, upon the melancholy wind, the
      old songs of the minstrels; sometimes, would dream, in his blindness, of
      the light and glitter of the Norman Court.&nbsp; Many and many a time, he
      groped back, in his fancy, to Jerusalem, where he had fought so well; or,
      at the head of his brave companions, bowed his feathered helmet to the
      shouts of welcome greeting him in Italy, and seemed again to walk among
      the sunny vineyards, or on the shore of the blue sea, with his lovely
      wife.&nbsp; And then, thinking of her grave, and of his fatherless boy, he
      would stretch out his solitary arms and weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, one day, there lay in prison, dead, with cruel and disfiguring
      scars upon his eyelids, bandaged from his jailer&rsquo;s sight, but on
      which the eternal Heavens looked down, a worn old man of eighty.&nbsp; He
      had once been Robert of Normandy.&nbsp; Pity him!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time when Robert of Normandy was taken prisoner by his brother,
      Robert&rsquo;s little son was only five years old.&nbsp; This child was
      taken, too, and carried before the King, sobbing and crying; for, young as
      he was, he knew he had good reason to be afraid of his Royal uncle.&nbsp;
      The King was not much accustomed to pity those who were in his power, but
      his cold heart seemed for the moment to soften towards the boy.&nbsp; He
      was observed to make a great effort, as if to prevent himself from being
      cruel, and ordered the child to be taken away; whereupon a certain Baron,
      who had married a daughter of Duke Robert&rsquo;s (by name, Helie of Saint
      Saen), took charge of him, tenderly.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s gentleness did
      not last long.&nbsp; Before two years were over, he sent messengers to
      this lord&rsquo;s Castle to seize the child and bring him away.&nbsp; The
      Baron was not there at the time, but his servants were faithful, and
      carried the boy off in his sleep and hid him.&nbsp; When the Baron came
      home, and was told what the King had done, he took the child abroad, and,
      leading him by the hand, went from King to King and from Court to Court,
      relating how the child had a claim to the throne of England, and how his
      uncle the King, knowing that he had that claim, would have murdered him,
      perhaps, but for his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth and innocence of the pretty little <span class="smcap">William
      Fitz-Robert</span> (for that was his name) made him many friends at that
      time.&nbsp; When he became a young man, the King of France, uniting with
      the French Counts of Anjou and Flanders, supported his cause against the
      King of England, and took many of the King&rsquo;s towns and castles in
      Normandy.&nbsp; But, King Henry, artful and cunning always, bribed some of
      William&rsquo;s friends with money, some with promises, some with power.&nbsp;
      He bought off the Count of Anjou, by promising to marry his eldest son,
      also named <span class="smcap">William</span>, to the Count&rsquo;s
      daughter; and indeed the whole trust of this King&rsquo;s life was in such
      bargains, and he believed (as many another King has done since, and as one
      King did in France a very little time ago) that every man&rsquo;s truth
      and honour can be bought at some price.&nbsp; For all this, he was so
      afraid of William Fitz-Robert and his friends, that, for a long time, he
      believed his life to be in danger; and never lay down to sleep, even in
      his palace surrounded by his guards, without having a sword and buckler at
      his bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      To strengthen his power, the King with great ceremony betrothed his eldest
      daughter <span class="smcap">Matilda</span>, then a child only eight years
      old, to be the wife of Henry the Fifth, the Emperor of Germany.&nbsp; To
      raise her marriage-portion, he taxed the English people in a most
      oppressive manner; then treated them to a great procession, to restore
      their good humour; and sent Matilda away, in fine state, with the German
      ambassadors, to be educated in the country of her future husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now his Queen, Maud the Good, unhappily died.&nbsp; It was a sad
      thought for that gentle lady, that the only hope with which she had
      married a man whom she had never loved&mdash;the hope of reconciling the
      Norman and English races&mdash;had failed.&nbsp; At the very time of her
      death, Normandy and all France was in arms against England; for, so soon
      as his last danger was over, King Henry had been false to all the French
      powers he had promised, bribed, and bought, and they had naturally united
      against him.&nbsp; After some fighting, however, in which few suffered but
      the unhappy common people (who always suffered, whatsoever was the
      matter), he began to promise, bribe, and buy again; and by those means,
      and by the help of the Pope, who exerted himself to save more bloodshed,
      and by solemnly declaring, over and over again, that he really was in
      earnest this time, and would keep his word, the King made peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first consequences of this peace was, that the King went over
      to Normandy with his son Prince William and a great retinue, to have the
      Prince acknowledged as his successor by the Norman Nobles, and to contract
      the promised marriage (this was one of the many promises the King had
      broken) between him and the daughter of the Count of Anjou.&nbsp; Both
      these things were triumphantly done, with great show and rejoicing; and on
      the twenty-fifth of November, in the year one thousand one hundred and
      twenty, the whole retinue prepared to embark at the Port of Barfleur, for
      the voyage home.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that day, and at that place, there came to the King, Fitz-Stephen, a
      sea-captain, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My liege, my father served your father all his life, upon the sea.&nbsp;
      He steered the ship with the golden boy upon the prow, in which your
      father sailed to conquer England.&nbsp; I beseech you to grant me the same
      office.&nbsp; I have a fair vessel in the harbour here, called The White
      Ship, manned by fifty sailors of renown.&nbsp; I pray you, Sire, to let
      your servant have the honour of steering you in The White Ship to England!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry, friend,&rsquo; replied the King, &lsquo;that my vessel
      is already chosen, and that I cannot (therefore) sail with the son of the
      man who served my father.&nbsp; But the Prince and all his company shall
      go along with you, in the fair White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors of
      renown.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or two afterwards, the King set sail in the vessel he had chosen,
      accompanied by other vessels, and, sailing all night with a fair and
      gentle wind, arrived upon the coast of England in the morning.&nbsp; While
      it was yet night, the people in some of those ships heard a faint wild cry
      come over the sea, and wondered what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Prince was a dissolute, debauched young man of eighteen, who bore
      no love to the English, and had declared that when he came to the throne
      he would yoke them to the plough like oxen.&nbsp; He went aboard The White
      Ship, with one hundred and forty youthful Nobles like himself, among whom
      were eighteen noble ladies of the highest rank.&nbsp; All this gay
      company, with their servants and the fifty sailors, made three hundred
      souls aboard the fair White Ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,&rsquo; said the Prince,
      &lsquo;to the fifty sailors of renown!&nbsp; My father the King has sailed
      out of the harbour.&nbsp; What time is there to make merry here, and yet
      reach England with the rest?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prince!&rsquo; said Fitz-Stephen, &lsquo;before morning, my fifty
      and The White Ship shall overtake the swiftest vessel in attendance on
      your father the King, if we sail at midnight!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Prince commanded to make merry; and the sailors drank out the
      three casks of wine; and the Prince and all the noble company danced in
      the moonlight on the deck of The White Ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at last, she shot out of the harbour of Barfleur, there was not a
      sober seaman on board.&nbsp; But the sails were all set, and the oars all
      going merrily.&nbsp; Fitz-Stephen had the helm.&nbsp; The gay young nobles
      and the beautiful ladies, wrapped in mantles of various bright colours to
      protect them from the cold, talked, laughed, and sang.&nbsp; The Prince
      encouraged the fifty sailors to row harder yet, for the honour of The
      White Ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crash!&nbsp; A terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts.&nbsp; It was
      the cry the people in the distant vessels of the King heard faintly on the
      water.&nbsp; The White Ship had struck upon a rock&mdash;was filling&mdash;going
      down!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitz-Stephen hurried the Prince into a boat, with some few Nobles.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;Push off,&rsquo; he whispered; &lsquo;and row to land.&nbsp; It is
      not far, and the sea is smooth.&nbsp; The rest of us must die.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as they rowed away, fast, from the sinking ship, the Prince heard the
      voice of his sister <span class="smcap">Marie</span>, the Countess of
      Perche, calling for help.&nbsp; He never in his life had been so good as
      he was then.&nbsp; He cried in an agony, &lsquo;Row back at any risk!&nbsp;
      I cannot bear to leave her!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They rowed back.&nbsp; As the Prince held out his arms to catch his
      sister, such numbers leaped in, that the boat was overset.&nbsp; And in
      the same instant The White Ship went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only two men floated.&nbsp; They both clung to the main yard of the ship,
      which had broken from the mast, and now supported them.&nbsp; One asked
      the other who he was?&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;I am a nobleman, <span
      class="smcap">Godfrey</span> by name, the son of <span class="smcap">Gilbert
      de l&rsquo;Aigle</span>.&nbsp; And you?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
      <span class="smcap">Berold</span>, a poor butcher of Rouen,&rsquo; was the
      answer.&nbsp; Then, they said together, &lsquo;Lord be merciful to us
      both!&rsquo; and tried to encourage one another, as they drifted in the
      cold benumbing sea on that unfortunate November night.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, another man came swimming towards them, whom they knew, when he
      pushed aside his long wet hair, to be Fitz-Stephen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is
      the Prince?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gone! Gone!&rsquo; the two cried
      together.&nbsp; &lsquo;Neither he, nor his brother, nor his sister, nor
      the King&rsquo;s niece, nor her brother, nor any one of all the brave
      three hundred, noble or commoner, except we three, has risen above the
      water!&rsquo;&nbsp; Fitz-Stephen, with a ghastly face, cried, &lsquo;Woe!
      woe, to me!&rsquo; and sunk to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two clung to the yard for some hours.&nbsp; At length the young
      noble said faintly, &lsquo;I am exhausted, and chilled with the cold, and
      can hold no longer.&nbsp; Farewell, good friend!&nbsp; God preserve you!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      So, he dropped and sunk; and of all the brilliant crowd, the poor Butcher
      of Rouen alone was saved.&nbsp; In the morning, some fishermen saw him
      floating in his sheep-skin coat, and got him into their boat&mdash;the
      sole relater of the dismal tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days, no one dared to carry the intelligence to the King.&nbsp;
      At length, they sent into his presence a little boy, who, weeping
      bitterly, and kneeling at his feet, told him that The White Ship was lost
      with all on board.&nbsp; The King fell to the ground like a dead man, and
      never, never afterwards, was seen to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he plotted again, and promised again, and bribed and bought again, in
      his old deceitful way.&nbsp; Having no son to succeed him, after all his
      pains (&lsquo;The Prince will never yoke us to the plough, now!&rsquo;
      said the English people), he took a second wife&mdash;<span class="smcap">Adelais</span>
      or <span class="smcap">Alice</span>, a duke&rsquo;s daughter, and the Pope&rsquo;s
      niece.&nbsp; Having no more children, however, he proposed to the Barons
      to swear that they would recognise as his successor, his daughter Matilda,
      whom, as she was now a widow, he married to the eldest son of the Count of
      Anjou, <span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>, surnamed <span class="smcap">Plantagenet</span>,
      from a custom he had of wearing a sprig of flowering broom (called Gen&ecirc;t
      in French) in his cap for a feather.&nbsp; As one false man usually makes
      many, and as a false King, in particular, is pretty certain to make a
      false Court, the Barons took the oath about the succession of Matilda (and
      her children after her), twice over, without in the least intending to
      keep it.&nbsp; The King was now relieved from any remaining fears of
      William Fitz-Robert, by his death in the Monastery of St. Omer, in France,
      at twenty-six years old, of a pike-wound in the hand.&nbsp; And as Matilda
      gave birth to three sons, he thought the succession to the throne secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent most of the latter part of his life, which was troubled by family
      quarrels, in Normandy, to be near Matilda.&nbsp; When he had reigned
      upward of thirty-five years, and was sixty-seven years old, he died of an
      indigestion and fever, brought on by eating, when he was far from well, of
      a fish called Lamprey, against which he had often been cautioned by his
      physicians.&nbsp; His remains were brought over to Reading Abbey to be
      buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may perhaps hear the cunning and promise-breaking of King Henry the
      First, called &lsquo;policy&rsquo; by some people, and &lsquo;diplomacy&rsquo;
      by others.&nbsp; Neither of these fine words will in the least mean that
      it was true; and nothing that is not true can possibly be good.
    </p>
    <p>
      His greatest merit, that I know of, was his love of learning&mdash;I
      should have given him greater credit even for that, if it had been strong
      enough to induce him to spare the eyes of a certain poet he once took
      prisoner, who was a knight besides.&nbsp; But he ordered the poet&rsquo;s
      eyes to be torn from his head, because he had laughed at him in his
      verses; and the poet, in the pain of that torture, dashed out his own
      brains against his prison wall.&nbsp; King Henry the First was avaricious,
      revengeful, and so false, that I suppose a man never lived whose word was
      less to be relied upon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER MATILDA AND STEPHEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The King was no sooner dead than all the plans and schemes he had laboured
      at so long, and lied so much for, crumbled away like a hollow heap of
      sand.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, whom he had never
      mistrusted or suspected, started up to claim the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen was the son of <span class="smcap">Adela</span>, the Conqueror&rsquo;s
      daughter, married to the Count of Blois.&nbsp; To Stephen, and to his
      brother <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, the late King had been liberal;
      making Henry Bishop of Winchester, and finding a good marriage for
      Stephen, and much enriching him.&nbsp; This did not prevent Stephen from
      hastily producing a false witness, a servant of the late King, to swear
      that the King had named him for his heir upon his death-bed.&nbsp; On this
      evidence the Archbishop of Canterbury crowned him.&nbsp; The new King, so
      suddenly made, lost not a moment in seizing the Royal treasure, and hiring
      foreign soldiers with some of it to protect his throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the dead King had even done as the false witness said, he would have
      had small right to will away the English people, like so many sheep or
      oxen, without their consent.&nbsp; But he had, in fact, bequeathed all his
      territory to Matilda; who, supported by <span class="smcap">Robert</span>,
      Earl of Gloucester, soon began to dispute the crown.&nbsp; Some of the
      powerful barons and priests took her side; some took Stephen&rsquo;s; all
      fortified their castles; and again the miserable English people were
      involved in war, from which they could never derive advantage whosoever
      was victorious, and in which all parties plundered, tortured, starved, and
      ruined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years had passed since the death of Henry the First&mdash;and during
      those five years there had been two terrible invasions by the people of
      Scotland under their King, David, who was at last defeated with all his
      army&mdash;when Matilda, attended by her brother Robert and a large force,
      appeared in England to maintain her claim.&nbsp; A battle was fought
      between her troops and King Stephen&rsquo;s at Lincoln; in which the King
      himself was taken prisoner, after bravely fighting until his battle-axe
      and sword were broken, and was carried into strict confinement at
      Gloucester.&nbsp; Matilda then submitted herself to the Priests, and the
      Priests crowned her Queen of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not long enjoy this dignity.&nbsp; The people of London had a
      great affection for Stephen; many of the Barons considered it degrading to
      be ruled by a woman; and the Queen&rsquo;s temper was so haughty that she
      made innumerable enemies.&nbsp; The people of London revolted; and, in
      alliance with the troops of Stephen, besieged her at Winchester, where
      they took her brother Robert prisoner, whom, as her best soldier and chief
      general, she was glad to exchange for Stephen himself, who thus regained
      his liberty.&nbsp; Then, the long war went on afresh.&nbsp; Once, she was
      pressed so hard in the Castle of Oxford, in the winter weather when the
      snow lay thick upon the ground, that her only chance of escape was to
      dress herself all in white, and, accompanied by no more than three
      faithful Knights, dressed in like manner that their figures might not be
      seen from Stephen&rsquo;s camp as they passed over the snow, to steal away
      on foot, cross the frozen Thames, walk a long distance, and at last gallop
      away on horseback.&nbsp; All this she did, but to no great purpose then;
      for her brother dying while the struggle was yet going on, she at last
      withdrew to Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two or three years after her withdrawal her cause appeared in England,
      afresh, in the person of her son Henry, young Plantagenet, who, at only
      eighteen years of age, was very powerful: not only on account of his
      mother having resigned all Normandy to him, but also from his having
      married <span class="smcap">Eleanor</span>, the divorced wife of the
      French King, a bad woman, who had great possessions in France.&nbsp;
      Louis, the French King, not relishing this arrangement, helped <span
      class="smcap">Eustace</span>, King Stephen&rsquo;s son, to invade
      Normandy: but Henry drove their united forces out of that country, and
      then returned here, to assist his partisans, whom the King was then
      besieging at Wallingford upon the Thames.&nbsp; Here, for two days,
      divided only by the river, the two armies lay encamped opposite to one
      another&mdash;on the eve, as it seemed to all men, of another desperate
      fight, when the <span class="smcap">Earl of Arundel</span> took heart and
      said &lsquo;that it was not reasonable to prolong the unspeakable miseries
      of two kingdoms to minister to the ambition of two princes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other noblemen repeating and supporting this when it was once
      uttered, Stephen and young Plantagenet went down, each to his own bank of
      the river, and held a conversation across it, in which they arranged a
      truce; very much to the dissatisfaction of Eustace, who swaggered away
      with some followers, and laid violent hands on the Abbey of St. Edmund&rsquo;s-Bury,
      where he presently died mad.&nbsp; The truce led to a solemn council at
      Winchester, in which it was agreed that Stephen should retain the crown,
      on condition of his declaring Henry his successor; that <span class="smcap">William</span>,
      another son of the King&rsquo;s, should inherit his father&rsquo;s
      rightful possessions; and that all the Crown lands which Stephen had given
      away should be recalled, and all the Castles he had permitted to be built
      demolished.&nbsp; Thus terminated the bitter war, which had now lasted
      fifteen years, and had again laid England waste.&nbsp; In the next year
      <span class="smcap">Stephen</span> died, after a troubled reign of
      nineteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although King Stephen was, for the time in which he lived, a humane and
      moderate man, with many excellent qualities; and although nothing worse is
      known of him than his usurpation of the Crown, which he probably excused
      to himself by the consideration that King Henry the First was a usurper
      too&mdash;which was no excuse at all; the people of England suffered more
      in these dread nineteen years, than at any former period even of their
      suffering history.&nbsp; In the division of the nobility between the two
      rival claimants of the Crown, and in the growth of what is called the
      Feudal System (which made the peasants the born vassals and mere slaves of
      the Barons), every Noble had his strong Castle, where he reigned the cruel
      king of all the neighbouring people.&nbsp; Accordingly, he perpetrated
      whatever cruelties he chose.&nbsp; And never were worse cruelties
      committed upon earth than in wretched England in those nineteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writers who were living then describe them fearfully.&nbsp; They say
      that the castles were filled with devils rather than with men; that the
      peasants, men and women, were put into dungeons for their gold and silver,
      were tortured with fire and smoke, were hung up by the thumbs, were hung
      up by the heels with great weights to their heads, were torn with jagged
      irons, killed with hunger, broken to death in narrow chests filled with
      sharp-pointed stones, murdered in countless fiendish ways.&nbsp; In
      England there was no corn, no meat, no cheese, no butter, there were no
      tilled lands, no harvests.&nbsp; Ashes of burnt towns, and dreary wastes,
      were all that the traveller, fearful of the robbers who prowled abroad at
      all hours, would see in a long day&rsquo;s journey; and from sunrise until
      night, he would not come upon a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergy sometimes suffered, and heavily too, from pillage, but many of
      them had castles of their own, and fought in helmet and armour like the
      barons, and drew lots with other fighting men for their share of booty.&nbsp;
      The Pope (or Bishop of Rome), on King Stephen&rsquo;s resisting his
      ambition, laid England under an Interdict at one period of this reign;
      which means that he allowed no service to be performed in the churches, no
      couples to be married, no bells to be rung, no dead bodies to be buried.&nbsp;
      Any man having the power to refuse these things, no matter whether he were
      called a Pope or a Poulterer, would, of course, have the power of
      afflicting numbers of innocent people.&nbsp; That nothing might be wanting
      to the miseries of King Stephen&rsquo;s time, the Pope threw in this
      contribution to the public store&mdash;not very like the widow&rsquo;s
      contribution, as I think, when Our Saviour sat in Jerusalem over-against
      the Treasury, &lsquo;and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SECOND
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PART THE FIRST
    </h3>
    <p>
      Henry Plantagenet, when he was but twenty-one years old, quietly succeeded
      to the throne of England, according to his agreement made with the late
      King at Winchester.&nbsp; Six weeks after Stephen&rsquo;s death, he and
      his Queen, Eleanor, were crowned in that city; into which they rode on
      horseback in great state, side by side, amidst much shouting and
      rejoicing, and clashing of music, and strewing of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reign of King Henry the Second began well.&nbsp; The King had great
      possessions, and (what with his own rights, and what with those of his
      wife) was lord of one-third part of France.&nbsp; He was a young man of
      vigour, ability, and resolution, and immediately applied himself to remove
      some of the evils which had arisen in the last unhappy reign.&nbsp; He
      revoked all the grants of land that had been hastily made, on either side,
      during the late struggles; he obliged numbers of disorderly soldiers to
      depart from England; he reclaimed all the castles belonging to the Crown;
      and he forced the wicked nobles to pull down their own castles, to the
      number of eleven hundred, in which such dismal cruelties had been
      inflicted on the people.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s brother, <span
      class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>, rose against him in France, while he was so
      well employed, and rendered it necessary for him to repair to that
      country; where, after he had subdued and made a friendly arrangement with
      his brother (who did not live long), his ambition to increase his
      possessions involved him in a war with the French King, Louis, with whom
      he had been on such friendly terms just before, that to the French King&rsquo;s
      infant daughter, then a baby in the cradle, he had promised one of his
      little sons in marriage, who was a child of five years old.&nbsp; However,
      the war came to nothing at last, and the Pope made the two Kings friends
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the clergy, in the troubles of the last reign, had gone on very ill
      indeed.&nbsp; There were all kinds of criminals among them&mdash;murderers,
      thieves, and vagabonds; and the worst of the matter was, that the good
      priests would not give up the bad priests to justice, when they committed
      crimes, but persisted in sheltering and defending them.&nbsp; The King,
      well knowing that there could be no peace or rest in England while such
      things lasted, resolved to reduce the power of the clergy; and, when he
      had reigned seven years, found (as he considered) a good opportunity for
      doing so, in the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
      will have for the new Archbishop,&rsquo; thought the King, &lsquo;a friend
      in whom I can trust, who will help me to humble these rebellious priests,
      and to have them dealt with, when they do wrong, as other men who do wrong
      are dealt with.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, he resolved to make his favourite, the
      new Archbishop; and this favourite was so extraordinary a man, and his
      story is so curious, that I must tell you all about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, a worthy merchant of London, named <span class="smcap">Gilbert
      &agrave; Becket</span>, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and was taken
      prisoner by a Saracen lord.&nbsp; This lord, who treated him kindly and
      not like a slave, had one fair daughter, who fell in love with the
      merchant; and who told him that she wanted to become a Christian, and was
      willing to marry him if they could fly to a Christian country.&nbsp; The
      merchant returned her love, until he found an opportunity to escape, when
      he did not trouble himself about the Saracen lady, but escaped with his
      servant Richard, who had been taken prisoner along with him, and arrived
      in England and forgot her.&nbsp; The Saracen lady, who was more loving
      than the merchant, left her father&rsquo;s house in disguise to follow
      him, and made her way, under many hardships, to the sea-shore.&nbsp; The
      merchant had taught her only two English words (for I suppose he must have
      learnt the Saracen tongue himself, and made love in that language), of
      which <span class="smcap">London</span> was one, and his own name, <span
      class="smcap">Gilbert</span>, the other.&nbsp; She went among the ships,
      saying, &lsquo;London! London!&rsquo; over and over again, until the
      sailors understood that she wanted to find an English vessel that would
      carry her there; so they showed her such a ship, and she paid for her
      passage with some of her jewels, and sailed away.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; The
      merchant was sitting in his counting-house in London one day, when he
      heard a great noise in the street; and presently Richard came running in
      from the warehouse, with his eyes wide open and his breath almost gone,
      saying, &lsquo;Master, master, here is the Saracen lady!&rsquo;&nbsp; The
      merchant thought Richard was mad; but Richard said, &lsquo;No, master!&nbsp;
      As I live, the Saracen lady is going up and down the city, calling
      Gilbert!&nbsp; Gilbert!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, he took the merchant by the
      sleeve, and pointed out of window; and there they saw her among the gables
      and water-spouts of the dark, dirty street, in her foreign dress, so
      forlorn, surrounded by a wondering crowd, and passing slowly along,
      calling Gilbert, Gilbert!&nbsp; When the merchant saw her, and thought of
      the tenderness she had shown him in his captivity, and of her constancy,
      his heart was moved, and he ran down into the street; and she saw him
      coming, and with a great cry fainted in his arms.&nbsp; They were married
      without loss of time, and Richard (who was an excellent man) danced with
      joy the whole day of the wedding; and they all lived happy ever
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      This merchant and this Saracen lady had one son, <span class="smcap">Thomas
      &agrave; Becket</span>.&nbsp; He it was who became the Favourite of King
      Henry the Second.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had become Chancellor, when the King thought of making him Archbishop.&nbsp;
      He was clever, gay, well educated, brave; had fought in several battles in
      France; had defeated a French knight in single combat, and brought his
      horse away as a token of the victory.&nbsp; He lived in a noble palace, he
      was the tutor of the young Prince Henry, he was served by one hundred and
      forty knights, his riches were immense.&nbsp; The King once sent him as
      his ambassador to France; and the French people, beholding in what state
      he travelled, cried out in the streets, &lsquo;How splendid must the King
      of England be, when this is only the Chancellor!&rsquo;&nbsp; They had
      good reason to wonder at the magnificence of Thomas &agrave; Becket, for,
      when he entered a French town, his procession was headed by two hundred
      and fifty singing boys; then, came his hounds in couples; then, eight
      waggons, each drawn by five horses driven by five drivers: two of the
      waggons filled with strong ale to be given away to the people; four, with
      his gold and silver plate and stately clothes; two, with the dresses of
      his numerous servants.&nbsp; Then, came twelve horses, each with a monkey
      on his back; then, a train of people bearing shields and leading fine
      war-horses splendidly equipped; then, falconers with hawks upon their
      wrists; then, a host of knights, and gentlemen and priests; then, the
      Chancellor with his brilliant garments flashing in the sun, and all the
      people capering and shouting with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was well pleased with all this, thinking that it only made
      himself the more magnificent to have so magnificent a favourite; but he
      sometimes jested with the Chancellor upon his splendour too.&nbsp; Once,
      when they were riding together through the streets of London in hard
      winter weather, they saw a shivering old man in rags.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at
      the poor object!&rsquo; said the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would it not be a
      charitable act to give that aged man a comfortable warm cloak?&rsquo;&nbsp;
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly it would,&rsquo; said Thomas &agrave; Becket, &lsquo;and
      you do well, Sir, to think of such Christian duties.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come!&rsquo;
      cried the King, &lsquo;then give him your cloak!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was made
      of rich crimson trimmed with ermine.&nbsp; The King tried to pull it off,
      the Chancellor tried to keep it on, both were near rolling from their
      saddles in the mud, when the Chancellor submitted, and the King gave the
      cloak to the old beggar: much to the beggar&rsquo;s astonishment, and much
      to the merriment of all the courtiers in attendance.&nbsp; For, courtiers
      are not only eager to laugh when the King laughs, but they really do enjoy
      a laugh against a Favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will make,&rsquo; thought King Henry the second, &lsquo;this
      Chancellor of mine, Thomas &agrave; Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp;
      He will then be the head of the Church, and, being devoted to me, will
      help me to correct the Church.&nbsp; He has always upheld my power against
      the power of the clergy, and once publicly told some bishops (I remember),
      that men of the Church were equally bound to me, with men of the sword.&nbsp;
      Thomas &agrave; Becket is the man, of all other men in England, to help me
      in my great design.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the King, regardless of all objection,
      either that he was a fighting man, or a lavish man, or a courtly man, or a
      man of pleasure, or anything but a likely man for the office, made him
      Archbishop accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Thomas &agrave; Becket was proud and loved to be famous.&nbsp; He was
      already famous for the pomp of his life, for his riches, his gold and
      silver plate, his waggons, horses, and attendants.&nbsp; He could do no
      more in that way than he had done; and being tired of that kind of fame
      (which is a very poor one), he longed to have his name celebrated for
      something else.&nbsp; Nothing, he knew, would render him so famous in the
      world, as the setting of his utmost power and ability against the utmost
      power and ability of the King.&nbsp; He resolved with the whole strength
      of his mind to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He may have had some secret grudge against the King besides.&nbsp; The
      King may have offended his proud humour at some time or other, for
      anything I know.&nbsp; I think it likely, because it is a common thing for
      Kings, Princes, and other great people, to try the tempers of their
      favourites rather severely.&nbsp; Even the little affair of the crimson
      cloak must have been anything but a pleasant one to a haughty man.&nbsp;
      Thomas &agrave; Becket knew better than any one in England what the King
      expected of him.&nbsp; In all his sumptuous life, he had never yet been in
      a position to disappoint the King.&nbsp; He could take up that proud stand
      now, as head of the Church; and he determined that it should be written in
      history, either that he subdued the King, or that the King subdued him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, of a sudden, he completely altered the whole manner of his life.&nbsp;
      He turned off all his brilliant followers, ate coarse food, drank bitter
      water, wore next his skin sackcloth covered with dirt and vermin (for it
      was then thought very religious to be very dirty), flogged his back to
      punish himself, lived chiefly in a little cell, washed the feet of
      thirteen poor people every day, and looked as miserable as he possibly
      could.&nbsp; If he had put twelve hundred monkeys on horseback instead of
      twelve, and had gone in procession with eight thousand waggons instead of
      eight, he could not have half astonished the people so much as by this
      great change.&nbsp; It soon caused him to be more talked about as an
      Archbishop than he had been as a Chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was very angry; and was made still more so, when the new
      Archbishop, claiming various estates from the nobles as being rightfully
      Church property, required the King himself, for the same reason, to give
      up Rochester Castle, and Rochester City too.&nbsp; Not satisfied with
      this, he declared that no power but himself should appoint a priest to any
      Church in the part of England over which he was Archbishop; and when a
      certain gentleman of Kent made such an appointment, as he claimed to have
      the right to do, Thomas &agrave; Becket excommunicated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excommunication was, next to the Interdict I told you of at the close of
      the last chapter, the great weapon of the clergy.&nbsp; It consisted in
      declaring the person who was excommunicated, an outcast from the Church
      and from all religious offices; and in cursing him all over, from the top
      of his head to the sole of his foot, whether he was standing up, lying
      down, sitting, kneeling, walking, running, hopping, jumping, gaping,
      coughing, sneezing, or whatever else he was doing.&nbsp; This unchristian
      nonsense would of course have made no sort of difference to the person
      cursed&mdash;who could say his prayers at home if he were shut out of
      church, and whom none but <span class="smcap">God</span> could judge&mdash;but
      for the fears and superstitions of the people, who avoided excommunicated
      persons, and made their lives unhappy.&nbsp; So, the King said to the New
      Archbishop, &lsquo;Take off this Excommunication from this gentleman of
      Kent.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which the Archbishop replied, &lsquo;I shall do no
      such thing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarrel went on.&nbsp; A priest in Worcestershire committed a most
      dreadful murder, that aroused the horror of the whole nation.&nbsp; The
      King demanded to have this wretch delivered up, to be tried in the same
      court and in the same way as any other murderer.&nbsp; The Archbishop
      refused, and kept him in the Bishop&rsquo;s prison.&nbsp; The King,
      holding a solemn assembly in Westminster Hall, demanded that in future all
      priests found guilty before their Bishops of crimes against the law of the
      land should be considered priests no longer, and should be delivered over
      to the law of the land for punishment.&nbsp; The Archbishop again refused.&nbsp;
      The King required to know whether the clergy would obey the ancient
      customs of the country?&nbsp; Every priest there, but one, said, after
      Thomas &agrave; Becket, &lsquo;Saving my order.&rsquo;&nbsp; This really
      meant that they would only obey those customs when they did not interfere
      with their own claims; and the King went out of the Hall in great wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the clergy began to be afraid, now, that they were going too far.&nbsp;
      Though Thomas &agrave; Becket was otherwise as unmoved as Westminster
      Hall, they prevailed upon him, for the sake of their fears, to go to the
      King at Woodstock, and promise to observe the ancient customs of the
      country, without saying anything about his order.&nbsp; The King received
      this submission favourably, and summoned a great council of the clergy to
      meet at the Castle of Clarendon, by Salisbury.&nbsp; But when the council
      met, the Archbishop again insisted on the words &lsquo;saying my order;&rsquo;
      and he still insisted, though lords entreated him, and priests wept before
      him and knelt to him, and an adjoining room was thrown open, filled with
      armed soldiers of the King, to threaten him.&nbsp; At length he gave way,
      for that time, and the ancient customs (which included what the King had
      demanded in vain) were stated in writing, and were signed and sealed by
      the chief of the clergy, and were called the Constitutions of Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarrel went on, for all that.&nbsp; The Archbishop tried to see the
      King.&nbsp; The King would not see him.&nbsp; The Archbishop tried to
      escape from England.&nbsp; The sailors on the coast would launch no boat
      to take him away.&nbsp; Then, he again resolved to do his worst in
      opposition to the King, and began openly to set the ancient customs at
      defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King summoned him before a great council at Northampton, where he
      accused him of high treason, and made a claim against him, which was not a
      just one, for an enormous sum of money.&nbsp; Thomas &agrave; Becket was
      alone against the whole assembly, and the very Bishops advised him to
      resign his office and abandon his contest with the King.&nbsp; His great
      anxiety and agitation stretched him on a sick-bed for two days, but he was
      still undaunted.&nbsp; He went to the adjourned council, carrying a great
      cross in his right hand, and sat down holding it erect before him.&nbsp;
      The King angrily retired into an inner room.&nbsp; The whole assembly
      angrily retired and left him there.&nbsp; But there he sat.&nbsp; The
      Bishops came out again in a body, and renounced him as a traitor.&nbsp; He
      only said, &lsquo;I hear!&rsquo; and sat there still.&nbsp; They retired
      again into the inner room, and his trial proceeded without him.&nbsp;
      By-and-by, the Earl of Leicester, heading the barons, came out to read his
      sentence.&nbsp; He refused to hear it, denied the power of the court, and
      said he would refer his cause to the Pope.&nbsp; As he walked out of the
      hall, with the cross in his hand, some of those present picked up rushes&mdash;rushes
      were strewn upon the floors in those days by way of carpet&mdash;and threw
      them at him.&nbsp; He proudly turned his head, and said that were he not
      Archbishop, he would chastise those cowards with the sword he had known
      how to use in bygone days.&nbsp; He then mounted his horse, and rode away,
      cheered and surrounded by the common people, to whom he threw open his
      house that night and gave a supper, supping with them himself.&nbsp; That
      same night he secretly departed from the town; and so, travelling by night
      and hiding by day, and calling himself &lsquo;Brother Dearman,&rsquo; got
      away, not without difficulty, to Flanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle still went on.&nbsp; The angry King took possession of the
      revenues of the archbishopric, and banished all the relations and servants
      of Thomas &agrave; Becket, to the number of four hundred.&nbsp; The Pope
      and the French King both protected him, and an abbey was assigned for his
      residence.&nbsp; Stimulated by this support, Thomas &agrave; Becket, on a
      great festival day, formally proceeded to a great church crowded with
      people, and going up into the pulpit publicly cursed and excommunicated
      all who had supported the Constitutions of Clarendon: mentioning many
      English noblemen by name, and not distantly hinting at the King of England
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When intelligence of this new affront was carried to the King in his
      chamber, his passion was so furious that he tore his clothes, and rolled
      like a madman on his bed of straw and rushes.&nbsp; But he was soon up and
      doing.&nbsp; He ordered all the ports and coasts of England to be narrowly
      watched, that no letters of Interdict might be brought into the kingdom;
      and sent messengers and bribes to the Pope&rsquo;s palace at Rome.&nbsp;
      Meanwhile, Thomas &agrave; Becket, for his part, was not idle at Rome, but
      constantly employed his utmost arts in his own behalf.&nbsp; Thus the
      contest stood, until there was peace between France and England (which had
      been for some time at war), and until the two children of the two Kings
      were married in celebration of it.&nbsp; Then, the French King brought
      about a meeting between Henry and his old favourite, so long his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then, though Thomas &agrave; Becket knelt before the King, he was
      obstinate and immovable as to those words about his order.&nbsp; King
      Louis of France was weak enough in his veneration for Thomas &agrave;
      Becket and such men, but this was a little too much for him.&nbsp; He said
      that &agrave; Becket &lsquo;wanted to be greater than the saints and
      better than St. Peter,&rsquo; and rode away from him with the King of
      England.&nbsp; His poor French Majesty asked &agrave; Becket&rsquo;s
      pardon for so doing, however, soon afterwards, and cut a very pitiful
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, and after a world of trouble, it came to this.&nbsp; There was
      another meeting on French ground between King Henry and Thomas &agrave;
      Becket, and it was agreed that Thomas &agrave; Becket should be Archbishop
      of Canterbury, according to the customs of former Archbishops, and that
      the King should put him in possession of the revenues of that post.&nbsp;
      And now, indeed, you might suppose the struggle at an end, and Thomas
      &agrave; Becket at rest.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">No</span>, not even
      yet.&nbsp; For Thomas &agrave; Becket hearing, by some means, that King
      Henry, when he was in dread of his kingdom being placed under an
      interdict, had had his eldest son Prince Henry secretly crowned, not only
      persuaded the Pope to suspend the Archbishop of York who had performed
      that ceremony, and to excommunicate the Bishops who had assisted at it,
      but sent a messenger of his own into England, in spite of all the King&rsquo;s
      precautions along the coast, who delivered the letters of excommunication
      into the Bishops&rsquo; own hands.&nbsp; Thomas &agrave; Becket then came
      over to England himself, after an absence of seven years.&nbsp; He was
      privately warned that it was dangerous to come, and that an ireful knight,
      named <span class="smcap">Ranulf de Broc</span>, had threatened that he
      should not live to eat a loaf of bread in England; but he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The common people received him well, and marched about with him in a
      soldierly way, armed with such rustic weapons as they could get.&nbsp; He
      tried to see the young prince who had once been his pupil, but was
      prevented.&nbsp; He hoped for some little support among the nobles and
      priests, but found none.&nbsp; He made the most of the peasants who
      attended him, and feasted them, and went from Canterbury to
      Harrow-on-the-Hill, and from Harrow-on-the-Hill back to Canterbury, and on
      Christmas Day preached in the Cathedral there, and told the people in his
      sermon that he had come to die among them, and that it was likely he would
      be murdered.&nbsp; He had no fear, however&mdash;or, if he had any, he had
      much more obstinacy&mdash;for he, then and there, excommunicated three of
      his enemies, of whom Ranulf de Broc, the ireful knight, was one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As men in general had no fancy for being cursed, in their sitting and
      walking, and gaping and sneezing, and all the rest of it, it was very
      natural in the persons so freely excommunicated to complain to the King.&nbsp;
      It was equally natural in the King, who had hoped that this troublesome
      opponent was at last quieted, to fall into a mighty rage when he heard of
      these new affronts; and, on the Archbishop of York telling him that he
      never could hope for rest while Thomas &agrave; Becket lived, to cry out
      hastily before his court, &lsquo;Have I no one here who will deliver me
      from this man?&rsquo;&nbsp; There were four knights present, who, hearing
      the King&rsquo;s words, looked at one another, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of these knights were <span class="smcap">Reginald Fitzurse</span>,
      <span class="smcap">William Tracy</span>, <span class="smcap">Hugh de
      Morville</span>, and <span class="smcap">Richard Brito</span>; three of
      whom had been in the train of Thomas &agrave; Becket in the old days of
      his splendour.&nbsp; They rode away on horseback, in a very secret manner,
      and on the third day after Christmas Day arrived at Saltwood House, not
      far from Canterbury, which belonged to the family of Ranulf de Broc.&nbsp;
      They quietly collected some followers here, in case they should need any;
      and proceeding to Canterbury, suddenly appeared (the four knights and
      twelve men) before the Archbishop, in his own house, at two o&rsquo;clock
      in the afternoon.&nbsp; They neither bowed nor spoke, but sat down on the
      floor in silence, staring at the Archbishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas &agrave; Becket said, at length, &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want,&rsquo; said Reginald Fitzurse, &lsquo;the excommunication
      taken from the Bishops, and you to answer for your offences to the King.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      Thomas &agrave; Becket defiantly replied, that the power of the clergy was
      above the power of the King.&nbsp; That it was not for such men as they
      were, to threaten him.&nbsp; That if he were threatened by all the swords
      in England, he would never yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then we will do more than threaten!&rsquo; said the knights.&nbsp;
      And they went out with the twelve men, and put on their armour, and drew
      their shining swords, and came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      His servants, in the meantime, had shut up and barred the great gate of
      the palace.&nbsp; At first, the knights tried to shatter it with their
      battle-axes; but, being shown a window by which they could enter, they let
      the gate alone, and climbed in that way.&nbsp; While they were battering
      at the door, the attendants of Thomas &agrave; Becket had implored him to
      take refuge in the Cathedral; in which, as a sanctuary or sacred place,
      they thought the knights would dare to do no violent deed.&nbsp; He told
      them, again and again, that he would not stir.&nbsp; Hearing the distant
      voices of the monks singing the evening service, however, he said it was
      now his duty to attend, and therefore, and for no other reason, he would
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a near way between his Palace and the Cathedral, by some
      beautiful old cloisters which you may yet see.&nbsp; He went into the
      Cathedral, without any hurry, and having the Cross carried before him as
      usual.&nbsp; When he was safely there, his servants would have fastened
      the door, but he said <span class="smcap">No</span>! it was the house of
      God and not a fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the shadow of Reginald Fitzurse appeared in the Cathedral
      doorway, darkening the little light there was outside, on the dark winter
      evening.&nbsp; This knight said, in a strong voice, &lsquo;Follow me,
      loyal servants of the King!&rsquo;&nbsp; The rattle of the armour of the
      other knights echoed through the Cathedral, as they came clashing in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so dark, in the lofty aisles and among the stately pillars of the
      church, and there were so many hiding-places in the crypt below and in the
      narrow passages above, that Thomas &agrave; Becket might even at that pass
      have saved himself if he would.&nbsp; But he would not.&nbsp; He told the
      monks resolutely that he would not.&nbsp; And though they all dispersed
      and left him there with no other follower than <span class="smcap">Edward
      Gryme</span>, his faithful cross-bearer, he was as firm then, as ever he
      had been in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knights came on, through the darkness, making a terrible noise with
      their armed tread upon the stone pavement of the church.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where
      is the traitor?&rsquo; they cried out.&nbsp; He made no answer.&nbsp; But
      when they cried, &lsquo;Where is the Archbishop?&rsquo; he said proudly,
      &lsquo;I am here!&rsquo; and came out of the shade and stood before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knights had no desire to kill him, if they could rid the King and
      themselves of him by any other means.&nbsp; They told him he must either
      fly or go with them.&nbsp; He said he would do neither; and he threw
      William Tracy off with such force when he took hold of his sleeve, that
      Tracy reeled again.&nbsp; By his reproaches and his steadiness, he so
      incensed them, and exasperated their fierce humour, that Reginald
      Fitzurse, whom he called by an ill name, said, &lsquo;Then die!&rsquo; and
      struck at his head.&nbsp; But the faithful Edward Gryme put out his arm,
      and there received the main force of the blow, so that it only made his
      master bleed.&nbsp; Another voice from among the knights again called to
      Thomas &agrave; Becket to fly; but, with his blood running down his face,
      and his hands clasped, and his head bent, he commanded himself to God, and
      stood firm.&nbsp; Then they cruelly killed him close to the altar of St.
      Bennet; and his body fell upon the pavement, which was dirtied with his
      blood and brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an awful thing to think of the murdered mortal, who had so showered
      his curses about, lying, all disfigured, in the church, where a few lamps
      here and there were but red specks on a pall of darkness; and to think of
      the guilty knights riding away on horseback, looking over their shoulders
      at the dim Cathedral, and remembering what they had left inside.
    </p>
    <h3>
      PART THE SECOND
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the King heard how Thomas &agrave; Becket had lost his life in
      Canterbury Cathedral, through the ferocity of the four Knights, he was
      filled with dismay.&nbsp; Some have supposed that when the King spoke
      those hasty words, &lsquo;Have I no one here who will deliver me from this
      man?&rsquo; he wished, and meant &agrave; Becket to be slain.&nbsp; But
      few things are more unlikely; for, besides that the King was not naturally
      cruel (though very passionate), he was wise, and must have known full well
      what any stupid man in his dominions must have known, namely, that such a
      murder would rouse the Pope and the whole Church against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent respectful messengers to the Pope, to represent his innocence
      (except in having uttered the hasty words); and he swore solemnly and
      publicly to his innocence, and contrived in time to make his peace.&nbsp;
      As to the four guilty Knights, who fled into Yorkshire, and never again
      dared to show themselves at Court, the Pope excommunicated them; and they
      lived miserably for some time, shunned by all their countrymen.&nbsp; At
      last, they went humbly to Jerusalem as a penance, and there died and were
      buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, fortunately for the pacifying of the Pope, that an
      opportunity arose very soon after the murder of &agrave; Becket, for the
      King to declare his power in Ireland&mdash;which was an acceptable
      undertaking to the Pope, as the Irish, who had been converted to
      Christianity by one Patricius (otherwise Saint Patrick) long ago, before
      any Pope existed, considered that the Pope had nothing at all to do with
      them, or they with the Pope, and accordingly refused to pay him Peter&rsquo;s
      Pence, or that tax of a penny a house which I have elsewhere mentioned.&nbsp;
      The King&rsquo;s opportunity arose in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irish were, at that time, as barbarous a people as you can well
      imagine.&nbsp; They were continually quarrelling and fighting, cutting one
      another&rsquo;s throats, slicing one another&rsquo;s noses, burning one
      another&rsquo;s houses, carrying away one another&rsquo;s wives, and
      committing all sorts of violence.&nbsp; The country was divided into five
      kingdoms&mdash;<span class="smcap">Desmond, Thomond</span>, <span
      class="smcap">Connaught</span>, <span class="smcap">Ulster</span>, and
      <span class="smcap">Leinster</span>&mdash;each governed by a separate
      King, of whom one claimed to be the chief of the rest.&nbsp; Now, one of
      these Kings, named <span class="smcap">Dermond Mac Murrough</span> (a wild
      kind of name, spelt in more than one wild kind of way), had carried off
      the wife of a friend of his, and concealed her on an island in a bog.&nbsp;
      The friend resenting this (though it was quite the custom of the country),
      complained to the chief King, and, with the chief King&rsquo;s help, drove
      Dermond Mac Murrough out of his dominions.&nbsp; Dermond came over to
      England for revenge; and offered to hold his realm as a vassal of King
      Henry, if King Henry would help him to regain it.&nbsp; The King consented
      to these terms; but only assisted him, then, with what were called Letters
      Patent, authorising any English subjects who were so disposed, to enter
      into his service, and aid his cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, at Bristol, a certain <span class="smcap">Earl Richard de Clare</span>,
      called <span class="smcap">Strongbow</span>; of no very good character;
      needy and desperate, and ready for anything that offered him a chance of
      improving his fortunes.&nbsp; There were, in South Wales, two other broken
      knights of the same good-for-nothing sort, called <span class="smcap">Robert
      Fitz-Stephen</span>, and <span class="smcap">Maurice Fitz-Gerald</span>.&nbsp;
      These three, each with a small band of followers, took up Dermond&rsquo;s
      cause; and it was agreed that if it proved successful, Strongbow should
      marry Dermond&rsquo;s daughter <span class="smcap">Eva</span>, and be
      declared his heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trained English followers of these knights were so superior in all the
      discipline of battle to the Irish, that they beat them against immense
      superiority of numbers.&nbsp; In one fight, early in the war, they cut off
      three hundred heads, and laid them before Mac Murrough; who turned them
      every one up with his hands, rejoicing, and, coming to one which was the
      head of a man whom he had much disliked, grasped it by the hair and ears,
      and tore off the nose and lips with his teeth.&nbsp; You may judge from
      this, what kind of a gentleman an Irish King in those times was.&nbsp; The
      captives, all through this war, were horribly treated; the victorious
      party making nothing of breaking their limbs, and casting them into the
      sea from the tops of high rocks.&nbsp; It was in the midst of the miseries
      and cruelties attendant on the taking of Waterford, where the dead lay
      piled in the streets, and the filthy gutters ran with blood, that
      Strongbow married Eva.&nbsp; An odious marriage-company those mounds of
      corpse&rsquo;s must have made, I think, and one quite worthy of the young
      lady&rsquo;s father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died, after Waterford and Dublin had been taken, and various successes
      achieved; and Strongbow became King of Leinster.&nbsp; Now came King Henry&rsquo;s
      opportunity.&nbsp; To restrain the growing power of Strongbow, he himself
      repaired to Dublin, as Strongbow&rsquo;s Royal Master, and deprived him of
      his kingdom, but confirmed him in the enjoyment of great possessions.&nbsp;
      The King, then, holding state in Dublin, received the homage of nearly all
      the Irish Kings and Chiefs, and so came home again with a great addition
      to his reputation as Lord of Ireland, and with a new claim on the favour
      of the Pope.&nbsp; And now, their reconciliation was completed&mdash;more
      easily and mildly by the Pope, than the King might have expected, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period of his reign, when his troubles seemed so few and his
      prospects so bright, those domestic miseries began which gradually made
      the King the most unhappy of men, reduced his great spirit, wore away his
      health, and broke his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had four sons.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, now aged
      eighteen&mdash;his secret crowning of whom had given such offence to
      Thomas &agrave; Becket.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Richard</span>, aged
      sixteen; <span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>, fifteen; and <span
      class="smcap">John</span>, his favourite, a young boy whom the courtiers
      named <span class="smcap">Lackland</span>, because he had no inheritance,
      but to whom the King meant to give the Lordship of Ireland.&nbsp; All
      these misguided boys, in their turn, were unnatural sons to him, and
      unnatural brothers to each other.&nbsp; Prince Henry, stimulated by the
      French King, and by his bad mother, Queen Eleanor, began the undutiful
      history,
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he demanded that his young wife, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>,
      the French King&rsquo;s daughter, should be crowned as well as he.&nbsp;
      His father, the King, consented, and it was done.&nbsp; It was no sooner
      done, than he demanded to have a part of his father&rsquo;s dominions,
      during his father&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; This being refused, he made off from
      his father in the night, with his bad heart full of bitterness, and took
      refuge at the French King&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; Within a day or two, his
      brothers Richard and Geoffrey followed.&nbsp; Their mother tried to join
      them&mdash;escaping in man&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;but she was seized by
      King Henry&rsquo;s men, and immured in prison, where she lay, deservedly,
      for sixteen years.&nbsp; Every day, however, some grasping English
      noblemen, to whom the King&rsquo;s protection of his people from their
      avarice and oppression had given offence, deserted him and joined the
      Princes.&nbsp; Every day he heard some fresh intelligence of the Princes
      levying armies against him; of Prince Henry&rsquo;s wearing a crown before
      his own ambassadors at the French Court, and being called the Junior King
      of England; of all the Princes swearing never to make peace with him,
      their father, without the consent and approval of the Barons of France.&nbsp;
      But, with his fortitude and energy unshaken, King Henry met the shock of
      these disasters with a resolved and cheerful face.&nbsp; He called upon
      all Royal fathers who had sons, to help him, for his cause was theirs; he
      hired, out of his riches, twenty thousand men to fight the false French
      King, who stirred his own blood against him; and he carried on the war
      with such vigour, that Louis soon proposed a conference to treat for
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference was held beneath an old wide-spreading green elm-tree, upon
      a plain in France.&nbsp; It led to nothing.&nbsp; The war recommenced.&nbsp;
      Prince Richard began his fighting career, by leading an army against his
      father; but his father beat him and his army back; and thousands of his
      men would have rued the day in which they fought in such a wicked cause,
      had not the King received news of an invasion of England by the Scots, and
      promptly come home through a great storm to repress it.&nbsp; And whether
      he really began to fear that he suffered these troubles because &agrave;
      Becket had been murdered; or whether he wished to rise in the favour of
      the Pope, who had now declared &agrave; Becket to be a saint, or in the
      favour of his own people, of whom many believed that even &agrave; Becket&rsquo;s
      senseless tomb could work miracles, I don&rsquo;t know: but the King no
      sooner landed in England than he went straight to Canterbury; and when he
      came within sight of the distant Cathedral, he dismounted from his horse,
      took off his shoes, and walked with bare and bleeding feet to &agrave;
      Becket&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; There, he lay down on the ground, lamenting,
      in the presence of many people; and by-and-by he went into the Chapter
      House, and, removing his clothes from his back and shoulders, submitted
      himself to be beaten with knotted cords (not beaten very hard, I dare say
      though) by eighty Priests, one after another.&nbsp; It chanced that on the
      very day when the King made this curious exhibition of himself, a complete
      victory was obtained over the Scots; which very much delighted the
      Priests, who said that it was won because of his great example of
      repentance.&nbsp; For the Priests in general had found out, since &agrave;
      Becket&rsquo;s death, that they admired him of all things&mdash;though
      they had hated him very cordially when he was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Flanders, who was at the head of the base conspiracy of the
      King&rsquo;s undutiful sons and their foreign friends, took the
      opportunity of the King being thus employed at home, to lay siege to
      Rouen, the capital of Normandy.&nbsp; But the King, who was
      extraordinarily quick and active in all his movements, was at Rouen, too,
      before it was supposed possible that he could have left England; and there
      he so defeated the said Earl of Flanders, that the conspirators proposed
      peace, and his bad sons Henry and Geoffrey submitted.&nbsp; Richard
      resisted for six weeks; but, being beaten out of castle after castle, he
      at last submitted too, and his father forgave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To forgive these unworthy princes was only to afford them breathing-time
      for new faithlessness.&nbsp; They were so false, disloyal, and
      dishonourable, that they were no more to be trusted than common thieves.&nbsp;
      In the very next year, Prince Henry rebelled again, and was again
      forgiven.&nbsp; In eight years more, Prince Richard rebelled against his
      elder brother; and Prince Geoffrey infamously said that the brothers could
      never agree well together, unless they were united against their father.&nbsp;
      In the very next year after their reconciliation by the King, Prince Henry
      again rebelled against his father; and again submitted, swearing to be
      true; and was again forgiven; and again rebelled with Geoffrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the end of this perfidious Prince was come.&nbsp; He fell sick at a
      French town; and his conscience terribly reproaching him with his
      baseness, he sent messengers to the King his father, imploring him to come
      and see him, and to forgive him for the last time on his bed of death.&nbsp;
      The generous King, who had a royal and forgiving mind towards his children
      always, would have gone; but this Prince had been so unnatural, that the
      noblemen about the King suspected treachery, and represented to him that
      he could not safely trust his life with such a traitor, though his own
      eldest son.&nbsp; Therefore the King sent him a ring from off his finger
      as a token of forgiveness; and when the Prince had kissed it, with much
      grief and many tears, and had confessed to those around him how bad, and
      wicked, and undutiful a son he had been; he said to the attendant Priests:
      &lsquo;O, tie a rope about my body, and draw me out of bed, and lay me
      down upon a bed of ashes, that I may die with prayers to God in a
      repentant manner!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he died, at twenty-seven years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years afterwards, Prince Geoffrey, being unhorsed at a tournament,
      had his brains trampled out by a crowd of horses passing over him.&nbsp;
      So, there only remained Prince Richard, and Prince John&mdash;who had
      grown to be a young man now, and had solemnly sworn to be faithful to his
      father.&nbsp; Richard soon rebelled again, encouraged by his friend the
      French King, <span class="smcap">Philip the Second</span> (son of Louis,
      who was dead); and soon submitted and was again forgiven, swearing on the
      New Testament never to rebel again; and in another year or so, rebelled
      again; and, in the presence of his father, knelt down on his knee before
      the King of France; and did the French King homage: and declared that with
      his aid he would possess himself, by force, of all his father&rsquo;s
      French dominions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet this Richard called himself a soldier of Our Saviour!&nbsp; And
      yet this Richard wore the Cross, which the Kings of France and England had
      both taken, in the previous year, at a brotherly meeting underneath the
      old wide-spreading elm-tree on the plain, when they had sworn (like him)
      to devote themselves to a new Crusade, for the love and honour of the
      Truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sick at heart, wearied out by the falsehood of his sons, and almost ready
      to lie down and die, the unhappy King who had so long stood firm, began to
      fail.&nbsp; But the Pope, to his honour, supported him; and obliged the
      French King and Richard, though successful in fight, to treat for peace.&nbsp;
      Richard wanted to be Crowned King of England, and pretended that he wanted
      to be married (which he really did not) to the French King&rsquo;s sister,
      his promised wife, whom King Henry detained in England.&nbsp; King Henry
      wanted, on the other hand, that the French King&rsquo;s sister should be
      married to his favourite son, John: the only one of his sons (he said) who
      had never rebelled against him.&nbsp; At last King Henry, deserted by his
      nobles one by one, distressed, exhausted, broken-hearted, consented to
      establish peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      One final heavy sorrow was reserved for him, even yet.&nbsp; When they
      brought him the proposed treaty of peace, in writing, as he lay very ill
      in bed, they brought him also the list of the deserters from their
      allegiance, whom he was required to pardon.&nbsp; The first name upon this
      list was John, his favourite son, in whom he had trusted to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O John! child of my heart!&rsquo; exclaimed the King, in a great
      agony of mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;O John, whom I have loved the best!&nbsp; O
      John, for whom I have contended through these many troubles!&nbsp; Have
      you betrayed me too!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he lay down with a heavy groan,
      and said, &lsquo;Now let the world go as it will.&nbsp; I care for nothing
      more!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, he told his attendants to take him to the French town of
      Chinon&mdash;a town he had been fond of, during many years.&nbsp; But he
      was fond of no place now; it was too true that he could care for nothing
      more upon this earth.&nbsp; He wildly cursed the hour when he was born,
      and cursed the children whom he left behind him; and expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, one hundred years before, the servile followers of the Court had
      abandoned the Conqueror in the hour of his death, so they now abandoned
      his descendant.&nbsp; The very body was stripped, in the plunder of the
      Royal chamber; and it was not easy to find the means of carrying it for
      burial to the abbey church of Fontevraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was said in after years, by way of flattery, to have the heart of
      a Lion.&nbsp; It would have been far better, I think, to have had the
      heart of a Man.&nbsp; His heart, whatever it was, had cause to beat
      remorsefully within his breast, when he came&mdash;as he did&mdash;into
      the solemn abbey, and looked on his dead father&rsquo;s uncovered face.&nbsp;
      His heart, whatever it was, had been a black and perjured heart, in all
      its dealings with the deceased King, and more deficient in a single touch
      of tenderness than any wild beast&rsquo;s in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a pretty story told of this Reign, called the story of <span
      class="smcap">Fair Rosamond</span>.&nbsp; It relates how the King doted on
      Fair Rosamond, who was the loveliest girl in all the world; and how he had
      a beautiful Bower built for her in a Park at Woodstock; and how it was
      erected in a labyrinth, and could only be found by a clue of silk.&nbsp;
      How the bad Queen Eleanor, becoming jealous of Fair Rosamond, found out
      the secret of the clue, and one day, appeared before her, with a dagger
      and a cup of poison, and left her to the choice between those deaths.&nbsp;
      How Fair Rosamond, after shedding many piteous tears and offering many
      useless prayers to the cruel Queen, took the poison, and fell dead in the
      midst of the beautiful bower, while the unconscious birds sang gaily all
      around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there <i>was</i> a fair Rosamond, and she was (I dare say) the
      loveliest girl in all the world, and the King was certainly very fond of
      her, and the bad Queen Eleanor was certainly made jealous.&nbsp; But I am
      afraid&mdash;I say afraid, because I like the story so much&mdash;that
      there was no bower, no labyrinth, no silken clue, no dagger, no poison.&nbsp;
      I am afraid fair Rosamond retired to a nunnery near Oxford, and died
      there, peaceably; her sister-nuns hanging a silken drapery over her tomb,
      and often dressing it with flowers, in remembrance of the youth and beauty
      that had enchanted the King when he too was young, and when his life lay
      fair before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark and ended now; faded and gone.&nbsp; Henry Plantagenet lay
      quiet in the abbey church of Fontevraud, in the fifty-seventh year of his
      age&mdash;never to be completed&mdash;after governing England well, for
      nearly thirty-five years.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE FIRST, CALLED THE LION-HEART
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine, Richard
      of the Lion Heart succeeded to the throne of King Henry the Second, whose
      paternal heart he had done so much to break.&nbsp; He had been, as we have
      seen, a rebel from his boyhood; but, the moment he became a king against
      whom others might rebel, he found out that rebellion was a great
      wickedness.&nbsp; In the heat of this pious discovery, he punished all the
      leading people who had befriended him against his father.&nbsp; He could
      scarcely have done anything that would have been a better instance of his
      real nature, or a better warning to fawners and parasites not to trust in
      lion-hearted princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He likewise put his late father&rsquo;s treasurer in chains, and locked
      him up in a dungeon from which he was not set free until he had
      relinquished, not only all the Crown treasure, but all his own money too.&nbsp;
      So, Richard certainly got the Lion&rsquo;s share of the wealth of this
      wretched treasurer, whether he had a Lion&rsquo;s heart or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was crowned King of England, with great pomp, at Westminster: walking
      to the Cathedral under a silken canopy stretched on the tops of four
      lances, each carried by a great lord.&nbsp; On the day of his coronation,
      a dreadful murdering of the Jews took place, which seems to have given
      great delight to numbers of savage persons calling themselves Christians.&nbsp;
      The King had issued a proclamation forbidding the Jews (who were generally
      hated, though they were the most useful merchants in England) to appear at
      the ceremony; but as they had assembled in London from all parts, bringing
      presents to show their respect for the new Sovereign, some of them
      ventured down to Westminster Hall with their gifts; which were very
      readily accepted.&nbsp; It is supposed, now, that some noisy fellow in the
      crowd, pretending to be a very delicate Christian, set up a howl at this,
      and struck a Jew who was trying to get in at the Hall door with his
      present.&nbsp; A riot arose.&nbsp; The Jews who had got into the Hall,
      were driven forth; and some of the rabble cried out that the new King had
      commanded the unbelieving race to be put to death.&nbsp; Thereupon the
      crowd rushed through the narrow streets of the city, slaughtering all the
      Jews they met; and when they could find no more out of doors (on account
      of their having fled to their houses, and fastened themselves in), they
      ran madly about, breaking open all the houses where the Jews lived,
      rushing in and stabbing or spearing them, sometimes even flinging old
      people and children out of window into blazing fires they had lighted up
      below.&nbsp; This great cruelty lasted four-and-twenty hours, and only
      three men were punished for it.&nbsp; Even they forfeited their lives not
      for murdering and robbing the Jews, but for burning the houses of some
      Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Richard, who was a strong, restless, burly man, with one idea always
      in his head, and that the very troublesome idea of breaking the heads of
      other men, was mightily impatient to go on a Crusade to the Holy Land,
      with a great army.&nbsp; As great armies could not be raised to go, even
      to the Holy Land, without a great deal of money, he sold the Crown
      domains, and even the high offices of State; recklessly appointing
      noblemen to rule over his English subjects, not because they were fit to
      govern, but because they could pay high for the privilege.&nbsp; In this
      way, and by selling pardons at a dear rate and by varieties of avarice and
      oppression, he scraped together a large treasure.&nbsp; He then appointed
      two Bishops to take care of his kingdom in his absence, and gave great
      powers and possessions to his brother John, to secure his friendship.&nbsp;
      John would rather have been made Regent of England; but he was a sly man,
      and friendly to the expedition; saying to himself, no doubt, &lsquo;The
      more fighting, the more chance of my brother being killed; and when he <i>is</i>
      killed, then I become King John!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the newly levied army departed from England, the recruits and the
      general populace distinguished themselves by astonishing cruelties on the
      unfortunate Jews: whom, in many large towns, they murdered by hundreds in
      the most horrible manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At York, a large body of Jews took refuge in the Castle, in the absence of
      its Governor, after the wives and children of many of them had been slain
      before their eyes.&nbsp; Presently came the Governor, and demanded
      admission.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can we give it thee, O Governor!&rsquo; said
      the Jews upon the walls, &lsquo;when, if we open the gate by so much as
      the width of a foot, the roaring crowd behind thee will press in and kill
      us?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the unjust Governor became angry, and told the people that he
      approved of their killing those Jews; and a mischievous maniac of a friar,
      dressed all in white, put himself at the head of the assault, and they
      assaulted the Castle for three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said <span class="smcap">Jocen</span>, the head-Jew (who was a Rabbi
      or Priest), to the rest, &lsquo;Brethren, there is no hope for us with the
      Christians who are hammering at the gates and walls, and who must soon
      break in.&nbsp; As we and our wives and children must die, either by
      Christian hands, or by our own, let it be by our own.&nbsp; Let us destroy
      by fire what jewels and other treasure we have here, then fire the castle,
      and then perish!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few could not resolve to do this, but the greater part complied.&nbsp;
      They made a blazing heap of all their valuables, and, when those were
      consumed, set the castle in flames.&nbsp; While the flames roared and
      crackled around them, and shooting up into the sky, turned it blood-red,
      Jocen cut the throat of his beloved wife, and stabbed himself.&nbsp; All
      the others who had wives or children, did the like dreadful deed.&nbsp;
      When the populace broke in, they found (except the trembling few, cowering
      in corners, whom they soon killed) only heaps of greasy cinders, with here
      and there something like part of the blackened trunk of a burnt tree, but
      which had lately been a human creature, formed by the beneficent hand of
      the Creator as they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this bad beginning, Richard and his troops went on, in no very good
      manner, with the Holy Crusade.&nbsp; It was undertaken jointly by the King
      of England and his old friend Philip of France.&nbsp; They commenced the
      business by reviewing their forces, to the number of one hundred thousand
      men.&nbsp; Afterwards, they severally embarked their troops for Messina,
      in Sicily, which was appointed as the next place of meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Richard&rsquo;s sister had married the King of this place, but he was
      dead: and his uncle <span class="smcap">Tancred</span> had usurped the
      crown, cast the Royal Widow into prison, and possessed himself of her
      estates.&nbsp; Richard fiercely demanded his sister&rsquo;s release, the
      restoration of her lands, and (according to the Royal custom of the
      Island) that she should have a golden chair, a golden table,
      four-and-twenty silver cups, and four-and-twenty silver dishes.&nbsp; As
      he was too powerful to be successfully resisted, Tancred yielded to his
      demands; and then the French King grew jealous, and complained that the
      English King wanted to be absolute in the Island of Messina and everywhere
      else.&nbsp; Richard, however, cared little or nothing for this complaint;
      and in consideration of a present of twenty thousand pieces of gold,
      promised his pretty little nephew <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, then
      a child of two years old, in marriage to Tancred&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
      We shall hear again of pretty little Arthur by-and-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Sicilian affair arranged without anybody&rsquo;s brains being knocked
      out (which must have rather disappointed him), King Richard took his
      sister away, and also a fair lady named <span class="smcap">Berengaria</span>,
      with whom he had fallen in love in France, and whom his mother, Queen
      Eleanor (so long in prison, you remember, but released by Richard on his
      coming to the Throne), had brought out there to be his wife; and sailed
      with them for Cyprus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon had the pleasure of fighting the King of the Island of Cyprus, for
      allowing his subjects to pillage some of the English troops who were
      shipwrecked on the shore; and easily conquering this poor monarch, he
      seized his only daughter, to be a companion to the lady Berengaria, and
      put the King himself into silver fetters.&nbsp; He then sailed away again
      with his mother, sister, wife, and the captive princess; and soon arrived
      before the town of Acre, which the French King with his fleet was
      besieging from the sea.&nbsp; But the French King was in no triumphant
      condition, for his army had been thinned by the swords of the Saracens,
      and wasted by the plague; and <span class="smcap">Saladin</span>, the
      brave Sultan of the Turks, at the head of a numerous army, was at that
      time gallantly defending the place from the hills that rise above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever the united army of Crusaders went, they agreed in few points
      except in gaming, drinking, and quarrelling, in a most unholy manner; in
      debauching the people among whom they tarried, whether they were friends
      or foes; and in carrying disturbance and ruin into quiet places.&nbsp; The
      French King was jealous of the English King, and the English King was
      jealous of the French King, and the disorderly and violent soldiers of the
      two nations were jealous of one another; consequently, the two Kings could
      not at first agree, even upon a joint assault on Acre; but when they did
      make up their quarrel for that purpose, the Saracens promised to yield the
      town, to give up to the Christians the wood of the Holy Cross, to set at
      liberty all their Christian captives, and to pay two hundred thousand
      pieces of gold.&nbsp; All this was to be done within forty days; but, not
      being done, King Richard ordered some three thousand Saracen prisoners to
      be brought out in the front of his camp, and there, in full view of their
      own countrymen, to be butchered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French King had no part in this crime; for he was by that time
      travelling homeward with the greater part of his men; being offended by
      the overbearing conduct of the English King; being anxious to look after
      his own dominions; and being ill, besides, from the unwholesome air of
      that hot and sandy country.&nbsp; King Richard carried on the war without
      him; and remained in the East, meeting with a variety of adventures,
      nearly a year and a half.&nbsp; Every night when his army was on the
      march, and came to a halt, the heralds cried out three times, to remind
      all the soldiers of the cause in which they were engaged, &lsquo;Save the
      Holy Sepulchre!&rsquo; and then all the soldiers knelt and said &lsquo;Amen!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      Marching or encamping, the army had continually to strive with the hot air
      of the glaring desert, or with the Saracen soldiers animated and directed
      by the brave Saladin, or with both together.&nbsp; Sickness and death,
      battle and wounds, were always among them; but through every difficulty
      King Richard fought like a giant, and worked like a common labourer.&nbsp;
      Long and long after he was quiet in his grave, his terrible battle-axe,
      with twenty English pounds of English steel in its mighty head, was a
      legend among the Saracens; and when all the Saracen and Christian hosts
      had been dust for many a year, if a Saracen horse started at any object by
      the wayside, his rider would exclaim, &lsquo;What dost thou fear, Fool?&nbsp;
      Dost thou think King Richard is behind it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No one admired this King&rsquo;s renown for bravery more than Saladin
      himself, who was a generous and gallant enemy.&nbsp; When Richard lay ill
      of a fever, Saladin sent him fresh fruits from Damascus, and snow from the
      mountain-tops.&nbsp; Courtly messages and compliments were frequently
      exchanged between them&mdash;and then King Richard would mount his horse
      and kill as many Saracens as he could; and Saladin would mount his, and
      kill as many Christians as he could.&nbsp; In this way King Richard fought
      to his heart&rsquo;s content at Arsoof and at Jaffa; and finding himself
      with nothing exciting to do at Ascalon, except to rebuild, for his own
      defence, some fortifications there which the Saracens had destroyed, he
      kicked his ally the Duke of Austria, for being too proud to work at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The army at last came within sight of the Holy City of Jerusalem; but,
      being then a mere nest of jealousy, and quarrelling and fighting, soon
      retired, and agreed with the Saracens upon a truce for three years, three
      months, three days, and three hours.&nbsp; Then, the English Christians,
      protected by the noble Saladin from Saracen revenge, visited Our Saviour&rsquo;s
      tomb; and then King Richard embarked with a small force at Acre to return
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea, and was fain to pass through
      Germany, under an assumed name.&nbsp; Now, there were many people in
      Germany who had served in the Holy Land under that proud Duke of Austria
      who had been kicked; and some of them, easily recognising a man so
      remarkable as King Richard, carried their intelligence to the kicked Duke,
      who straightway took him prisoner at a little inn near Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke&rsquo;s master the Emperor of Germany, and the King of France,
      were equally delighted to have so troublesome a monarch in safe keeping.&nbsp;
      Friendships which are founded on a partnership in doing wrong, are never
      true; and the King of France was now quite as heartily King Richard&rsquo;s
      foe, as he had ever been his friend in his unnatural conduct to his
      father.&nbsp; He monstrously pretended that King Richard had designed to
      poison him in the East; he charged him with having murdered, there, a man
      whom he had in truth befriended; he bribed the Emperor of Germany to keep
      him close prisoner; and, finally, through the plotting of these two
      princes, Richard was brought before the German legislature, charged with
      the foregoing crimes, and many others.&nbsp; But he defended himself so
      well, that many of the assembly were moved to tears by his eloquence and
      earnestness.&nbsp; It was decided that he should be treated, during the
      rest of his captivity, in a manner more becoming his dignity than he had
      been, and that he should be set free on the payment of a heavy ransom.&nbsp;
      This ransom the English people willingly raised.&nbsp; When Queen Eleanor
      took it over to Germany, it was at first evaded and refused.&nbsp; But she
      appealed to the honour of all the princes of the German Empire in behalf
      of her son, and appealed so well that it was accepted, and the King
      released.&nbsp; Thereupon, the King of France wrote to Prince John&mdash;&lsquo;Take
      care of thyself.&nbsp; The devil is unchained!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince John had reason to fear his brother, for he had been a traitor to
      him in his captivity.&nbsp; He had secretly joined the French King; had
      vowed to the English nobles and people that his brother was dead; and had
      vainly tried to seize the crown.&nbsp; He was now in France, at a place
      called Evreux.&nbsp; Being the meanest and basest of men, he contrived a
      mean and base expedient for making himself acceptable to his brother.&nbsp;
      He invited the French officers of the garrison in that town to dinner,
      murdered them all, and then took the fortress.&nbsp; With this
      recommendation to the good will of a lion-hearted monarch, he hastened to
      King Richard, fell on his knees before him, and obtained the intercession
      of Queen Eleanor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I forgive him,&rsquo; said the King,
      &lsquo;and I hope I may forget the injury he has done me, as easily as I
      know he will forget my pardon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While King Richard was in Sicily, there had been trouble in his dominions
      at home: one of the bishops whom he had left in charge thereof, arresting
      the other; and making, in his pride and ambition, as great a show as if he
      were King himself.&nbsp; But the King hearing of it at Messina, and
      appointing a new Regency, this <span class="smcap">Longchamp</span> (for
      that was his name) had fled to France in a woman&rsquo;s dress, and had
      there been encouraged and supported by the French King.&nbsp; With all
      these causes of offence against Philip in his mind, King Richard had no
      sooner been welcomed home by his enthusiastic subjects with great display
      and splendour, and had no sooner been crowned afresh at Winchester, than
      he resolved to show the French King that the Devil was unchained indeed,
      and made war against him with great fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was fresh trouble at home about this time, arising out of the
      discontents of the poor people, who complained that they were far more
      heavily taxed than the rich, and who found a spirited champion in <span
      class="smcap">William Fitz-Osbert</span>, called <span class="smcap">Longbeard</span>.&nbsp;
      He became the leader of a secret society, comprising fifty thousand men;
      he was seized by surprise; he stabbed the citizen who first laid hands
      upon him; and retreated, bravely fighting, to a church, which he
      maintained four days, until he was dislodged by fire, and run through the
      body as he came out.&nbsp; He was not killed, though; for he was dragged,
      half dead, at the tail of a horse to Smithfield, and there hanged.&nbsp;
      Death was long a favourite remedy for silencing the people&rsquo;s
      advocates; but as we go on with this history, I fancy we shall find them
      difficult to make an end of, for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French war, delayed occasionally by a truce, was still in progress
      when a certain Lord named <span class="smcap">Vidomar</span>, Viscount of
      Limoges, chanced to find in his ground a treasure of ancient coins.&nbsp;
      As the King&rsquo;s vassal, he sent the King half of it; but the King
      claimed the whole.&nbsp; The lord refused to yield the whole.&nbsp; The
      King besieged the lord in his castle, swore that he would take the castle
      by storm, and hang every man of its defenders on the battlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange old song in that part of the country, to the effect
      that in Limoges an arrow would be made by which King Richard would die.&nbsp;
      It may be that <span class="smcap">Bertrand de Gourdon</span>, a young man
      who was one of the defenders of the castle, had often sung it or heard it
      sung of a winter night, and remembered it when he saw, from his post upon
      the ramparts, the King attended only by his chief officer riding below the
      walls surveying the place.&nbsp; He drew an arrow to the head, took steady
      aim, said between his teeth, &lsquo;Now I pray God speed thee well, arrow!&rsquo;
      discharged it, and struck the King in the left shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the wound was not at first considered dangerous, it was severe
      enough to cause the King to retire to his tent, and direct the assault to
      be made without him.&nbsp; The castle was taken; and every man of its
      defenders was hanged, as the King had sworn all should be, except Bertrand
      de Gourdon, who was reserved until the royal pleasure respecting him
      should be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that time unskilful treatment had made the wound mortal and the King
      knew that he was dying.&nbsp; He directed Bertrand to be brought into his
      tent.&nbsp; The young man was brought there, heavily chained, King Richard
      looked at him steadily.&nbsp; He looked, as steadily, at the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Knave!&rsquo; said King Richard.&nbsp; &lsquo;What have I done to
      thee that thou shouldest take my life?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What hast thou done to me?&rsquo; replied the young man.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;With thine own hands thou hast killed my father and my two
      brothers.&nbsp; Myself thou wouldest have hanged.&nbsp; Let me die now, by
      any torture that thou wilt.&nbsp; My comfort is, that no torture can save
      Thee.&nbsp; Thou too must die; and, through me, the world is quit of thee!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the King looked at the young man steadily.&nbsp; Again the young man
      looked steadily at him.&nbsp; Perhaps some remembrance of his generous
      enemy Saladin, who was not a Christian, came into the mind of the dying
      King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Youth!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I forgive thee.&nbsp; Go unhurt!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      Then, turning to the chief officer who had been riding in his company when
      he received the wound, King Richard said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take off his chains, give him a hundred shillings, and let him
      depart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sunk down on his couch, and a dark mist seemed in his weakened eyes to
      fill the tent wherein he had so often rested, and he died.&nbsp; His age
      was forty-two; he had reigned ten years.&nbsp; His last command was not
      obeyed; for the chief officer flayed Bertrand de Gourdon alive, and hanged
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an old tune yet known&mdash;a sorrowful air will sometimes
      outlive many generations of strong men, and even last longer than
      battle-axes with twenty pounds of steel in the head&mdash;by which this
      King is said to have been discovered in his captivity.&nbsp; <span
      class="smcap">Blondel</span>, a favourite Minstrel of King Richard, as the
      story relates, faithfully seeking his Royal master, went singing it
      outside the gloomy walls of many foreign fortresses and prisons; until at
      last he heard it echoed from within a dungeon, and knew the voice, and
      cried out in ecstasy, &lsquo;O Richard, O my King!&rsquo;&nbsp; You may
      believe it, if you like; it would be easy to believe worse things.&nbsp;
      Richard was himself a Minstrel and a Poet.&nbsp; If he had not been a
      Prince too, he might have been a better man perhaps, and might have gone
      out of the world with less bloodshed and waste of life to answer for.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER KING JOHN, CALLED LACKLAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      At two-and-thirty years of age, <span class="smcap">John</span> became
      King of England.&nbsp; His pretty little nephew <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>
      had the best claim to the throne; but John seized the treasure, and made
      fine promises to the nobility, and got himself crowned at Westminster
      within a few weeks after his brother Richard&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I doubt
      whether the crown could possibly have been put upon the head of a meaner
      coward, or a more detestable villain, if England had been searched from
      end to end to find him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French King, Philip, refused to acknowledge the right of John to his
      new dignity, and declared in favour of Arthur.&nbsp; You must not suppose
      that he had any generosity of feeling for the fatherless boy; it merely
      suited his ambitious schemes to oppose the King of England.&nbsp; So John
      and the French King went to war about Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a handsome boy, at that time only twelve years old.&nbsp; He was
      not born when his father, Geoffrey, had his brains trampled out at the
      tournament; and, besides the misfortune of never having known a father&rsquo;s
      guidance and protection, he had the additional misfortune to have a
      foolish mother (<span class="smcap">Constance</span> by name), lately
      married to her third husband.&nbsp; She took Arthur, upon John&rsquo;s
      accession, to the French King, who pretended to be very much his friend,
      and who made him a Knight, and promised him his daughter in marriage; but,
      who cared so little about him in reality, that finding it his interest to
      make peace with King John for a time, he did so without the least
      consideration for the poor little Prince, and heartlessly sacrificed all
      his interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Arthur, for two years afterwards, lived quietly; and in the course
      of that time his mother died.&nbsp; But, the French King then finding it
      his interest to quarrel with King John again, again made Arthur his
      pretence, and invited the orphan boy to court.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know your
      rights, Prince,&rsquo; said the French King, &lsquo;and you would like to
      be a King.&nbsp; Is it not so?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Truly,&rsquo; said
      Prince Arthur, &lsquo;I should greatly like to be a King!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Philip, &lsquo;you shall have two hundred
      gentlemen who are Knights of mine, and with them you shall go to win back
      the provinces belonging to you, of which your uncle, the usurping King of
      England, has taken possession.&nbsp; I myself, meanwhile, will head a
      force against him in Normandy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Poor Arthur was so flattered
      and so grateful that he signed a treaty with the crafty French King,
      agreeing to consider him his superior Lord, and that the French King
      should keep for himself whatever he could take from King John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, King John was so bad in all ways, and King Philip was so perfidious,
      that Arthur, between the two, might as well have been a lamb between a fox
      and a wolf.&nbsp; But, being so young, he was ardent and flushed with
      hope; and, when the people of Brittany (which was his inheritance) sent
      him five hundred more knights and five thousand foot soldiers, he believed
      his fortune was made.&nbsp; The people of Brittany had been fond of him
      from his birth, and had requested that he might be called Arthur, in
      remembrance of that dimly-famous English Arthur, of whom I told you early
      in this book, whom they believed to have been the brave friend and
      companion of an old King of their own.&nbsp; They had tales among them
      about a prophet called <span class="smcap">Merlin</span> (of the same old
      time), who had foretold that their own King should be restored to them
      after hundreds of years; and they believed that the prophecy would be
      fulfilled in Arthur; that the time would come when he would rule them with
      a crown of Brittany upon his head; and when neither King of France nor
      King of England would have any power over them.&nbsp; When Arthur found
      himself riding in a glittering suit of armour on a richly caparisoned
      horse, at the head of his train of knights and soldiers, he began to
      believe this too, and to consider old Merlin a very superior prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know&mdash;how could he, being so innocent and inexperienced?&mdash;that
      his little army was a mere nothing against the power of the King of
      England.&nbsp; The French King knew it; but the poor boy&rsquo;s fate was
      little to him, so that the King of England was worried and distressed.&nbsp;
      Therefore, King Philip went his way into Normandy and Prince Arthur went
      his way towards Mirebeau, a French town near Poictiers, both very well
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Arthur went to attack the town of Mirebeau, because his grandmother
      Eleanor, who has so often made her appearance in this history (and who had
      always been his mother&rsquo;s enemy), was living there, and because his
      Knights said, &lsquo;Prince, if you can take her prisoner, you will be
      able to bring the King your uncle to terms!&rsquo;&nbsp; But she was not
      to be easily taken.&nbsp; She was old enough by this time&mdash;eighty&mdash;but
      she was as full of stratagem as she was full of years and wickedness.&nbsp;
      Receiving intelligence of young Arthur&rsquo;s approach, she shut herself
      up in a high tower, and encouraged her soldiers to defend it like men.&nbsp;
      Prince Arthur with his little army besieged the high tower.&nbsp; King
      John, hearing how matters stood, came up to the rescue, with <i>his</i>
      army.&nbsp; So here was a strange family-party!&nbsp; The boy-Prince
      besieging his grandmother, and his uncle besieging him!
    </p>
    <p>
      This position of affairs did not last long.&nbsp; One summer night King
      John, by treachery, got his men into the town, surprised Prince Arthur&rsquo;s
      force, took two hundred of his knights, and seized the Prince himself in
      his bed.&nbsp; The Knights were put in heavy irons, and driven away in
      open carts drawn by bullocks, to various dungeons where they were most
      inhumanly treated, and where some of them were starved to death.&nbsp;
      Prince Arthur was sent to the castle of Falaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, while he was in prison at that castle, mournfully thinking it
      strange that one so young should be in so much trouble, and looking out of
      the small window in the deep dark wall, at the summer sky and the birds,
      the door was softly opened, and he saw his uncle the King standing in the
      shadow of the archway, looking very grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arthur,&rsquo; said the King, with his wicked eyes more on the
      stone floor than on his nephew, &lsquo;will you not trust to the
      gentleness, the friendship, and the truthfulness of your loving uncle?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell my loving uncle that,&rsquo; replied the boy, &lsquo;when
      he does me right.&nbsp; Let him restore to me my kingdom of England, and
      then come to me and ask the question.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The King looked at him and went out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep that boy close
      prisoner,&rsquo; said he to the warden of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the King took secret counsel with the worst of his nobles how the
      Prince was to be got rid of.&nbsp; Some said, &lsquo;Put out his eyes and
      keep him in prison, as Robort of Normandy was kept.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others
      said, &lsquo;Have him stabbed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others, &lsquo;Have him
      hanged.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others, &lsquo;Have him poisoned.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      King John, feeling that in any case, whatever was done afterwards, it
      would be a satisfaction to his mind to have those handsome eyes burnt out
      that had looked at him so proudly while his own royal eyes were blinking
      at the stone floor, sent certain ruffians to Falaise to blind the boy with
      red-hot irons.&nbsp; But Arthur so pathetically entreated them, and shed
      such piteous tears, and so appealed to <span class="smcap">Hubert de Bourg</span>
      (or <span class="smcap">Burgh</span>), the warden of the castle, who had a
      love for him, and was an honourable, tender man, that Hubert could not
      bear it.&nbsp; To his eternal honour he prevented the torture from being
      performed, and, at his own risk, sent the savages away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chafed and disappointed King bethought himself of the stabbing
      suggestion next, and, with his shuffling manner and his cruel face,
      proposed it to one William de Bray.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a gentleman and not
      an executioner,&rsquo; said William de Bray, and left the presence with
      disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not difficult for a King to hire a murderer in those days.&nbsp;
      King John found one for his money, and sent him down to the castle of
      Falaise.&nbsp; &lsquo;On what errand dost thou come?&rsquo; said Hubert to
      this fellow.&nbsp; &lsquo;To despatch young Arthur,&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;Go back to him who sent thee,&rsquo; answered Hubert, &lsquo;and
      say that I will do it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      King John very well knowing that Hubert would never do it, but that he
      courageously sent this reply to save the Prince or gain time, despatched
      messengers to convey the young prisoner to the castle of Rouen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was soon forced from the good Hubert&mdash;of whom he had never
      stood in greater need than then&mdash;carried away by night, and lodged in
      his new prison: where, through his grated window, he could hear the deep
      waters of the river Seine, rippling against the stone wall below.
    </p>
    <p>
      One dark night, as he lay sleeping, dreaming perhaps of rescue by those
      unfortunate gentlemen who were obscurely suffering and dying in his cause,
      he was roused, and bidden by his jailer to come down the staircase to the
      foot of the tower.&nbsp; He hurriedly dressed himself and obeyed.&nbsp;
      When they came to the bottom of the winding stairs, and the night air from
      the river blew upon their faces, the jailer trod upon his torch and put it
      out.&nbsp; Then, Arthur, in the darkness, was hurriedly drawn into a
      solitary boat.&nbsp; And in that boat, he found his uncle and one other
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt to them, and prayed them not to murder him.&nbsp; Deaf to his
      entreaties, they stabbed him and sunk his body in the river with heavy
      stones.&nbsp; When the spring-morning broke, the tower-door was closed,
      the boat was gone, the river sparkled on its way, and never more was any
      trace of the poor boy beheld by mortal eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of this atrocious murder being spread in England, awakened a
      hatred of the King (already odious for his many vices, and for his having
      stolen away and married a noble lady while his own wife was living) that
      never slept again through his whole reign.&nbsp; In Brittany, the
      indignation was intense.&nbsp; Arthur&rsquo;s own sister <span
      class="smcap">Eleanor</span> was in the power of John and shut up in a
      convent at Bristol, but his half-sister <span class="smcap">Alice</span>
      was in Brittany.&nbsp; The people chose her, and the murdered prince&rsquo;s
      father-in-law, the last husband of Constance, to represent them; and
      carried their fiery complaints to King Philip.&nbsp; King Philip summoned
      King John (as the holder of territory in France) to come before him and
      defend himself.&nbsp; King John refusing to appear, King Philip declared
      him false, perjured, and guilty; and again made war.&nbsp; In a little
      time, by conquering the greater part of his French territory, King Philip
      deprived him of one-third of his dominions.&nbsp; And, through all the
      fighting that took place, King John was always found, either to be eating
      and drinking, like a gluttonous fool, when the danger was at a distance,
      or to be running away, like a beaten cur, when it was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might suppose that when he was losing his dominions at this rate, and
      when his own nobles cared so little for him or his cause that they plainly
      refused to follow his banner out of England, he had enemies enough.&nbsp;
      But he made another enemy of the Pope, which he did in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Archbishop of Canterbury dying, and the junior monks of that place
      wishing to get the start of the senior monks in the appointment of his
      successor, met together at midnight, secretly elected a certain <span
      class="smcap">Reginald</span>, and sent him off to Rome to get the Pope&rsquo;s
      approval.&nbsp; The senior monks and the King soon finding this out, and
      being very angry about it, the junior monks gave way, and all the monks
      together elected the Bishop of Norwich, who was the King&rsquo;s
      favourite.&nbsp; The Pope, hearing the whole story, declared that neither
      election would do for him, and that <i>he</i> elected <span class="smcap">Stephen
      Langton</span>.&nbsp; The monks submitting to the Pope, the King turned
      them all out bodily, and banished them as traitors.&nbsp; The Pope sent
      three bishops to the King, to threaten him with an Interdict.&nbsp; The
      King told the bishops that if any Interdict were laid upon his kingdom, he
      would tear out the eyes and cut off the noses of all the monks he could
      lay hold of, and send them over to Rome in that undecorated state as a
      present for their master.&nbsp; The bishops, nevertheless, soon published
      the Interdict, and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      After it had lasted a year, the Pope proceeded to his next step; which was
      Excommunication.&nbsp; King John was declared excommunicated, with all the
      usual ceremonies.&nbsp; The King was so incensed at this, and was made so
      desperate by the disaffection of his Barons and the hatred of his people,
      that it is said he even privately sent ambassadors to the Turks in Spain,
      offering to renounce his religion and hold his kingdom of them if they
      would help him.&nbsp; It is related that the ambassadors were admitted to
      the presence of the Turkish Emir through long lines of Moorish guards, and
      that they found the Emir with his eyes seriously fixed on the pages of a
      large book, from which he never once looked up.&nbsp; That they gave him a
      letter from the King containing his proposals, and were gravely dismissed.&nbsp;
      That presently the Emir sent for one of them, and conjured him, by his
      faith in his religion, to say what kind of man the King of England truly
      was?&nbsp; That the ambassador, thus pressed, replied that the King of
      England was a false tyrant, against whom his own subjects would soon rise.&nbsp;
      And that this was quite enough for the Emir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money being, in his position, the next best thing to men, King John spared
      no means of getting it.&nbsp; He set on foot another oppressing and
      torturing of the unhappy Jews (which was quite in his way), and invented a
      new punishment for one wealthy Jew of Bristol.&nbsp; Until such time as
      that Jew should produce a certain large sum of money, the King sentenced
      him to be imprisoned, and, every day, to have one tooth violently wrenched
      out of his head&mdash;beginning with the double teeth.&nbsp; For seven
      days, the oppressed man bore the daily pain and lost the daily tooth; but,
      on the eighth, he paid the money.&nbsp; With the treasure raised in such
      ways, the King made an expedition into Ireland, where some English nobles
      had revolted.&nbsp; It was one of the very few places from which he did
      not run away; because no resistance was shown.&nbsp; He made another
      expedition into Wales&mdash;whence he <i>did</i> run away in the end: but
      not before he had got from the Welsh people, as hostages, twenty-seven
      young men of the best families; every one of whom he caused to be slain in
      the following year.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Interdict and Excommunication, the Pope now added his last sentence;
      Deposition.&nbsp; He proclaimed John no longer King, absolved all his
      subjects from their allegiance, and sent Stephen Langton and others to the
      King of France to tell him that, if he would invade England, he should be
      forgiven all his sins&mdash;at least, should be forgiven them by the Pope,
      if that would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing that King Philip desired more than to invade England,
      he collected a great army at Rouen, and a fleet of seventeen hundred ships
      to bring them over.&nbsp; But the English people, however bitterly they
      hated the King, were not a people to suffer invasion quietly.&nbsp; They
      flocked to Dover, where the English standard was, in such great numbers to
      enrol themselves as defenders of their native land, that there were not
      provisions for them, and the King could only select and retain sixty
      thousand.&nbsp; But, at this crisis, the Pope, who had his own reasons for
      objecting to either King John or King Philip being too powerful,
      interfered.&nbsp; He entrusted a legate, whose name was <span class="smcap">Pandolf</span>,
      with the easy task of frightening King John.&nbsp; He sent him to the
      English Camp, from France, to terrify him with exaggerations of King
      Philip&rsquo;s power, and his own weakness in the discontent of the
      English Barons and people.&nbsp; Pandolf discharged his commission so
      well, that King John, in a wretched panic, consented to acknowledge
      Stephen Langton; to resign his kingdom &lsquo;to God, Saint Peter, and
      Saint Paul&rsquo;&mdash;which meant the Pope; and to hold it, ever
      afterwards, by the Pope&rsquo;s leave, on payment of an annual sum of
      money.&nbsp; To this shameful contract he publicly bound himself in the
      church of the Knights Templars at Dover: where he laid at the legate&rsquo;s
      feet a part of the tribute, which the legate haughtily trampled upon.&nbsp;
      But they <i>do</i> say, that this was merely a genteel flourish, and that
      he was afterwards seen to pick it up and pocket it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an unfortunate prophet, the name of Peter, who had greatly
      increased King John&rsquo;s terrors by predicting that he would be
      unknighted (which the King supposed to signify that he would die) before
      the Feast of the Ascension should be past.&nbsp; That was the day after
      this humiliation.&nbsp; When the next morning came, and the King, who had
      been trembling all night, found himself alive and safe, he ordered the
      prophet&mdash;and his son too&mdash;to be dragged through the streets at
      the tails of horses, and then hanged, for having frightened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As King John had now submitted, the Pope, to King Philip&rsquo;s great
      astonishment, took him under his protection, and informed King Philip that
      he found he could not give him leave to invade England.&nbsp; The angry
      Philip resolved to do it without his leave but he gained nothing and lost
      much; for, the English, commanded by the Earl of Salisbury, went over, in
      five hundred ships, to the French coast, before the French fleet had
      sailed away from it, and utterly defeated the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope then took off his three sentences, one after another, and
      empowered Stephen Langton publicly to receive King John into the favour of
      the Church again, and to ask him to dinner.&nbsp; The King, who hated
      Langton with all his might and main&mdash;and with reason too, for he was
      a great and a good man, with whom such a King could have no sympathy&mdash;pretended
      to cry and to be <i>very</i> grateful.&nbsp; There was a little difficulty
      about settling how much the King should pay as a recompense to the clergy
      for the losses he had caused them; but, the end of it was, that the
      superior clergy got a good deal, and the inferior clergy got little or
      nothing&mdash;which has also happened since King John&rsquo;s time, I
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all these matters were arranged, the King in his triumph became more
      fierce, and false, and insolent to all around him than he had ever been.&nbsp;
      An alliance of sovereigns against King Philip, gave him an opportunity of
      landing an army in France; with which he even took a town!&nbsp; But, on
      the French King&rsquo;s gaining a great victory, he ran away, of course,
      and made a truce for five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the time approached when he was to be still further humbled, and
      made to feel, if he could feel anything, what a wretched creature he was.&nbsp;
      Of all men in the world, Stephen Langton seemed raised up by Heaven to
      oppose and subdue him.&nbsp; When he ruthlessly burnt and destroyed the
      property of his own subjects, because their Lords, the Barons, would not
      serve him abroad, Stephen Langton fearlessly reproved and threatened him.&nbsp;
      When he swore to restore the laws of King Edward, or the laws of King
      Henry the First, Stephen Langton knew his falsehood, and pursued him
      through all his evasions.&nbsp; When the Barons met at the abbey of Saint
      Edmund&rsquo;s-Bury, to consider their wrongs and the King&rsquo;s
      oppressions, Stephen Langton roused them by his fervid words to demand a
      solemn charter of rights and liberties from their perjured master, and to
      swear, one by one, on the High Altar, that they would have it, or would
      wage war against him to the death.&nbsp; When the King hid himself in
      London from the Barons, and was at last obliged to receive them, they told
      him roundly they would not believe him unless Stephen Langton became a
      surety that he would keep his word.&nbsp; When he took the Cross to invest
      himself with some interest, and belong to something that was received with
      favour, Stephen Langton was still immovable.&nbsp; When he appealed to the
      Pope, and the Pope wrote to Stephen Langton in behalf of his new
      favourite, Stephen Langton was deaf, even to the Pope himself, and saw
      before him nothing but the welfare of England and the crimes of the
      English King.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Easter-time, the Barons assembled at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, in
      proud array, and, marching near to Oxford where the King was, delivered
      into the hands of Stephen Langton and two others, a list of grievances.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;And these,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;he must redress, or we will do
      it for ourselves!&rsquo;&nbsp; When Stephen Langton told the King as much,
      and read the list to him, he went half mad with rage.&nbsp; But that did
      him no more good than his afterwards trying to pacify the Barons with
      lies.&nbsp; They called themselves and their followers, &lsquo;The army of
      God and the Holy Church.&rsquo;&nbsp; Marching through the country, with
      the people thronging to them everywhere (except at Northampton, where they
      failed in an attack upon the castle), they at last triumphantly set up
      their banner in London itself, whither the whole land, tired of the
      tyrant, seemed to flock to join them.&nbsp; Seven knights alone, of all
      the knights in England, remained with the King; who, reduced to this
      strait, at last sent the Earl of Pembroke to the Barons to say that he
      approved of everything, and would meet them to sign their charter when
      they would.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Barons, &lsquo;let the day
      be the fifteenth of June, and the place, Runny-Mead.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, the fifteenth of June, one thousand two hundred and fourteen,
      the King came from Windsor Castle, and the Barons came from the town of
      Staines, and they met on Runny-Mead, which is still a pleasant meadow by
      the Thames, where rushes grow in the clear water of the winding river, and
      its banks are green with grass and trees.&nbsp; On the side of the Barons,
      came the General of their army, <span class="smcap">Robert Fitz-Walter</span>,
      and a great concourse of the nobility of England.&nbsp; With the King,
      came, in all, some four-and-twenty persons of any note, most of whom
      despised him, and were merely his advisers in form.&nbsp; On that great
      day, and in that great company, the King signed <span class="smcap">Magna
      Charta</span>&mdash;the great charter of England&mdash;by which he pledged
      himself to maintain the Church in its rights; to relieve the Barons of
      oppressive obligations as vassals of the Crown&mdash;of which the Barons,
      in their turn, pledged themselves to relieve <i>their</i> vassals, the
      people; to respect the liberties of London and all other cities and
      boroughs; to protect foreign merchants who came to England; to imprison no
      man without a fair trial; and to sell, delay, or deny justice to none.&nbsp;
      As the Barons knew his falsehood well, they further required, as their
      securities, that he should send out of his kingdom all his foreign troops;
      that for two months they should hold possession of the city of London, and
      Stephen Langton of the Tower; and that five-and-twenty of their body,
      chosen by themselves, should be a lawful committee to watch the keeping of
      the charter, and to make war upon him if he broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this he was obliged to yield.&nbsp; He signed the charter with a
      smile, and, if he could have looked agreeable, would have done so, as he
      departed from the splendid assembly.&nbsp; When he got home to Windsor
      Castle, he was quite a madman in his helpless fury.&nbsp; And he broke the
      charter immediately afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent abroad for foreign soldiers, and sent to the Pope for help, and
      plotted to take London by surprise, while the Barons should be holding a
      great tournament at Stamford, which they had agreed to hold there as a
      celebration of the charter.&nbsp; The Barons, however, found him out and
      put it off.&nbsp; Then, when the Barons desired to see him and tax him
      with his treachery, he made numbers of appointments with them, and kept
      none, and shifted from place to place, and was constantly sneaking and
      skulking about.&nbsp; At last he appeared at Dover, to join his foreign
      soldiers, of whom numbers came into his pay; and with them he besieged and
      took Rochester Castle, which was occupied by knights and soldiers of the
      Barons.&nbsp; He would have hanged them every one; but the leader of the
      foreign soldiers, fearful of what the English people might afterwards do
      to him, interfered to save the knights; therefore the King was fain to
      satisfy his vengeance with the death of all the common men.&nbsp; Then, he
      sent the Earl of Salisbury, with one portion of his army, to ravage the
      eastern part of his own dominions, while he carried fire and slaughter
      into the northern part; torturing, plundering, killing, and inflicting
      every possible cruelty upon the people; and, every morning, setting a
      worthy example to his men by setting fire, with his own monster-hands, to
      the house where he had slept last night.&nbsp; Nor was this all; for the
      Pope, coming to the aid of his precious friend, laid the kingdom under an
      Interdict again, because the people took part with the Barons.&nbsp; It
      did not much matter, for the people had grown so used to it now, that they
      had begun to think nothing about it.&nbsp; It occurred to them&mdash;perhaps
      to Stephen Langton too&mdash;that they could keep their churches open, and
      ring their bells, without the Pope&rsquo;s permission as well as with it.&nbsp;
      So, they tried the experiment&mdash;and found that it succeeded perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being now impossible to bear the country, as a wilderness of cruelty,
      or longer to hold any terms with such a forsworn outlaw of a King, the
      Barons sent to Louis, son of the French monarch, to offer him the English
      crown.&nbsp; Caring as little for the Pope&rsquo;s excommunication of him
      if he accepted the offer, as it is possible his father may have cared for
      the Pope&rsquo;s forgiveness of his sins, he landed at Sandwich (King John
      immediately running away from Dover, where he happened to be), and went on
      to London.&nbsp; The Scottish King, with whom many of the Northern English
      Lords had taken refuge; numbers of the foreign soldiers, numbers of the
      Barons, and numbers of the people went over to him every day;&mdash;King
      John, the while, continually running away in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The career of Louis was checked however, by the suspicions of the Barons,
      founded on the dying declaration of a French Lord, that when the kingdom
      was conquered he was sworn to banish them as traitors, and to give their
      estates to some of his own Nobles.&nbsp; Rather than suffer this, some of
      the Barons hesitated: others even went over to King John.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to be the turning-point of King John&rsquo;s fortunes, for, in
      his savage and murderous course, he had now taken some towns and met with
      some successes.&nbsp; But, happily for England and humanity, his death was
      near.&nbsp; Crossing a dangerous quicksand, called the Wash, not very far
      from Wisbeach, the tide came up and nearly drowned his army.&nbsp; He and
      his soldiers escaped; but, looking back from the shore when he was safe,
      he saw the roaring water sweep down in a torrent, overturn the waggons,
      horses, and men, that carried his treasure, and engulf them in a raging
      whirlpool from which nothing could be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cursing, and swearing, and gnawing his fingers, he went on to Swinestead
      Abbey, where the monks set before him quantities of pears, and peaches,
      and new cider&mdash;some say poison too, but there is very little reason
      to suppose so&mdash;of which he ate and drank in an immoderate and beastly
      way.&nbsp; All night he lay ill of a burning fever, and haunted with
      horrible fears.&nbsp; Next day, they put him in a horse-litter, and
      carried him to Sleaford Castle, where he passed another night of pain and
      horror.&nbsp; Next day, they carried him, with greater difficulty than on
      the day before, to the castle of Newark upon Trent; and there, on the
      eighteenth of October, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and the
      seventeenth of his vile reign, was an end of this miserable brute.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE THIRD, CALLED, OF WINCHESTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      If any of the English Barons remembered the murdered Arthur&rsquo;s
      sister, Eleanor the fair maid of Brittany, shut up in her convent at
      Bristol, none among them spoke of her now, or maintained her right to the
      Crown.&nbsp; The dead Usurper&rsquo;s eldest boy, <span class="smcap">Henry</span>
      by name, was taken by the Earl of Pembroke, the Marshal of England, to the
      city of Gloucester, and there crowned in great haste when he was only ten
      years old.&nbsp; As the Crown itself had been lost with the King&rsquo;s
      treasure in the raging water, and as there was no time to make another,
      they put a circle of plain gold upon his head instead.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
      have been the enemies of this child&rsquo;s father,&rsquo; said Lord
      Pembroke, a good and true gentleman, to the few Lords who were present,
      &lsquo;and he merited our ill-will; but the child himself is innocent, and
      his youth demands our friendship and protection.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those Lords
      felt tenderly towards the little boy, remembering their own young
      children; and they bowed their heads, and said, &lsquo;Long live King
      Henry the Third!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, a great council met at Bristol, revised Magna Charta, and made Lord
      Pembroke Regent or Protector of England, as the King was too young to
      reign alone.&nbsp; The next thing to be done, was to get rid of Prince
      Louis of France, and to win over those English Barons who were still
      ranged under his banner.&nbsp; He was strong in many parts of England, and
      in London itself; and he held, among other places, a certain Castle called
      the Castle of Mount Sorel, in Leicestershire.&nbsp; To this fortress,
      after some skirmishing and truce-making, Lord Pembroke laid siege.&nbsp;
      Louis despatched an army of six hundred knights and twenty thousand
      soldiers to relieve it.&nbsp; Lord Pembroke, who was not strong enough for
      such a force, retired with all his men.&nbsp; The army of the French
      Prince, which had marched there with fire and plunder, marched away with
      fire and plunder, and came, in a boastful swaggering manner, to Lincoln.&nbsp;
      The town submitted; but the Castle in the town, held by a brave widow
      lady, named <span class="smcap">Nichola de Camville</span> (whose property
      it was), made such a sturdy resistance, that the French Count in command
      of the army of the French Prince found it necessary to besiege this
      Castle.&nbsp; While he was thus engaged, word was brought to him that Lord
      Pembroke, with four hundred knights, two hundred and fifty men with
      cross-bows, and a stout force both of horse and foot, was marching towards
      him.&nbsp; &lsquo;What care I?&rsquo; said the French Count.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
      Englishman is not so mad as to attack me and my great army in a walled
      town!&rsquo;&nbsp; But the Englishman did it for all that, and did it&mdash;not
      so madly but so wisely, that he decoyed the great army into the narrow,
      ill-paved lanes and byways of Lincoln, where its horse-soldiers could not
      ride in any strong body; and there he made such havoc with them, that the
      whole force surrendered themselves prisoners, except the Count; who said
      that he would never yield to any English traitor alive, and accordingly
      got killed.&nbsp; The end of this victory, which the English called, for a
      joke, the Fair of Lincoln, was the usual one in those times&mdash;the
      common men were slain without any mercy, and the knights and gentlemen
      paid ransom and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife of Louis, the fair <span class="smcap">Blanche of Castile</span>,
      dutifully equipped a fleet of eighty good ships, and sent it over from
      France to her husband&rsquo;s aid.&nbsp; An English fleet of forty ships,
      some good and some bad, gallantly met them near the mouth of the Thames,
      and took or sunk sixty-five in one fight.&nbsp; This great loss put an end
      to the French Prince&rsquo;s hopes.&nbsp; A treaty was made at Lambeth, in
      virtue of which the English Barons who had remained attached to his cause
      returned to their allegiance, and it was engaged on both sides that the
      Prince and all his troops should retire peacefully to France.&nbsp; It was
      time to go; for war had made him so poor that he was obliged to borrow
      money from the citizens of London to pay his expenses home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Pembroke afterwards applied himself to governing the country justly,
      and to healing the quarrels and disturbances that had arisen among men in
      the days of the bad King John.&nbsp; He caused Magna Charta to be still
      more improved, and so amended the Forest Laws that a Peasant was no longer
      put to death for killing a stag in a Royal Forest, but was only
      imprisoned.&nbsp; It would have been well for England if it could have had
      so good a Protector many years longer, but that was not to be.&nbsp;
      Within three years after the young King&rsquo;s Coronation, Lord Pembroke
      died; and you may see his tomb, at this day, in the old Temple Church in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protectorship was now divided.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Peter de
      Roches</span>, whom King John had made Bishop of Winchester, was entrusted
      with the care of the person of the young sovereign; and the exercise of
      the Royal authority was confided to <span class="smcap">Earl Hubert de
      Burgh</span>.&nbsp; These two personages had from the first no liking for
      each other, and soon became enemies.&nbsp; When the young King was
      declared of age, Peter de Roches, finding that Hubert increased in power
      and favour, retired discontentedly, and went abroad.&nbsp; For nearly ten
      years afterwards Hubert had full sway alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But ten years is a long time to hold the favour of a King.&nbsp; This
      King, too, as he grew up, showed a strong resemblance to his father, in
      feebleness, inconsistency, and irresolution.&nbsp; The best that can be
      said of him is that he was not cruel.&nbsp; De Roches coming home again,
      after ten years, and being a novelty, the King began to favour him and to
      look coldly on Hubert.&nbsp; Wanting money besides, and having made Hubert
      rich, he began to dislike Hubert.&nbsp; At last he was made to believe, or
      pretended to believe, that Hubert had misappropriated some of the Royal
      treasure; and ordered him to furnish an account of all he had done in his
      administration.&nbsp; Besides which, the foolish charge was brought
      against Hubert that he had made himself the King&rsquo;s favourite by
      magic.&nbsp; Hubert very well knowing that he could never defend himself
      against such nonsense, and that his old enemy must be determined on his
      ruin, instead of answering the charges fled to Merton Abbey.&nbsp; Then
      the King, in a violent passion, sent for the Mayor of London, and said to
      the Mayor, &lsquo;Take twenty thousand citizens, and drag me Hubert de
      Burgh out of that abbey, and bring him here.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Mayor posted
      off to do it, but the Archbishop of Dublin (who was a friend of Hubert&rsquo;s)
      warning the King that an abbey was a sacred place, and that if he
      committed any violence there, he must answer for it to the Church, the
      King changed his mind and called the Mayor back, and declared that Hubert
      should have four months to prepare his defence, and should be safe and
      free during that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert, who relied upon the King&rsquo;s word, though I think he was old
      enough to have known better, came out of Merton Abbey upon these
      conditions, and journeyed away to see his wife: a Scottish Princess who
      was then at St. Edmund&rsquo;s-Bury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as soon as he had departed from the Sanctuary, his enemies
      persuaded the weak King to send out one <span class="smcap">Sir Godfrey de
      Crancumb</span>, who commanded three hundred vagabonds called the Black
      Band, with orders to seize him.&nbsp; They came up with him at a little
      town in Essex, called Brentwood, when he was in bed.&nbsp; He leaped out
      of bed, got out of the house, fled to the church, ran up to the altar, and
      laid his hand upon the cross.&nbsp; Sir Godfrey and the Black Band, caring
      neither for church, altar, nor cross, dragged him forth to the church
      door, with their drawn swords flashing round his head, and sent for a
      Smith to rivet a set of chains upon him.&nbsp; When the Smith (I wish I
      knew his name!) was brought, all dark and swarthy with the smoke of his
      forge, and panting with the speed he had made; and the Black Band, falling
      aside to show him the Prisoner, cried with a loud uproar, &lsquo;Make the
      fetters heavy! make them strong!&rsquo; the Smith dropped upon his knee&mdash;but
      not to the Black Band&mdash;and said, &lsquo;This is the brave Earl Hubert
      de Burgh, who fought at Dover Castle, and destroyed the French fleet, and
      has done his country much good service.&nbsp; You may kill me, if you
      like, but I will never make a chain for Earl Hubert de Burgh!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Band never blushed, or they might have blushed at this.&nbsp;
      They knocked the Smith about from one to another, and swore at him, and
      tied the Earl on horseback, undressed as he was, and carried him off to
      the Tower of London.&nbsp; The Bishops, however, were so indignant at the
      violation of the Sanctuary of the Church, that the frightened King soon
      ordered the Black Band to take him back again; at the same time commanding
      the Sheriff of Essex to prevent his escaping out of Brentwood Church.&nbsp;
      Well! the Sheriff dug a deep trench all round the church, and erected a
      high fence, and watched the church night and day; the Black Band and their
      Captain watched it too, like three hundred and one black wolves.&nbsp; For
      thirty-nine days, Hubert de Burgh remained within.&nbsp; At length, upon
      the fortieth day, cold and hunger were too much for him, and he gave
      himself up to the Black Band, who carried him off, for the second time, to
      the Tower.&nbsp; When his trial came on, he refused to plead; but at last
      it was arranged that he should give up all the royal lands which had been
      bestowed upon him, and should be kept at the Castle of Devizes, in what
      was called &lsquo;free prison,&rsquo; in charge of four knights appointed
      by four lords.&nbsp; There, he remained almost a year, until, learning
      that a follower of his old enemy the Bishop was made Keeper of the Castle,
      and fearing that he might be killed by treachery, he climbed the ramparts
      one dark night, dropped from the top of the high Castle wall into the
      moat, and coming safely to the ground, took refuge in another church.&nbsp;
      From this place he was delivered by a party of horse despatched to his
      help by some nobles, who were by this time in revolt against the King, and
      assembled in Wales.&nbsp; He was finally pardoned and restored to his
      estates, but he lived privately, and never more aspired to a high post in
      the realm, or to a high place in the King&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; And thus
      end&mdash;more happily than the stories of many favourites of Kings&mdash;the
      adventures of Earl Hubert de Burgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nobles, who had risen in revolt, were stirred up to rebellion by the
      overbearing conduct of the Bishop of Winchester, who, finding that the
      King secretly hated the Great Charter which had been forced from his
      father, did his utmost to confirm him in that dislike, and in the
      preference he showed to foreigners over the English.&nbsp; Of this, and of
      his even publicly declaring that the Barons of England were inferior to
      those of France, the English Lords complained with such bitterness, that
      the King, finding them well supported by the clergy, became frightened for
      his throne, and sent away the Bishop and all his foreign associates.&nbsp;
      On his marriage, however, with <span class="smcap">Eleanor</span>, a
      French lady, the daughter of the Count of Provence, he openly favoured the
      foreigners again; and so many of his wife&rsquo;s relations came over, and
      made such an immense family-party at court, and got so many good things,
      and pocketed so much money, and were so high with the English whose money
      they pocketed, that the bolder English Barons murmured openly about a
      clause there was in the Great Charter, which provided for the banishment
      of unreasonable favourites.&nbsp; But, the foreigners only laughed
      disdainfully, and said, &lsquo;What are your English laws to us?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      King Philip of France had died, and had been succeeded by Prince Louis,
      who had also died after a short reign of three years, and had been
      succeeded by his son of the same name&mdash;so moderate and just a man
      that he was not the least in the world like a King, as Kings went.&nbsp;
      <span class="smcap">Isabella</span>, King Henry&rsquo;s mother, wished
      very much (for a certain spite she had) that England should make war
      against this King; and, as King Henry was a mere puppet in anybody&rsquo;s
      hands who knew how to manage his feebleness, she easily carried her point
      with him.&nbsp; But, the Parliament were determined to give him no money
      for such a war.&nbsp; So, to defy the Parliament, he packed up thirty
      large casks of silver&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how he got so much; I dare
      say he screwed it out of the miserable Jews&mdash;and put them aboard
      ship, and went away himself to carry war into France: accompanied by his
      mother and his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who was rich and clever.&nbsp;
      But he only got well beaten, and came home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good-humour of the Parliament was not restored by this.&nbsp; They
      reproached the King with wasting the public money to make greedy
      foreigners rich, and were so stern with him, and so determined not to let
      him have more of it to waste if they could help it, that he was at his wit&rsquo;s
      end for some, and tried so shamelessly to get all he could from his
      subjects, by excuses or by force, that the people used to say the King was
      the sturdiest beggar in England.&nbsp; He took the Cross, thinking to get
      some money by that means; but, as it was very well known that he never
      meant to go on a crusade, he got none.&nbsp; In all this contention, the
      Londoners were particularly keen against the King, and the King hated them
      warmly in return.&nbsp; Hating or loving, however, made no difference; he
      continued in the same condition for nine or ten years, when at last the
      Barons said that if he would solemnly confirm their liberties afresh, the
      Parliament would vote him a large sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he readily consented, there was a great meeting held in Westminster
      Hall, one pleasant day in May, when all the clergy, dressed in their robes
      and holding every one of them a burning candle in his hand, stood up (the
      Barons being also there) while the Archbishop of Canterbury read the
      sentence of excommunication against any man, and all men, who should
      henceforth, in any way, infringe the Great Charter of the Kingdom.&nbsp;
      When he had done, they all put out their burning candles with a curse upon
      the soul of any one, and every one, who should merit that sentence.&nbsp;
      The King concluded with an oath to keep the Charter, &lsquo;As I am a man,
      as I am a Christian, as I am a Knight, as I am a King!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to make oaths, and easy to break them; and the King did both,
      as his father had done before him.&nbsp; He took to his old courses again
      when he was supplied with money, and soon cured of their weakness the few
      who had ever really trusted him.&nbsp; When his money was gone, and he was
      once more borrowing and begging everywhere with a meanness worthy of his
      nature, he got into a difficulty with the Pope respecting the Crown of
      Sicily, which the Pope said he had a right to give away, and which he
      offered to King Henry for his second son, <span class="smcap">Prince
      Edmund</span>.&nbsp; But, if you or I give away what we have not got, and
      what belongs to somebody else, it is likely that the person to whom we
      give it, will have some trouble in taking it.&nbsp; It was exactly so in
      this case.&nbsp; It was necessary to conquer the Sicilian Crown before it
      could be put upon young Edmund&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; It could not be
      conquered without money.&nbsp; The Pope ordered the clergy to raise money.&nbsp;
      The clergy, however, were not so obedient to him as usual; they had been
      disputing with him for some time about his unjust preference of Italian
      Priests in England; and they had begun to doubt whether the King&rsquo;s
      chaplain, whom he allowed to be paid for preaching in seven hundred
      churches, could possibly be, even by the Pope&rsquo;s favour, in seven
      hundred places at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Pope and the King together,&rsquo;
      said the Bishop of London, &lsquo;may take the mitre off my head; but, if
      they do, they will find that I shall put on a soldier&rsquo;s helmet.&nbsp;
      I pay nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bishop of Worcester was as bold as the
      Bishop of London, and would pay nothing either.&nbsp; Such sums as the
      more timid or more helpless of the clergy did raise were squandered away,
      without doing any good to the King, or bringing the Sicilian Crown an inch
      nearer to Prince Edmund&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The end of the business was,
      that the Pope gave the Crown to the brother of the King of France (who
      conquered it for himself), and sent the King of England in, a bill of one
      hundred thousand pounds for the expenses of not having won it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was now so much distressed that we might almost pity him, if it
      were possible to pity a King so shabby and ridiculous.&nbsp; His clever
      brother, Richard, had bought the title of King of the Romans from the
      German people, and was no longer near him, to help him with advice.&nbsp;
      The clergy, resisting the very Pope, were in alliance with the Barons.&nbsp;
      The Barons were headed by <span class="smcap">Simon de Montfort</span>,
      Earl of Leicester, married to King Henry&rsquo;s sister, and, though a
      foreigner himself, the most popular man in England against the foreign
      favourites.&nbsp; When the King next met his Parliament, the Barons, led
      by this Earl, came before him, armed from head to foot, and cased in
      armour.&nbsp; When the Parliament again assembled, in a month&rsquo;s
      time, at Oxford, this Earl was at their head, and the King was obliged to
      consent, on oath, to what was called a Committee of Government: consisting
      of twenty-four members: twelve chosen by the Barons, and twelve chosen by
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, at a good time for him, his brother Richard came back.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s
      first act (the Barons would not admit him into England on other terms) was
      to swear to be faithful to the Committee of Government&mdash;which he
      immediately began to oppose with all his might.&nbsp; Then, the Barons
      began to quarrel among themselves; especially the proud Earl of Gloucester
      with the Earl of Leicester, who went abroad in disgust.&nbsp; Then, the
      people began to be dissatisfied with the Barons, because they did not do
      enough for them.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s chances seemed so good again at
      length, that he took heart enough&mdash;or caught it from his brother&mdash;to
      tell the Committee of Government that he abolished them&mdash;as to his
      oath, never mind that, the Pope said!&mdash;and to seize all the money in
      the Mint, and to shut himself up in the Tower of London.&nbsp; Here he was
      joined by his eldest son, Prince Edward; and, from the Tower, he made
      public a letter of the Pope&rsquo;s to the world in general, informing all
      men that he had been an excellent and just King for five-and-forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      As everybody knew he had been nothing of the sort, nobody cared much for
      this document.&nbsp; It so chanced that the proud Earl of Gloucester
      dying, was succeeded by his son; and that his son, instead of being the
      enemy of the Earl of Leicester, was (for the time) his friend.&nbsp; It
      fell out, therefore, that these two Earls joined their forces, took
      several of the Royal Castles in the country, and advanced as hard as they
      could on London.&nbsp; The London people, always opposed to the King,
      declared for them with great joy.&nbsp; The King himself remained shut up,
      not at all gloriously, in the Tower.&nbsp; Prince Edward made the best of
      his way to Windsor Castle.&nbsp; His mother, the Queen, attempted to
      follow him by water; but, the people seeing her barge rowing up the river,
      and hating her with all their hearts, ran to London Bridge, got together a
      quantity of stones and mud, and pelted the barge as it came through,
      crying furiously, &lsquo;Drown the Witch!&nbsp; Drown her!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      They were so near doing it, that the Mayor took the old lady under his
      protection, and shut her up in St. Paul&rsquo;s until the danger was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would require a great deal of writing on my part, and a great deal of
      reading on yours, to follow the King through his disputes with the Barons,
      and to follow the Barons through their disputes with one another&mdash;so
      I will make short work of it for both of us, and only relate the chief
      events that arose out of these quarrels.&nbsp; The good King of France was
      asked to decide between them.&nbsp; He gave it as his opinion that the
      King must maintain the Great Charter, and that the Barons must give up the
      Committee of Government, and all the rest that had been done by the
      Parliament at Oxford: which the Royalists, or King&rsquo;s party,
      scornfully called the Mad Parliament.&nbsp; The Barons declared that these
      were not fair terms, and they would not accept them.&nbsp; Then they
      caused the great bell of St. Paul&rsquo;s to be tolled, for the purpose of
      rousing up the London people, who armed themselves at the dismal sound and
      formed quite an army in the streets.&nbsp; I am sorry to say, however,
      that instead of falling upon the King&rsquo;s party with whom their
      quarrel was, they fell upon the miserable Jews, and killed at least five
      hundred of them.&nbsp; They pretended that some of these Jews were on the
      King&rsquo;s side, and that they kept hidden in their houses, for the
      destruction of the people, a certain terrible composition called Greek
      Fire, which could not be put out with water, but only burnt the fiercer
      for it.&nbsp; What they really did keep in their houses was money; and
      this their cruel enemies wanted, and this their cruel enemies took, like
      robbers and murderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Leicester put himself at the head of these Londoners and other
      forces, and followed the King to Lewes in Sussex, where he lay encamped
      with his army.&nbsp; Before giving the King&rsquo;s forces battle here,
      the Earl addressed his soldiers, and said that King Henry the Third had
      broken so many oaths, that he had become the enemy of God, and therefore
      they would wear white crosses on their breasts, as if they were arrayed,
      not against a fellow-Christian, but against a Turk.&nbsp; White-crossed
      accordingly, they rushed into the fight.&nbsp; They would have lost the
      day&mdash;the King having on his side all the foreigners in England: and,
      from Scotland, <span class="smcap">John Comyn</span>, <span class="smcap">John
      Baliol</span>, and <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>, with all their
      men&mdash;but for the impatience of <span class="smcap">Prince Edward</span>,
      who, in his hot desire to have vengeance on the people of London, threw
      the whole of his father&rsquo;s army into confusion.&nbsp; He was taken
      Prisoner; so was the King; so was the King&rsquo;s brother the King of the
      Romans; and five thousand Englishmen were left dead upon the bloody grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this success, the Pope excommunicated the Earl of Leicester: which
      neither the Earl nor the people cared at all about.&nbsp; The people loved
      him and supported him, and he became the real King; having all the power
      of the government in his own hands, though he was outwardly respectful to
      King Henry the Third, whom he took with him wherever he went, like a poor
      old limp court-card.&nbsp; He summoned a Parliament (in the year one
      thousand two hundred and sixty-five) which was the first Parliament in
      England that the people had any real share in electing; and he grew more
      and more in favour with the people every day, and they stood by him in
      whatever he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the other Barons, and particularly the Earl of Gloucester, who had
      become by this time as proud as his father, grew jealous of this powerful
      and popular Earl, who was proud too, and began to conspire against him.&nbsp;
      Since the battle of Lewes, Prince Edward had been kept as a hostage, and,
      though he was otherwise treated like a Prince, had never been allowed to
      go out without attendants appointed by the Earl of Leicester, who watched
      him.&nbsp; The conspiring Lords found means to propose to him, in secret,
      that they should assist him to escape, and should make him their leader;
      to which he very heartily consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on a day that was agreed upon, he said to his attendants after dinner
      (being then at Hereford), &lsquo;I should like to ride on horseback, this
      fine afternoon, a little way into the country.&rsquo;&nbsp; As they, too,
      thought it would be very pleasant to have a canter in the sunshine, they
      all rode out of the town together in a gay little troop.&nbsp; When they
      came to a fine level piece of turf, the Prince fell to comparing their
      horses one with another, and offering bets that one was faster than
      another; and the attendants, suspecting no harm, rode galloping matches
      until their horses were quite tired.&nbsp; The Prince rode no matches
      himself, but looked on from his saddle, and staked his money.&nbsp; Thus
      they passed the whole merry afternoon.&nbsp; Now, the sun was setting, and
      they were all going slowly up a hill, the Prince&rsquo;s horse very fresh
      and all the other horses very weary, when a strange rider mounted on a
      grey steed appeared at the top of the hill, and waved his hat.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;What does the fellow mean?&rsquo; said the attendants one to
      another.&nbsp; The Prince answered on the instant by setting spurs to his
      horse, dashing away at his utmost speed, joining the man, riding into the
      midst of a little crowd of horsemen who were then seen waiting under some
      trees, and who closed around him; and so he departed in a cloud of dust,
      leaving the road empty of all but the baffled attendants, who sat looking
      at one another, while their horses drooped their ears and panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince joined the Earl of Gloucester at Ludlow.&nbsp; The Earl of
      Leicester, with a part of the army and the stupid old King, was at
      Hereford.&nbsp; One of the Earl of Leicester&rsquo;s sons, Simon de
      Montfort, with another part of the army, was in Sussex.&nbsp; To prevent
      these two parts from uniting was the Prince&rsquo;s first object.&nbsp; He
      attacked Simon de Montfort by night, defeated him, seized his banners and
      treasure, and forced him into Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, which
      belonged to his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father, the Earl of Leicester, in the meanwhile, not knowing what had
      happened, marched out of Hereford, with his part of the army and the King,
      to meet him.&nbsp; He came, on a bright morning in August, to Evesham,
      which is watered by the pleasant river Avon.&nbsp; Looking rather
      anxiously across the prospect towards Kenilworth, he saw his own banners
      advancing; and his face brightened with joy.&nbsp; But, it clouded darkly
      when he presently perceived that the banners were captured, and in the
      enemy&rsquo;s hands; and he said, &lsquo;It is over.&nbsp; The Lord have
      mercy on our souls, for our bodies are Prince Edward&rsquo;s!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He fought like a true Knight, nevertheless.&nbsp; When his horse was
      killed under him, he fought on foot.&nbsp; It was a fierce battle, and the
      dead lay in heaps everywhere.&nbsp; The old King, stuck up in a suit of
      armour on a big war-horse, which didn&rsquo;t mind him at all, and which
      carried him into all sorts of places where he didn&rsquo;t want to go, got
      into everybody&rsquo;s way, and very nearly got knocked on the head by one
      of his son&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; But he managed to pipe out, &lsquo;I am
      Harry of Winchester!&rsquo; and the Prince, who heard him, seized his
      bridle, and took him out of peril.&nbsp; The Earl of Leicester still
      fought bravely, until his best son Henry was killed, and the bodies of his
      best friends choked his path; and then he fell, still fighting, sword in
      hand.&nbsp; They mangled his body, and sent it as a present to a noble
      lady&mdash;but a very unpleasant lady, I should think&mdash;who was the
      wife of his worst enemy.&nbsp; They could not mangle his memory in the
      minds of the faithful people, though.&nbsp; Many years afterwards, they
      loved him more than ever, and regarded him as a Saint, and always spoke of
      him as &lsquo;Sir Simon the Righteous.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And even though he was dead, the cause for which he had fought still
      lived, and was strong, and forced itself upon the King in the very hour of
      victory.&nbsp; Henry found himself obliged to respect the Great Charter,
      however much he hated it, and to make laws similar to the laws of the
      Great Earl of Leicester, and to be moderate and forgiving towards the
      people at last&mdash;even towards the people of London, who had so long
      opposed him.&nbsp; There were more risings before all this was done, but
      they were set at rest by these means, and Prince Edward did his best in
      all things to restore peace.&nbsp; One Sir Adam de Gourdon was the last
      dissatisfied knight in arms; but, the Prince vanquished him in single
      combat, in a wood, and nobly gave him his life, and became his friend,
      instead of slaying him.&nbsp; Sir Adam was not ungrateful.&nbsp; He ever
      afterwards remained devoted to his generous conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the troubles of the Kingdom were thus calmed, Prince Edward and his
      cousin Henry took the Cross, and went away to the Holy Land, with many
      English Lords and Knights.&nbsp; Four years afterwards the King of the
      Romans died, and, next year (one thousand two hundred and seventy-two),
      his brother the weak King of England died.&nbsp; He was sixty-eight years
      old then, and had reigned fifty-six years.&nbsp; He was as much of a King
      in death, as he had ever been in life.&nbsp; He was the mere pale shadow
      of a King at all times.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIRST, CALLED LONGSHANKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was now the year of our Lord one thousand two hundred and seventy-two;
      and Prince Edward, the heir to the throne, being away in the Holy Land,
      knew nothing of his father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The Barons, however,
      proclaimed him King, immediately after the Royal funeral; and the people
      very willingly consented, since most men knew too well by this time what
      the horrors of a contest for the crown were.&nbsp; So King Edward the
      First, called, in a not very complimentary manner, <span class="smcap">Longshanks</span>,
      because of the slenderness of his legs, was peacefully accepted by the
      English Nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His legs had need to be strong, however long and thin they were; for they
      had to support him through many difficulties on the fiery sands of Asia,
      where his small force of soldiers fainted, died, deserted, and seemed to
      melt away.&nbsp; But his prowess made light of it, and he said, &lsquo;I
      will go on, if I go on with no other follower than my groom!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A Prince of this spirit gave the Turks a deal of trouble.&nbsp; He stormed
      Nazareth, at which place, of all places on earth, I am sorry to relate, he
      made a frightful slaughter of innocent people; and then he went to Acre,
      where he got a truce of ten years from the Sultan.&nbsp; He had very
      nearly lost his life in Acre, through the treachery of a Saracen Noble,
      called the Emir of Jaffa, who, making the pretence that he had some idea
      of turning Christian and wanted to know all about that religion, sent a
      trusty messenger to Edward very often&mdash;with a dagger in his sleeve.&nbsp;
      At last, one Friday in Whitsun week, when it was very hot, and all the
      sandy prospect lay beneath the blazing sun, burnt up like a great overdone
      biscuit, and Edward was lying on a couch, dressed for coolness in only a
      loose robe, the messenger, with his chocolate-coloured face and his bright
      dark eyes and white teeth, came creeping in with a letter, and kneeled
      down like a tame tiger.&nbsp; But, the moment Edward stretched out his
      hand to take the letter, the tiger made a spring at his heart.&nbsp; He
      was quick, but Edward was quick too.&nbsp; He seized the traitor by his
      chocolate throat, threw him to the ground, and slew him with the very
      dagger he had drawn.&nbsp; The weapon had struck Edward in the arm, and
      although the wound itself was slight, it threatened to be mortal, for the
      blade of the dagger had been smeared with poison.&nbsp; Thanks, however,
      to a better surgeon than was often to be found in those times, and to some
      wholesome herbs, and above all, to his faithful wife, <span class="smcap">Eleanor</span>,
      who devotedly nursed him, and is said by some to have sucked the poison
      from the wound with her own red lips (which I am very willing to believe),
      Edward soon recovered and was sound again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the King his father had sent entreaties to him to return home, he now
      began the journey.&nbsp; He had got as far as Italy, when he met
      messengers who brought him intelligence of the King&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
      Hearing that all was quiet at home, he made no haste to return to his own
      dominions, but paid a visit to the Pope, and went in state through various
      Italian Towns, where he was welcomed with acclamations as a mighty
      champion of the Cross from the Holy Land, and where he received presents
      of purple mantles and prancing horses, and went along in great triumph.&nbsp;
      The shouting people little knew that he was the last English monarch who
      would ever embark in a crusade, or that within twenty years every conquest
      which the Christians had made in the Holy Land at the cost of so much
      blood, would be won back by the Turks.&nbsp; But all this came to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain in France, called
      Ch&acirc;lons.&nbsp; When the King was coming towards this place on his
      way to England, a wily French Lord, called the Count of Ch&acirc;lons,
      sent him a polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a fair
      tournament with the Count and <i>his</i> knights, and make a day of it
      with sword and lance.&nbsp; It was represented to the King that the Count
      of Ch&acirc;lons was not to be trusted, and that, instead of a holiday
      fight for mere show and in good humour, he secretly meant a real battle,
      in which the English should be defeated by superior force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, however, nothing afraid, went to the appointed place on the
      appointed day with a thousand followers.&nbsp; When the Count came with
      two thousand and attacked the English in earnest, the English rushed at
      them with such valour that the Count&rsquo;s men and the Count&rsquo;s
      horses soon began to be tumbled down all over the field.&nbsp; The Count
      himself seized the King round the neck, but the King tumbled <i>him</i>
      out of his saddle in return for the compliment, and, jumping from his own
      horse, and standing over him, beat away at his iron armour like a
      blacksmith hammering on his anvil.&nbsp; Even when the Count owned himself
      defeated and offered his sword, the King would not do him the honour to
      take it, but made him yield it up to a common soldier.&nbsp; There had
      been such fury shown in this fight, that it was afterwards called the
      little Battle of Ch&acirc;lons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English were very well disposed to be proud of their King after these
      adventures; so, when he landed at Dover in the year one thousand two
      hundred and seventy-four (being then thirty-six years old), and went on to
      Westminster where he and his good Queen were crowned with great
      magnificence, splendid rejoicings took place.&nbsp; For the
      coronation-feast there were provided, among other eatables, four hundred
      oxen, four hundred sheep, four hundred and fifty pigs, eighteen wild
      boars, three hundred flitches of bacon, and twenty thousand fowls.&nbsp;
      The fountains and conduits in the street flowed with red and white wine
      instead of water; the rich citizens hung silks and cloths of the brightest
      colours out of their windows to increase the beauty of the show, and threw
      out gold and silver by whole handfuls to make scrambles for the crowd.&nbsp;
      In short, there was such eating and drinking, such music and capering,
      such a ringing of bells and tossing of caps, such a shouting, and singing,
      and revelling, as the narrow overhanging streets of old London City had
      not witnessed for many a long day.&nbsp; All the people were merry except
      the poor Jews, who, trembling within their houses, and scarcely daring to
      peep out, began to foresee that they would have to find the money for this
      joviality sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To dismiss this sad subject of the Jews for the present, I am sorry to add
      that in this reign they were most unmercifully pillaged.&nbsp; They were
      hanged in great numbers, on accusations of having clipped the King&rsquo;s
      coin&mdash;which all kinds of people had done.&nbsp; They were heavily
      taxed; they were disgracefully badged; they were, on one day, thirteen
      years after the coronation, taken up with their wives and children and
      thrown into beastly prisons, until they purchased their release by paying
      to the King twelve thousand pounds.&nbsp; Finally, every kind of property
      belonging to them was seized by the King, except so little as would defray
      the charge of their taking themselves away into foreign countries.&nbsp;
      Many years elapsed before the hope of gain induced any of their race to
      return to England, where they had been treated so heartlessly and had
      suffered so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      If King Edward the First had been as bad a king to Christians as he was to
      Jews, he would have been bad indeed.&nbsp; But he was, in general, a wise
      and great monarch, under whom the country much improved.&nbsp; He had no
      love for the Great Charter&mdash;few Kings had, through many, many years&mdash;but
      he had high qualities.&nbsp; The first bold object which he conceived when
      he came home, was, to unite under one Sovereign England, Scotland, and
      Wales; the two last of which countries had each a little king of its own,
      about whom the people were always quarrelling and fighting, and making a
      prodigious disturbance&mdash;a great deal more than he was worth.&nbsp; In
      the course of King Edward&rsquo;s reign he was engaged, besides, in a war
      with France.&nbsp; To make these quarrels clearer, we will separate their
      histories and take them thus.&nbsp; Wales, first.&nbsp; France, second.&nbsp;
      Scotland, third.

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Llewellyn</span> was the Prince of Wales.&nbsp; He had
      been on the side of the Barons in the reign of the stupid old King, but
      had afterwards sworn allegiance to him.&nbsp; When King Edward came to the
      throne, Llewellyn was required to swear allegiance to him also; which he
      refused to do.&nbsp; The King, being crowned and in his own dominions,
      three times more required Llewellyn to come and do homage; and three times
      more Llewellyn said he would rather not.&nbsp; He was going to be married
      to <span class="smcap">Eleanor de Montfort</span>, a young lady of the
      family mentioned in the last reign; and it chanced that this young lady,
      coming from France with her youngest brother, <span class="smcap">Emeric</span>,
      was taken by an English ship, and was ordered by the English King to be
      detained.&nbsp; Upon this, the quarrel came to a head.&nbsp; The King
      went, with his fleet, to the coast of Wales, where, so encompassing
      Llewellyn, that he could only take refuge in the bleak mountain region of
      Snowdon in which no provisions could reach him, he was soon starved into
      an apology, and into a treaty of peace, and into paying the expenses of
      the war.&nbsp; The King, however, forgave him some of the hardest
      conditions of the treaty, and consented to his marriage.&nbsp; And he now
      thought he had reduced Wales to obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Welsh, although they were naturally a gentle, quiet, pleasant
      people, who liked to receive strangers in their cottages among the
      mountains, and to set before them with free hospitality whatever they had
      to eat and drink, and to play to them on their harps, and sing their
      native ballads to them, were a people of great spirit when their blood was
      up.&nbsp; Englishmen, after this affair, began to be insolent in Wales,
      and to assume the air of masters; and the Welsh pride could not bear it.&nbsp;
      Moreover, they believed in that unlucky old Merlin, some of whose unlucky
      old prophecies somebody always seemed doomed to remember when there was a
      chance of its doing harm; and just at this time some blind old gentleman
      with a harp and a long white beard, who was an excellent person, but had
      become of an unknown age and tedious, burst out with a declaration that
      Merlin had predicted that when English money had become round, a Prince of
      Wales would be crowned in London.&nbsp; Now, King Edward had recently
      forbidden the English penny to be cut into halves and quarters for
      halfpence and farthings, and had actually introduced a round coin;
      therefore, the Welsh people said this was the time Merlin meant, and rose
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward had bought over <span class="smcap">Prince David</span>,
      Llewellyn&rsquo;s brother, by heaping favours upon him; but he was the
      first to revolt, being perhaps troubled in his conscience.&nbsp; One
      stormy night, he surprised the Castle of Hawarden, in possession of which
      an English nobleman had been left; killed the whole garrison, and carried
      off the nobleman a prisoner to Snowdon.&nbsp; Upon this, the Welsh people
      rose like one man.&nbsp; King Edward, with his army, marching from
      Worcester to the Menai Strait, crossed it&mdash;near to where the
      wonderful tubular iron bridge now, in days so different, makes a passage
      for railway trains&mdash;by a bridge of boats that enabled forty men to
      march abreast.&nbsp; He subdued the Island of Anglesea, and sent his men
      forward to observe the enemy.&nbsp; The sudden appearance of the Welsh
      created a panic among them, and they fell back to the bridge.&nbsp; The
      tide had in the meantime risen and separated the boats; the Welsh pursuing
      them, they were driven into the sea, and there they sunk, in their heavy
      iron armour, by thousands.&nbsp; After this victory Llewellyn, helped by
      the severe winter-weather of Wales, gained another battle; but the King
      ordering a portion of his English army to advance through South Wales, and
      catch him between two foes, and Llewellyn bravely turning to meet this new
      enemy, he was surprised and killed&mdash;very meanly, for he was unarmed
      and defenceless.&nbsp; His head was struck off and sent to London, where
      it was fixed upon the Tower, encircled with a wreath, some say of ivy,
      some say of willow, some say of silver, to make it look like a ghastly
      coin in ridicule of the prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      David, however, still held out for six months, though eagerly sought after
      by the King, and hunted by his own countrymen.&nbsp; One of them finally
      betrayed him with his wife and children.&nbsp; He was sentenced to be
      hanged, drawn, and quartered; and from that time this became the
      established punishment of Traitors in England&mdash;a punishment wholly
      without excuse, as being revolting, vile, and cruel, after its object is
      dead; and which has no sense in it, as its only real degradation (and that
      nothing can blot out) is to the country that permits on any consideration
      such abominable barbarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wales was now subdued.&nbsp; The Queen giving birth to a young prince in
      the Castle of Carnarvon, the King showed him to the Welsh people as their
      countryman, and called him Prince of Wales; a title that has ever since
      been borne by the heir-apparent to the English throne&mdash;which that
      little Prince soon became, by the death of his elder brother.&nbsp; The
      King did better things for the Welsh than that, by improving their laws
      and encouraging their trade.&nbsp; Disturbances still took place, chiefly
      occasioned by the avarice and pride of the English Lords, on whom Welsh
      lands and castles had been bestowed; but they were subdued, and the
      country never rose again.&nbsp; There is a legend that to prevent the
      people from being incited to rebellion by the songs of their bards and
      harpers, Edward had them all put to death.&nbsp; Some of them may have
      fallen among other men who held out against the King; but this general
      slaughter is, I think, a fancy of the harpers themselves, who, I dare say,
      made a song about it many years afterwards, and sang it by the Welsh
      firesides until it came to be believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreign war of the reign of Edward the First arose in this way.&nbsp;
      The crews of two vessels, one a Norman ship, and the other an English
      ship, happened to go to the same place in their boats to fill their casks
      with fresh water.&nbsp; Being rough angry fellows, they began to quarrel,
      and then to fight&mdash;the English with their fists; the Normans with
      their knives&mdash;and, in the fight, a Norman was killed.&nbsp; The
      Norman crew, instead of revenging themselves upon those English sailors
      with whom they had quarrelled (who were too strong for them, I suspect),
      took to their ship again in a great rage, attacked the first English ship
      they met, laid hold of an unoffending merchant who happened to be on
      board, and brutally hanged him in the rigging of their own vessel with a
      dog at his feet.&nbsp; This so enraged the English sailors that there was
      no restraining them; and whenever, and wherever, English sailors met
      Norman sailors, they fell upon each other tooth and nail.&nbsp; The Irish
      and Dutch sailors took part with the English; the French and Genoese
      sailors helped the Normans; and thus the greater part of the mariners
      sailing over the sea became, in their way, as violent and raging as the
      sea itself when it is disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward&rsquo;s fame had been so high abroad that he had been chosen
      to decide a difference between France and another foreign power, and had
      lived upon the Continent three years.&nbsp; At first, neither he nor the
      French King <span class="smcap">Philip</span> (the good Louis had been
      dead some time) interfered in these quarrels; but when a fleet of eighty
      English ships engaged and utterly defeated a Norman fleet of two hundred,
      in a pitched battle fought round a ship at anchor, in which no quarter was
      given, the matter became too serious to be passed over.&nbsp; King Edward,
      as Duke of Guienne, was summoned to present himself before the King of
      France, at Paris, and answer for the damage done by his sailor subjects.&nbsp;
      At first, he sent the Bishop of London as his representative, and then his
      brother <span class="smcap">Edmund</span>, who was married to the French
      Queen&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; I am afraid Edmund was an easy man, and
      allowed himself to be talked over by his charming relations, the French
      court ladies; at all events, he was induced to give up his brother&rsquo;s
      dukedom for forty days&mdash;as a mere form, the French King said, to
      satisfy his honour&mdash;and he was so very much astonished, when the time
      was out, to find that the French King had no idea of giving it up again,
      that I should not wonder if it hastened his death: which soon took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward was a King to win his foreign dukedom back again, if it could
      be won by energy and valour.&nbsp; He raised a large army, renounced his
      allegiance as Duke of Guienne, and crossed the sea to carry war into
      France.&nbsp; Before any important battle was fought, however, a truce was
      agreed upon for two years; and in the course of that time, the Pope
      effected a reconciliation.&nbsp; King Edward, who was now a widower,
      having lost his affectionate and good wife, Eleanor, married the French
      King&rsquo;s sister, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>; and the Prince
      of Wales was contracted to the French King&rsquo;s daughter <span
      class="smcap">Isabella</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of bad things, good things sometimes arise.&nbsp; Out of this hanging
      of the innocent merchant, and the bloodshed and strife it caused, there
      came to be established one of the greatest powers that the English people
      now possess.&nbsp; The preparations for the war being very expensive, and
      King Edward greatly wanting money, and being very arbitrary in his ways of
      raising it, some of the Barons began firmly to oppose him.&nbsp; Two of
      them, in particular, <span class="smcap">Humphrey Bohun</span>, Earl of
      Hereford, and <span class="smcap">Roger Bigod</span>, Earl of Norfolk,
      were so stout against him, that they maintained he had no right to command
      them to head his forces in Guienne, and flatly refused to go there.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;By Heaven, Sir Earl,&rsquo; said the King to the Earl of Hereford,
      in a great passion, &lsquo;you shall either go or be hanged!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      &lsquo;By Heaven, Sir King,&rsquo; replied the Earl, &lsquo;I will neither
      go nor yet will I be hanged!&rsquo; and both he and the other Earl
      sturdily left the court, attended by many Lords.&nbsp; The King tried
      every means of raising money.&nbsp; He taxed the clergy, in spite of all
      the Pope said to the contrary; and when they refused to pay, reduced them
      to submission, by saying Very well, then they had no claim upon the
      government for protection, and any man might plunder them who would&mdash;which
      a good many men were very ready to do, and very readily did, and which the
      clergy found too losing a game to be played at long.&nbsp; He seized all
      the wool and leather in the hands of the merchants, promising to pay for
      it some fine day; and he set a tax upon the exportation of wool, which was
      so unpopular among the traders that it was called &lsquo;The evil toll.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      But all would not do.&nbsp; The Barons, led by those two great Earls,
      declared any taxes imposed without the consent of Parliament, unlawful;
      and the Parliament refused to impose taxes, until the King should confirm
      afresh the two Great Charters, and should solemnly declare in writing,
      that there was no power in the country to raise money from the people,
      evermore, but the power of Parliament representing all ranks of the
      people.&nbsp; The King was very unwilling to diminish his own power by
      allowing this great privilege in the Parliament; but there was no help for
      it, and he at last complied.&nbsp; We shall come to another King
      by-and-by, who might have saved his head from rolling off, if he had
      profited by this example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people gained other benefits in Parliament from the good sense and
      wisdom of this King.&nbsp; Many of the laws were much improved; provision
      was made for the greater safety of travellers, and the apprehension of
      thieves and murderers; the priests were prevented from holding too much
      land, and so becoming too powerful; and Justices of the Peace were first
      appointed (though not at first under that name) in various parts of the
      country.

    </p>
    <p>
      And now we come to Scotland, which was the great and lasting trouble of
      the reign of King Edward the First.
    </p>
    <p>
      About thirteen years after King Edward&rsquo;s coronation, Alexander the
      Third, the King of Scotland, died of a fall from his horse.&nbsp; He had
      been married to Margaret, King Edward&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; All their
      children being dead, the Scottish crown became the right of a young
      Princess only eight years old, the daughter of <span class="smcap">Eric</span>,
      King of Norway, who had married a daughter of the deceased sovereign.&nbsp;
      King Edward proposed, that the Maiden of Norway, as this Princess was
      called, should be engaged to be married to his eldest son; but,
      unfortunately, as she was coming over to England she fell sick, and
      landing on one of the Orkney Islands, died there.&nbsp; A great commotion
      immediately began in Scotland, where as many as thirteen noisy claimants
      to the vacant throne started up and made a general confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward being much renowned for his sagacity and justice, it seems to
      have been agreed to refer the dispute to him.&nbsp; He accepted the trust,
      and went, with an army, to the Border-land where England and Scotland
      joined.&nbsp; There, he called upon the Scottish gentlemen to meet him at
      the Castle of Norham, on the English side of the river Tweed; and to that
      Castle they came.&nbsp; But, before he would take any step in the
      business, he required those Scottish gentlemen, one and all, to do homage
      to him as their superior Lord; and when they hesitated, he said, &lsquo;By
      holy Edward, whose crown I wear, I will have my rights, or I will die in
      maintaining them!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Scottish gentlemen, who had not
      expected this, were disconcerted, and asked for three weeks to think about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the three weeks, another meeting took place, on a green
      plain on the Scottish side of the river.&nbsp; Of all the competitors for
      the Scottish throne, there were only two who had any real claim, in right
      of their near kindred to the Royal Family.&nbsp; These were <span
      class="smcap">John Baliol</span> and <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>:
      and the right was, I have no doubt, on the side of John Baliol.&nbsp; At
      this particular meeting John Baliol was not present, but Robert Bruce was;
      and on Robert Bruce being formally asked whether he acknowledged the King
      of England for his superior lord, he answered, plainly and distinctly,
      Yes, he did.&nbsp; Next day, John Baliol appeared, and said the same.&nbsp;
      This point settled, some arrangements were made for inquiring into their
      titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inquiry occupied a pretty long time&mdash;more than a year.&nbsp;
      While it was going on, King Edward took the opportunity of making a
      journey through Scotland, and calling upon the Scottish people of all
      degrees to acknowledge themselves his vassals, or be imprisoned until they
      did.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, Commissioners were appointed to conduct the
      inquiry, a Parliament was held at Berwick about it, the two claimants were
      heard at full length, and there was a vast amount of talking.&nbsp; At
      last, in the great hall of the Castle of Berwick, the King gave judgment
      in favour of John Baliol: who, consenting to receive his crown by the King
      of England&rsquo;s favour and permission, was crowned at Scone, in an old
      stone chair which had been used for ages in the abbey there, at the
      coronations of Scottish Kings.&nbsp; Then, King Edward caused the great
      seal of Scotland, used since the late King&rsquo;s death, to be broken in
      four pieces, and placed in the English Treasury; and considered that he
      now had Scotland (according to the common saying) under his thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotland had a strong will of its own yet, however.&nbsp; King Edward,
      determined that the Scottish King should not forget he was his vassal,
      summoned him repeatedly to come and defend himself and his judges before
      the English Parliament when appeals from the decisions of Scottish courts
      of justice were being heard.&nbsp; At length, John Baliol, who had no
      great heart of his own, had so much heart put into him by the brave spirit
      of the Scottish people, who took this as a national insult, that he
      refused to come any more.&nbsp; Thereupon, the King further required him
      to help him in his war abroad (which was then in progress), and to give
      up, as security for his good behaviour in future, the three strong
      Scottish Castles of Jedburgh, Roxburgh, and Berwick.&nbsp; Nothing of this
      being done; on the contrary, the Scottish people concealing their King
      among their mountains in the Highlands and showing a determination to
      resist; Edward marched to Berwick with an army of thirty thousand foot,
      and four thousand horse; took the Castle, and slew its whole garrison, and
      the inhabitants of the town as well&mdash;men, women, and children.&nbsp;
      <span class="smcap">Lord Warrenne</span>, Earl of Surrey, then went on to
      the Castle of Dunbar, before which a battle was fought, and the whole
      Scottish army defeated with great slaughter.&nbsp; The victory being
      complete, the Earl of Surrey was left as guardian of Scotland; the
      principal offices in that kingdom were given to Englishmen; the more
      powerful Scottish Nobles were obliged to come and live in England; the
      Scottish crown and sceptre were brought away; and even the old stone chair
      was carried off and placed in Westminster Abbey, where you may see it now.&nbsp;
      Baliol had the Tower of London lent him for a residence, with permission
      to range about within a circle of twenty miles.&nbsp; Three years
      afterwards he was allowed to go to Normandy, where he had estates, and
      where he passed the remaining six years of his life: far more happily, I
      dare say, than he had lived for a long while in angry Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there was, in the West of Scotland, a gentleman of small fortune,
      named <span class="smcap">William Wallace</span>, the second son of a
      Scottish knight.&nbsp; He was a man of great size and great strength; he
      was very brave and daring; when he spoke to a body of his countrymen, he
      could rouse them in a wonderful manner by the power of his burning words;
      he loved Scotland dearly, and he hated England with his utmost might.&nbsp;
      The domineering conduct of the English who now held the places of trust in
      Scotland made them as intolerable to the proud Scottish people as they had
      been, under similar circumstances, to the Welsh; and no man in all
      Scotland regarded them with so much smothered rage as William Wallace.&nbsp;
      One day, an Englishman in office, little knowing what he was, affronted <i>him</i>.&nbsp;
      Wallace instantly struck him dead, and taking refuge among the rocks and
      hills, and there joining with his countryman, <span class="smcap">Sir
      William Douglas</span>, who was also in arms against King Edward, became
      the most resolute and undaunted champion of a people struggling for their
      independence that ever lived upon the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English Guardian of the Kingdom fled before him, and, thus encouraged,
      the Scottish people revolted everywhere, and fell upon the English without
      mercy.&nbsp; The Earl of Surrey, by the King&rsquo;s commands, raised all
      the power of the Border-counties, and two English armies poured into
      Scotland.&nbsp; Only one Chief, in the face of those armies, stood by
      Wallace, who, with a force of forty thousand men, awaited the invaders at
      a place on the river Forth, within two miles of Stirling.&nbsp; Across the
      river there was only one poor wooden bridge, called the bridge of Kildean&mdash;so
      narrow, that but two men could cross it abreast.&nbsp; With his eyes upon
      this bridge, Wallace posted the greater part of his men among some rising
      grounds, and waited calmly.&nbsp; When the English army came up on the
      opposite bank of the river, messengers were sent forward to offer terms.&nbsp;
      Wallace sent them back with a defiance, in the name of the freedom of
      Scotland.&nbsp; Some of the officers of the Earl of Surrey in command of
      the English, with <i>their</i> eyes also on the bridge, advised him to be
      discreet and not hasty.&nbsp; He, however, urged to immediate battle by
      some other officers, and particularly by <span class="smcap">Cressingham</span>,
      King Edward&rsquo;s treasurer, and a rash man, gave the word of command to
      advance.&nbsp; One thousand English crossed the bridge, two abreast; the
      Scottish troops were as motionless as stone images.&nbsp; Two thousand
      English crossed; three thousand, four thousand, five.&nbsp; Not a feather,
      all this time, had been seen to stir among the Scottish bonnets.&nbsp;
      Now, they all fluttered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Forward, one party, to the foot of
      the Bridge!&rsquo; cried Wallace, &lsquo;and let no more English cross!&nbsp;
      The rest, down with me on the five thousand who have come over, and cut
      them all to pieces!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was done, in the sight of the whole
      remainder of the English army, who could give no help.&nbsp; Cressingham
      himself was killed, and the Scotch made whips for their horses of his
      skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward was abroad at this time, and during the successes on the
      Scottish side which followed, and which enabled bold Wallace to win the
      whole country back again, and even to ravage the English borders.&nbsp;
      But, after a few winter months, the King returned, and took the field with
      more than his usual energy.&nbsp; One night, when a kick from his horse as
      they both lay on the ground together broke two of his ribs, and a cry
      arose that he was killed, he leaped into his saddle, regardless of the
      pain he suffered, and rode through the camp.&nbsp; Day then appearing, he
      gave the word (still, of course, in that bruised and aching state)
      Forward! and led his army on to near Falkirk, where the Scottish forces
      were seen drawn up on some stony ground, behind a morass.&nbsp; Here, he
      defeated Wallace, and killed fifteen thousand of his men.&nbsp; With the
      shattered remainder, Wallace drew back to Stirling; but, being pursued,
      set fire to the town that it might give no help to the English, and
      escaped.&nbsp; The inhabitants of Perth afterwards set fire to their
      houses for the same reason, and the King, unable to find provisions, was
      forced to withdraw his army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>, the grandson of him who
      had disputed the Scottish crown with Baliol, was now in arms against the
      King (that elder Bruce being dead), and also <span class="smcap">John
      Comyn</span>, Baliol&rsquo;s nephew.&nbsp; These two young men might agree
      in opposing Edward, but could agree in nothing else, as they were rivals
      for the throne of Scotland.&nbsp; Probably it was because they knew this,
      and knew what troubles must arise even if they could hope to get the
      better of the great English King, that the principal Scottish people
      applied to the Pope for his interference.&nbsp; The Pope, on the principle
      of losing nothing for want of trying to get it, very coolly claimed that
      Scotland belonged to him; but this was a little too much, and the
      Parliament in a friendly manner told him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring time of the year one thousand three hundred and three, the
      King sent <span class="smcap">Sir John Segrave</span>, whom he made
      Governor of Scotland, with twenty thousand men, to reduce the rebels.&nbsp;
      Sir John was not as careful as he should have been, but encamped at
      Rosslyn, near Edinburgh, with his army divided into three parts.&nbsp; The
      Scottish forces saw their advantage; fell on each part separately;
      defeated each; and killed all the prisoners.&nbsp; Then, came the King
      himself once more, as soon as a great army could be raised; he passed
      through the whole north of Scotland, laying waste whatsoever came in his
      way; and he took up his winter quarters at Dunfermline.&nbsp; The Scottish
      cause now looked so hopeless, that Comyn and the other nobles made
      submission and received their pardons.&nbsp; Wallace alone stood out.&nbsp;
      He was invited to surrender, though on no distinct pledge that his life
      should be spared; but he still defied the ireful King, and lived among the
      steep crags of the Highland glens, where the eagles made their nests, and
      where the mountain torrents roared, and the white snow was deep, and the
      bitter winds blew round his unsheltered head, as he lay through many a
      pitch-dark night wrapped up in his plaid.&nbsp; Nothing could break his
      spirit; nothing could lower his courage; nothing could induce him to
      forget or to forgive his country&rsquo;s wrongs.&nbsp; Even when the
      Castle of Stirling, which had long held out, was besieged by the King with
      every kind of military engine then in use; even when the lead upon
      cathedral roofs was taken down to help to make them; even when the King,
      though an old man, commanded in the siege as if he were a youth, being so
      resolved to conquer; even when the brave garrison (then found with
      amazement to be not two hundred people, including several ladies) were
      starved and beaten out and were made to submit on their knees, and with
      every form of disgrace that could aggravate their sufferings; even then,
      when there was not a ray of hope in Scotland, William Wallace was as proud
      and firm as if he had beheld the powerful and relentless Edward lying dead
      at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who betrayed William Wallace in the end, is not quite certain.&nbsp; That
      he was betrayed&mdash;probably by an attendant&mdash;is too true.&nbsp; He
      was taken to the Castle of Dumbarton, under <span class="smcap">Sir John
      Menteith</span>, and thence to London, where the great fame of his bravery
      and resolution attracted immense concourses of people to behold him.&nbsp;
      He was tried in Westminster Hall, with a crown of laurel on his head&mdash;it
      is supposed because he was reported to have said that he ought to wear, or
      that he would wear, a crown there and was found guilty as a robber, a
      murderer, and a traitor.&nbsp; What they called a robber (he said to those
      who tried him) he was, because he had taken spoil from the King&rsquo;s
      men.&nbsp; What they called a murderer, he was, because he had slain an
      insolent Englishman.&nbsp; What they called a traitor, he was not, for he
      had never sworn allegiance to the King, and had ever scorned to do it.&nbsp;
      He was dragged at the tails of horses to West Smithfield, and there hanged
      on a high gallows, torn open before he was dead, beheaded, and quartered.&nbsp;
      His head was set upon a pole on London Bridge, his right arm was sent to
      Newcastle, his left arm to Berwick, his legs to Perth and Aberdeen.&nbsp;
      But, if King Edward had had his body cut into inches, and had sent every
      separate inch into a separate town, he could not have dispersed it half so
      far and wide as his fame.&nbsp; Wallace will be remembered in songs and
      stories, while there are songs and stories in the English tongue, and
      Scotland will hold him dear while her lakes and mountains last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Released from this dreaded enemy, the King made a fairer plan of
      Government for Scotland, divided the offices of honour among Scottish
      gentlemen and English gentlemen, forgave past offences, and thought, in
      his old age, that his work was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he deceived himself.&nbsp; Comyn and Bruce conspired, and made an
      appointment to meet at Dumfries, in the church of the Minorites.&nbsp;
      There is a story that Comyn was false to Bruce, and had informed against
      him to the King; that Bruce was warned of his danger and the necessity of
      flight, by receiving, one night as he sat at supper, from his friend the
      Earl of Gloucester, twelve pennies and a pair of spurs; that as he was
      riding angrily to keep his appointment (through a snow-storm, with his
      horse&rsquo;s shoes reversed that he might not be tracked), he met an
      evil-looking serving man, a messenger of Comyn, whom he killed, and
      concealed in whose dress he found letters that proved Comyn&rsquo;s
      treachery.&nbsp; However this may be, they were likely enough to quarrel
      in any case, being hot-headed rivals; and, whatever they quarrelled about,
      they certainly did quarrel in the church where they met, and Bruce drew
      his dagger and stabbed Comyn, who fell upon the pavement.&nbsp; When Bruce
      came out, pale and disturbed, the friends who were waiting for him asked
      what was the matter?&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I have killed Comyn,&rsquo; said
      he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You only think so?&rsquo; returned one of them; &lsquo;I
      will make sure!&rsquo; and going into the church, and finding him alive,
      stabbed him again and again.&nbsp; Knowing that the King would never
      forgive this new deed of violence, the party then declared Bruce King of
      Scotland: got him crowned at Scone&mdash;without the chair; and set up the
      rebellious standard once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King heard of it he kindled with fiercer anger than he had ever
      shown yet.&nbsp; He caused the Prince of Wales and two hundred and seventy
      of the young nobility to be knighted&mdash;the trees in the Temple Gardens
      were cut down to make room for their tents, and they watched their armour
      all night, according to the old usage: some in the Temple Church: some in
      Westminster Abbey&mdash;and at the public Feast which then took place, he
      swore, by Heaven, and by two swans covered with gold network which his
      minstrels placed upon the table, that he would avenge the death of Comyn,
      and would punish the false Bruce.&nbsp; And before all the company, he
      charged the Prince his son, in case that he should die before
      accomplishing his vow, not to bury him until it was fulfilled.&nbsp; Next
      morning the Prince and the rest of the young Knights rode away to the
      Border-country to join the English army; and the King, now weak and sick,
      followed in a horse-litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce, after losing a battle and undergoing many dangers and much misery,
      fled to Ireland, where he lay concealed through the winter.&nbsp; That
      winter, Edward passed in hunting down and executing Bruce&rsquo;s
      relations and adherents, sparing neither youth nor age, and showing no
      touch of pity or sign of mercy.&nbsp; In the following spring, Bruce
      reappeared and gained some victories.&nbsp; In these frays, both sides
      were grievously cruel.&nbsp; For instance&mdash;Bruce&rsquo;s two
      brothers, being taken captives desperately wounded, were ordered by the
      King to instant execution.&nbsp; Bruce&rsquo;s friend Sir John Douglas,
      taking his own Castle of Douglas out of the hands of an English Lord,
      roasted the dead bodies of the slaughtered garrison in a great fire made
      of every movable within it; which dreadful cookery his men called the
      Douglas Larder.&nbsp; Bruce, still successful, however, drove the Earl of
      Pembroke and the Earl of Gloucester into the Castle of Ayr and laid siege
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, who had been laid up all the winter, but had directed the army
      from his sick-bed, now advanced to Carlisle, and there, causing the litter
      in which he had travelled to be placed in the Cathedral as an offering to
      Heaven, mounted his horse once more, and for the last time.&nbsp; He was
      now sixty-nine years old, and had reigned thirty-five years.&nbsp; He was
      so ill, that in four days he could go no more than six miles; still, even
      at that pace, he went on and resolutely kept his face towards the Border.&nbsp;
      At length, he lay down at the village of Burgh-upon-Sands; and there,
      telling those around him to impress upon the Prince that he was to
      remember his father&rsquo;s vow, and was never to rest until he had
      thoroughly subdued Scotland, he yielded up his last breath.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SECOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      King Edward the Second, the first Prince of Wales, was twenty-three years
      old when his father died.&nbsp; There was a certain favourite of his, a
      young man from Gascony, named <span class="smcap">Piers Gaveston</span>,
      of whom his father had so much disapproved that he had ordered him out of
      England, and had made his son swear by the side of his sick-bed, never to
      bring him back.&nbsp; But, the Prince no sooner found himself King, than
      he broke his oath, as so many other Princes and Kings did (they were far
      too ready to take oaths), and sent for his dear friend immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this same Gaveston was handsome enough, but was a reckless, insolent,
      audacious fellow.&nbsp; He was detested by the proud English Lords: not
      only because he had such power over the King, and made the Court such a
      dissipated place, but, also, because he could ride better than they at
      tournaments, and was used, in his impudence, to cut very bad jokes on
      them; calling one, the old hog; another, the stage-player; another, the
      Jew; another, the black dog of Ardenne.&nbsp; This was as poor wit as need
      be, but it made those Lords very wroth; and the surly Earl of Warwick, who
      was the black dog, swore that the time should come when Piers Gaveston
      should feel the black dog&rsquo;s teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not come yet, however, nor did it seem to be coming.&nbsp; The King
      made him Earl of Cornwall, and gave him vast riches; and, when the King
      went over to France to marry the French Princess, <span class="smcap">Isabella</span>,
      daughter of <span class="smcap">Philip le Bel</span>: who was said to be
      the most beautiful woman in the world: he made Gaveston, Regent of the
      Kingdom.&nbsp; His splendid marriage-ceremony in the Church of Our Lady at
      Boulogne, where there were four Kings and three Queens present (quite a
      pack of Court Cards, for I dare say the Knaves were not wanting), being
      over, he seemed to care little or nothing for his beautiful wife; but was
      wild with impatience to meet Gaveston again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he landed at home, he paid no attention to anybody else, but ran into
      the favourite&rsquo;s arms before a great concourse of people, and hugged
      him, and kissed him, and called him his brother.&nbsp; At the coronation
      which soon followed, Gaveston was the richest and brightest of all the
      glittering company there, and had the honour of carrying the crown.&nbsp;
      This made the proud Lords fiercer than ever; the people, too, despised the
      favourite, and would never call him Earl of Cornwall, however much he
      complained to the King and asked him to punish them for not doing so, but
      persisted in styling him plain Piers Gaveston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barons were so unceremonious with the King in giving him to understand
      that they would not bear this favourite, that the King was obliged to send
      him out of the country.&nbsp; The favourite himself was made to take an
      oath (more oaths!) that he would never come back, and the Barons supposed
      him to be banished in disgrace, until they heard that he was appointed
      Governor of Ireland.&nbsp; Even this was not enough for the besotted King,
      who brought him home again in a year&rsquo;s time, and not only disgusted
      the Court and the people by his doting folly, but offended his beautiful
      wife too, who never liked him afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had now the old Royal want&mdash;of money&mdash;and the Barons had the
      new power of positively refusing to let him raise any.&nbsp; He summoned a
      Parliament at York; the Barons refused to make one, while the favourite
      was near him.&nbsp; He summoned another Parliament at Westminster, and
      sent Gaveston away.&nbsp; Then, the Barons came, completely armed, and
      appointed a committee of themselves to correct abuses in the state and in
      the King&rsquo;s household.&nbsp; He got some money on these conditions,
      and directly set off with Gaveston to the Border-country, where they spent
      it in idling away the time, and feasting, while Bruce made ready to drive
      the English out of Scotland.&nbsp; For, though the old King had even made
      this poor weak son of his swear (as some say) that he would not bury his
      bones, but would have them boiled clean in a caldron, and carried before
      the English army until Scotland was entirely subdued, the second Edward
      was so unlike the first that Bruce gained strength and power every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee of Nobles, after some months of deliberation, ordained that
      the King should henceforth call a Parliament together, once every year,
      and even twice if necessary, instead of summoning it only when he chose.&nbsp;
      Further, that Gaveston should once more be banished, and, this time, on
      pain of death if he ever came back.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s tears were of
      no avail; he was obliged to send his favourite to Flanders.&nbsp; As soon
      as he had done so, however, he dissolved the Parliament, with the low
      cunning of a mere fool, and set off to the North of England, thinking to
      get an army about him to oppose the Nobles.&nbsp; And once again he
      brought Gaveston home, and heaped upon him all the riches and titles of
      which the Barons had deprived him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lords saw, now, that there was nothing for it but to put the favourite
      to death.&nbsp; They could have done so, legally, according to the terms
      of his banishment; but they did so, I am sorry to say, in a shabby manner.&nbsp;
      Led by the Earl of Lancaster, the King&rsquo;s cousin, they first of all
      attacked the King and Gaveston at Newcastle.&nbsp; They had time to escape
      by sea, and the mean King, having his precious Gaveston with him, was
      quite content to leave his lovely wife behind.&nbsp; When they were
      comparatively safe, they separated; the King went to York to collect a
      force of soldiers; and the favourite shut himself up, in the meantime, in
      Scarborough Castle overlooking the sea.&nbsp; This was what the Barons
      wanted.&nbsp; They knew that the Castle could not hold out; they attacked
      it, and made Gaveston surrender.&nbsp; He delivered himself up to the Earl
      of Pembroke&mdash;that Lord whom he had called the Jew&mdash;on the Earl&rsquo;s
      pledging his faith and knightly word, that no harm should happen to him
      and no violence be done him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it was agreed with Gaveston that he should be taken to the Castle of
      Wallingford, and there kept in honourable custody.&nbsp; They travelled as
      far as Dedington, near Banbury, where, in the Castle of that place, they
      stopped for a night to rest.&nbsp; Whether the Earl of Pembroke left his
      prisoner there, knowing what would happen, or really left him thinking no
      harm, and only going (as he pretended) to visit his wife, the Countess,
      who was in the neighbourhood, is no great matter now; in any case, he was
      bound as an honourable gentleman to protect his prisoner, and he did not
      do it.&nbsp; In the morning, while the favourite was yet in bed, he was
      required to dress himself and come down into the court-yard.&nbsp; He did
      so without any mistrust, but started and turned pale when he found it full
      of strange armed men.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think you know me?&rsquo; said their
      leader, also armed from head to foot.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am the black dog of
      Ardenne!&rsquo;&nbsp; The time was come when Piers Gaveston was to feel
      the black dog&rsquo;s teeth indeed.&nbsp; They set him on a mule, and
      carried him, in mock state and with military music, to the black dog&rsquo;s
      kennel&mdash;Warwick Castle&mdash;where a hasty council, composed of some
      great noblemen, considered what should be done with him.&nbsp; Some were
      for sparing him, but one loud voice&mdash;it was the black dog&rsquo;s
      bark, I dare say&mdash;sounded through the Castle Hall, uttering these
      words: &lsquo;You have the fox in your power.&nbsp; Let him go now, and
      you must hunt him again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They sentenced him to death.&nbsp; He threw himself at the feet of the
      Earl of Lancaster&mdash;the old hog&mdash;but the old hog was as savage as
      the dog.&nbsp; He was taken out upon the pleasant road, leading from
      Warwick to Coventry, where the beautiful river Avon, by which, long
      afterwards, <span class="smcap">William Shakespeare</span> was born and
      now lies buried, sparkled in the bright landscape of the beautiful
      May-day; and there they struck off his wretched head, and stained the dust
      with his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King heard of this black deed, in his grief and rage he denounced
      relentless war against his Barons, and both sides were in arms for half a
      year.&nbsp; But, it then became necessary for them to join their forces
      against Bruce, who had used the time well while they were divided, and had
      now a great power in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligence was brought that Bruce was then besieging Stirling Castle,
      and that the Governor had been obliged to pledge himself to surrender it,
      unless he should be relieved before a certain day.&nbsp; Hereupon, the
      King ordered the nobles and their fighting-men to meet him at Berwick;
      but, the nobles cared so little for the King, and so neglected the
      summons, and lost time, that only on the day before that appointed for the
      surrender, did the King find himself at Stirling, and even then with a
      smaller force than he had expected.&nbsp; However, he had, altogether, a
      hundred thousand men, and Bruce had not more than forty thousand; but,
      Bruce&rsquo;s army was strongly posted in three square columns, on the
      ground lying between the Burn or Brook of Bannock and the walls of
      Stirling Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very evening, when the King came up, Bruce did a brave act that
      encouraged his men.&nbsp; He was seen by a certain <span class="smcap">Henry
      de Bohun</span>, an English Knight, riding about before his army on a
      little horse, with a light battle-axe in his hand, and a crown of gold on
      his head.&nbsp; This English Knight, who was mounted on a strong
      war-horse, cased in steel, strongly armed, and able (as he thought) to
      overthrow Bruce by crushing him with his mere weight, set spurs to his
      great charger, rode on him, and made a thrust at him with his heavy spear.&nbsp;
      Bruce parried the thrust, and with one blow of his battle-axe split his
      skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scottish men did not forget this, next day when the battle raged.&nbsp;
      <span class="smcap">Randolph</span>, Bruce&rsquo;s valiant Nephew, rode,
      with the small body of men he commanded, into such a host of the English,
      all shining in polished armour in the sunlight, that they seemed to be
      swallowed up and lost, as if they had plunged into the sea.&nbsp; But,
      they fought so well, and did such dreadful execution, that the English
      staggered.&nbsp; Then came Bruce himself upon them, with all the rest of
      his army.&nbsp; While they were thus hard pressed and amazed, there
      appeared upon the hills what they supposed to be a new Scottish army, but
      what were really only the camp followers, in number fifteen thousand: whom
      Bruce had taught to show themselves at that place and time.&nbsp; The Earl
      of Gloucester, commanding the English horse, made a last rush to change
      the fortune of the day; but Bruce (like Jack the Giant-killer in the
      story) had had pits dug in the ground, and covered over with turfs and
      stakes.&nbsp; Into these, as they gave way beneath the weight of the
      horses, riders and horses rolled by hundreds.&nbsp; The English were
      completely routed; all their treasure, stores, and engines, were taken by
      the Scottish men; so many waggons and other wheeled vehicles were seized,
      that it is related that they would have reached, if they had been drawn
      out in a line, one hundred and eighty miles.&nbsp; The fortunes of
      Scotland were, for the time, completely changed; and never was a battle
      won, more famous upon Scottish ground, than this great battle of <span
      class="smcap">Bannockburn</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plague and famine succeeded in England; and still the powerless King and
      his disdainful Lords were always in contention.&nbsp; Some of the
      turbulent chiefs of Ireland made proposals to Bruce, to accept the rule of
      that country.&nbsp; He sent his brother Edward to them, who was crowned
      King of Ireland.&nbsp; He afterwards went himself to help his brother in
      his Irish wars, but his brother was defeated in the end and killed.&nbsp;
      Robert Bruce, returning to Scotland, still increased his strength there.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the King&rsquo;s ruin had begun in a favourite, so it seemed likely to
      end in one.&nbsp; He was too poor a creature to rely at all upon himself;
      and his new favourite was one <span class="smcap">Hugh le Despenser</span>,
      the son of a gentleman of ancient family.&nbsp; Hugh was handsome and
      brave, but he was the favourite of a weak King, whom no man cared a rush
      for, and that was a dangerous place to hold.&nbsp; The Nobles leagued
      against him, because the King liked him; and they lay in wait, both for
      his ruin and his father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Now, the King had married him to
      the daughter of the late Earl of Gloucester, and had given both him and
      his father great possessions in Wales.&nbsp; In their endeavours to extend
      these, they gave violent offence to an angry Welsh gentleman, named <span
      class="smcap">John de Mowbray</span>, and to divers other angry Welsh
      gentlemen, who resorted to arms, took their castles, and seized their
      estates.&nbsp; The Earl of Lancaster had first placed the favourite (who
      was a poor relation of his own) at Court, and he considered his own
      dignity offended by the preference he received and the honours he
      acquired; so he, and the Barons who were his friends, joined the Welshmen,
      marched on London, and sent a message to the King demanding to have the
      favourite and his father banished.&nbsp; At first, the King unaccountably
      took it into his head to be spirited, and to send them a bold reply; but
      when they quartered themselves around Holborn and Clerkenwell, and went
      down, armed, to the Parliament at Westminster, he gave way, and complied
      with their demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      His turn of triumph came sooner than he expected.&nbsp; It arose out of an
      accidental circumstance.&nbsp; The beautiful Queen happening to be
      travelling, came one night to one of the royal castles, and demanded to be
      lodged and entertained there until morning.&nbsp; The governor of this
      castle, who was one of the enraged lords, was away, and in his absence,
      his wife refused admission to the Queen; a scuffle took place among the
      common men on either side, and some of the royal attendants were killed.&nbsp;
      The people, who cared nothing for the King, were very angry that their
      beautiful Queen should be thus rudely treated in her own dominions; and
      the King, taking advantage of this feeling, besieged the castle, took it,
      and then called the two Despensers home.&nbsp; Upon this, the confederate
      lords and the Welshmen went over to Bruce.&nbsp; The King encountered them
      at Boroughbridge, gained the victory, and took a number of distinguished
      prisoners; among them, the Earl of Lancaster, now an old man, upon whose
      destruction he was resolved.&nbsp; This Earl was taken to his own castle
      of Pontefract, and there tried and found guilty by an unfair court
      appointed for the purpose; he was not even allowed to speak in his own
      defence.&nbsp; He was insulted, pelted, mounted on a starved pony without
      saddle or bridle, carried out, and beheaded.&nbsp; Eight-and-twenty
      knights were hanged, drawn, and quartered.&nbsp; When the King had
      despatched this bloody work, and had made a fresh and a long truce with
      Bruce, he took the Despensers into greater favour than ever, and made the
      father Earl of Winchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      One prisoner, and an important one, who was taken at Boroughbridge, made
      his escape, however, and turned the tide against the King.&nbsp; This was
      <span class="smcap">Roger Mortimer</span>, always resolutely opposed to
      him, who was sentenced to death, and placed for safe custody in the Tower
      of London.&nbsp; He treated his guards to a quantity of wine into which he
      had put a sleeping potion; and, when they were insensible, broke out of
      his dungeon, got into a kitchen, climbed up the chimney, let himself down
      from the roof of the building with a rope-ladder, passed the sentries, got
      down to the river, and made away in a boat to where servants and horses
      were waiting for him.&nbsp; He finally escaped to France, where <span
      class="smcap">Charles le Bel</span>, the brother of the beautiful Queen,
      was King.&nbsp; Charles sought to quarrel with the King of England, on
      pretence of his not having come to do him homage at his coronation.&nbsp;
      It was proposed that the beautiful Queen should go over to arrange the
      dispute; she went, and wrote home to the King, that as he was sick and
      could not come to France himself, perhaps it would be better to send over
      the young Prince, their son, who was only twelve years old, who could do
      homage to her brother in his stead, and in whose company she would
      immediately return.&nbsp; The King sent him: but, both he and the Queen
      remained at the French Court, and Roger Mortimer became the Queen&rsquo;s
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King wrote, again and again, to the Queen to come home, she did
      not reply that she despised him too much to live with him any more (which
      was the truth), but said she was afraid of the two Despensers.&nbsp; In
      short, her design was to overthrow the favourites&rsquo; power, and the
      King&rsquo;s power, such as it was, and invade England.&nbsp; Having
      obtained a French force of two thousand men, and being joined by all the
      English exiles then in France, she landed, within a year, at Orewell, in
      Suffolk, where she was immediately joined by the Earls of Kent and
      Norfolk, the King&rsquo;s two brothers; by other powerful noblemen; and
      lastly, by the first English general who was despatched to check her: who
      went over to her with all his men.&nbsp; The people of London, receiving
      these tidings, would do nothing for the King, but broke open the Tower,
      let out all his prisoners, and threw up their caps and hurrahed for the
      beautiful Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, with his two favourites, fled to Bristol, where he left old
      Despenser in charge of the town and castle, while he went on with the son
      to Wales.&nbsp; The Bristol men being opposed to the King, and it being
      impossible to hold the town with enemies everywhere within the walls,
      Despenser yielded it up on the third day, and was instantly brought to
      trial for having traitorously influenced what was called &lsquo;the King&rsquo;s
      mind&rsquo;&mdash;though I doubt if the King ever had any.&nbsp; He was a
      venerable old man, upwards of ninety years of age, but his age gained no
      respect or mercy.&nbsp; He was hanged, torn open while he was yet alive,
      cut up into pieces, and thrown to the dogs.&nbsp; His son was soon taken,
      tried at Hereford before the same judge on a long series of foolish
      charges, found guilty, and hanged upon a gallows fifty feet high, with a
      chaplet of nettles round his head.&nbsp; His poor old father and he were
      innocent enough of any worse crimes than the crime of having been friends
      of a King, on whom, as a mere man, they would never have deigned to cast a
      favourable look.&nbsp; It is a bad crime, I know, and leads to worse; but,
      many lords and gentlemen&mdash;I even think some ladies, too, if I
      recollect right&mdash;have committed it in England, who have neither been
      given to the dogs, nor hanged up fifty feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched King was running here and there, all this time, and never
      getting anywhere in particular, until he gave himself up, and was taken
      off to Kenilworth Castle.&nbsp; When he was safely lodged there, the Queen
      went to London and met the Parliament.&nbsp; And the Bishop of Hereford,
      who was the most skilful of her friends, said, What was to be done now?&nbsp;
      Here was an imbecile, indolent, miserable King upon the throne; wouldn&rsquo;t
      it be better to take him off, and put his son there instead?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
      know whether the Queen really pitied him at this pass, but she began to
      cry; so, the Bishop said, Well, my Lords and Gentlemen, what do you think,
      upon the whole, of sending down to Kenilworth, and seeing if His Majesty
      (God bless him, and forbid we should depose him!) won&rsquo;t resign?
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lords and Gentlemen thought it a good notion, so a deputation of them
      went down to Kenilworth; and there the King came into the great hall of
      the Castle, commonly dressed in a poor black gown; and when he saw a
      certain bishop among them, fell down, poor feeble-headed man, and made a
      wretched spectacle of himself.&nbsp; Somebody lifted him up, and then
      <span class="smcap">Sir William Trussel</span>, the Speaker of the House
      of Commons, almost frightened him to death by making him a tremendous
      speech to the effect that he was no longer a King, and that everybody
      renounced allegiance to him.&nbsp; After which, <span class="smcap">Sir
      Thomas Blount</span>, the Steward of the Household, nearly finished him,
      by coming forward and breaking his white wand&mdash;which was a ceremony
      only performed at a King&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Being asked in this pressing
      manner what he thought of resigning, the King said he thought it was the
      best thing he could do.&nbsp; So, he did it, and they proclaimed his son
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I could close his history by saying that he lived a harmless life
      in the Castle and the Castle gardens at Kenilworth, many years&mdash;that
      he had a favourite, and plenty to eat and drink&mdash;and, having that,
      wanted nothing.&nbsp; But he was shamefully humiliated.&nbsp; He was
      outraged, and slighted, and had dirty water from ditches given him to
      shave with, and wept and said he would have clean warm water, and was
      altogether very miserable.&nbsp; He was moved from this castle to that
      castle, and from that castle to the other castle, because this lord or
      that lord, or the other lord, was too kind to him: until at last he came
      to Berkeley Castle, near the River Severn, where (the Lord Berkeley being
      then ill and absent) he fell into the hands of two black ruffians, called
      <span class="smcap">Thomas Gournay</span> and <span class="smcap">William
      Ogle</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night&mdash;it was the night of September the twenty-first, one
      thousand three hundred and twenty-seven&mdash;dreadful screams were heard,
      by the startled people in the neighbouring town, ringing through the thick
      walls of the Castle, and the dark, deep night; and they said, as they were
      thus horribly awakened from their sleep, &lsquo;May Heaven be merciful to
      the King; for those cries forbode that no good is being done to him in his
      dismal prison!&rsquo;&nbsp; Next morning he was dead&mdash;not bruised, or
      stabbed, or marked upon the body, but much distorted in the face; and it
      was whispered afterwards, that those two villains, Gournay and Ogle, had
      burnt up his inside with a red-hot iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ever come near Gloucester, and see the centre tower of its
      beautiful Cathedral, with its four rich pinnacles, rising lightly in the
      air; you may remember that the wretched Edward the Second was buried in
      the old abbey of that ancient city, at forty-three years old, after being
      for nineteen years and a half a perfectly incapable King.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE THIRD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Roger Mortimer, the Queen&rsquo;s lover (who escaped to France in the last
      chapter), was far from profiting by the examples he had had of the fate of
      favourites.&nbsp; Having, through the Queen&rsquo;s influence, come into
      possession of the estates of the two Despensers, he became extremely proud
      and ambitious, and sought to be the real ruler of England.&nbsp; The young
      King, who was crowned at fourteen years of age with all the usual
      solemnities, resolved not to bear this, and soon pursued Mortimer to his
      ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people themselves were not fond of Mortimer&mdash;first, because he
      was a Royal favourite; secondly, because he was supposed to have helped to
      make a peace with Scotland which now took place, and in virtue of which
      the young King&rsquo;s sister Joan, only seven years old, was promised in
      marriage to David, the son and heir of Robert Bruce, who was only five
      years old.&nbsp; The nobles hated Mortimer because of his pride, riches,
      and power.&nbsp; They went so far as to take up arms against him; but were
      obliged to submit.&nbsp; The Earl of Kent, one of those who did so, but
      who afterwards went over to Mortimer and the Queen, was made an example of
      in the following cruel manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      He seems to have been anything but a wise old earl; and he was persuaded
      by the agents of the favourite and the Queen, that poor King Edward the
      Second was not really dead; and thus was betrayed into writing letters
      favouring his rightful claim to the throne.&nbsp; This was made out to be
      high treason, and he was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to be
      executed.&nbsp; They took the poor old lord outside the town of
      Winchester, and there kept him waiting some three or four hours until they
      could find somebody to cut off his head.&nbsp; At last, a convict said he
      would do it, if the government would pardon him in return; and they gave
      him the pardon; and at one blow he put the Earl of Kent out of his last
      suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Queen was in France, she had found a lovely and good young lady,
      named Philippa, who she thought would make an excellent wife for her son.&nbsp;
      The young King married this lady, soon after he came to the throne; and
      her first child, Edward, Prince of Wales, afterwards became celebrated, as
      we shall presently see, under the famous title of <span class="smcap">Edward
      the Black Prince</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young King, thinking the time ripe for the downfall of Mortimer, took
      counsel with Lord Montacute how he should proceed.&nbsp; A Parliament was
      going to be held at Nottingham, and that lord recommended that the
      favourite should be seized by night in Nottingham Castle, where he was
      sure to be.&nbsp; Now, this, like many other things, was more easily said
      than done; because, to guard against treachery, the great gates of the
      Castle were locked every night, and the great keys were carried up-stairs
      to the Queen, who laid them under her own pillow.&nbsp; But the Castle had
      a governor, and the governor being Lord Montacute&rsquo;s friend, confided
      to him how he knew of a secret passage underground, hidden from
      observation by the weeds and brambles with which it was overgrown; and
      how, through that passage, the conspirators might enter in the dead of the
      night, and go straight to Mortimer&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Accordingly, upon a
      certain dark night, at midnight, they made their way through this dismal
      place: startling the rats, and frightening the owls and bats: and came
      safely to the bottom of the main tower of the Castle, where the King met
      them, and took them up a profoundly-dark staircase in a deep silence.&nbsp;
      They soon heard the voice of Mortimer in council with some friends; and
      bursting into the room with a sudden noise, took him prisoner.&nbsp; The
      Queen cried out from her bed-chamber, &lsquo;Oh, my sweet son, my dear
      son, spare my gentle Mortimer!&rsquo;&nbsp; They carried him off, however;
      and, before the next Parliament, accused him of having made differences
      between the young King and his mother, and of having brought about the
      death of the Earl of Kent, and even of the late King; for, as you know by
      this time, when they wanted to get rid of a man in those old days, they
      were not very particular of what they accused him.&nbsp; Mortimer was
      found guilty of all this, and was sentenced to be hanged at Tyburn.&nbsp;
      The King shut his mother up in genteel confinement, where she passed the
      rest of her life; and now he became King in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first effort he made was to conquer Scotland.&nbsp; The English lords
      who had lands in Scotland, finding that their rights were not respected
      under the late peace, made war on their own account: choosing for their
      general, Edward, the son of John Baliol, who made such a vigorous fight,
      that in less than two months he won the whole Scottish Kingdom.&nbsp; He
      was joined, when thus triumphant, by the King and Parliament; and he and
      the King in person besieged the Scottish forces in Berwick.&nbsp; The
      whole Scottish army coming to the assistance of their countrymen, such a
      furious battle ensued, that thirty thousand men are said to have been
      killed in it.&nbsp; Baliol was then crowned King of Scotland, doing homage
      to the King of England; but little came of his successes after all, for
      the Scottish men rose against him, within no very long time, and David
      Bruce came back within ten years and took his kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      France was a far richer country than Scotland, and the King had a much
      greater mind to conquer it.&nbsp; So, he let Scotland alone, and pretended
      that he had a claim to the French throne in right of his mother.&nbsp; He
      had, in reality, no claim at all; but that mattered little in those times.&nbsp;
      He brought over to his cause many little princes and sovereigns, and even
      courted the alliance of the people of Flanders&mdash;a busy, working
      community, who had very small respect for kings, and whose head man was a
      brewer.&nbsp; With such forces as he raised by these means, Edward invaded
      France; but he did little by that, except run into debt in carrying on the
      war to the extent of three hundred thousand pounds.&nbsp; The next year he
      did better; gaining a great sea-fight in the harbour of Sluys.&nbsp; This
      success, however, was very shortlived, for the Flemings took fright at the
      siege of Saint Omer and ran away, leaving their weapons and baggage behind
      them.&nbsp; Philip, the French King, coming up with his army, and Edward
      being very anxious to decide the war, proposed to settle the difference by
      single combat with him, or by a fight of one hundred knights on each side.&nbsp;
      The French King said, he thanked him; but being very well as he was, he
      would rather not.&nbsp; So, after some skirmishing and talking, a short
      peace was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon broken by King Edward&rsquo;s favouring the cause of John,
      Earl of Montford; a French nobleman, who asserted a claim of his own
      against the French King, and offered to do homage to England for the Crown
      of France, if he could obtain it through England&rsquo;s help.&nbsp; This
      French lord, himself, was soon defeated by the French King&rsquo;s son,
      and shut up in a tower in Paris; but his wife, a courageous and beautiful
      woman, who is said to have had the courage of a man, and the heart of a
      lion, assembled the people of Brittany, where she then was; and, showing
      them her infant son, made many pathetic entreaties to them not to desert
      her and their young Lord.&nbsp; They took fire at this appeal, and rallied
      round her in the strong castle of Hennebon.&nbsp; Here she was not only
      besieged without by the French under Charles de Blois, but was endangered
      within by a dreary old bishop, who was always representing to the people
      what horrors they must undergo if they were faithful&mdash;first from
      famine, and afterwards from fire and sword.&nbsp; But this noble lady,
      whose heart never failed her, encouraged her soldiers by her own example;
      went from post to post like a great general; even mounted on horseback
      fully armed, and, issuing from the castle by a by-path, fell upon the
      French camp, set fire to the tents, and threw the whole force into
      disorder.&nbsp; This done, she got safely back to Hennebon again, and was
      received with loud shouts of joy by the defenders of the castle, who had
      given her up for lost.&nbsp; As they were now very short of provisions,
      however, and as they could not dine off enthusiasm, and as the old bishop
      was always saying, &lsquo;I told you what it would come to!&rsquo; they
      began to lose heart, and to talk of yielding the castle up.&nbsp; The
      brave Countess retiring to an upper room and looking with great grief out
      to sea, where she expected relief from England, saw, at this very time,
      the English ships in the distance, and was relieved and rescued!&nbsp; Sir
      Walter Manning, the English commander, so admired her courage, that, being
      come into the castle with the English knights, and having made a feast
      there, he assaulted the French by way of dessert, and beat them off
      triumphantly.&nbsp; Then he and the knights came back to the castle with
      great joy; and the Countess who had watched them from a high tower,
      thanked them with all her heart, and kissed them every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This noble lady distinguished herself afterwards in a sea-fight with the
      French off Guernsey, when she was on her way to England to ask for more
      troops.&nbsp; Her great spirit roused another lady, the wife of another
      French lord (whom the French King very barbarously murdered), to
      distinguish herself scarcely less.&nbsp; The time was fast coming,
      however, when Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be the great star of this
      French and English war.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the month of July, in the year one thousand three hundred and
      forty-six, when the King embarked at Southampton for France, with an army
      of about thirty thousand men in all, attended by the Prince of Wales and
      by several of the chief nobles.&nbsp; He landed at La Hogue in Normandy;
      and, burning and destroying as he went, according to custom, advanced up
      the left bank of the River Seine, and fired the small towns even close to
      Paris; but, being watched from the right bank of the river by the French
      King and all his army, it came to this at last, that Edward found himself,
      on Saturday the twenty-sixth of August, one thousand three hundred and
      forty-six, on a rising ground behind the little French village of Crecy,
      face to face with the French King&rsquo;s force.&nbsp; And, although the
      French King had an enormous army&mdash;in number more than eight times his&mdash;he
      there resolved to beat him or be beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Prince, assisted by the Earl of Oxford and the Earl of Warwick,
      led the first division of the English army; two other great Earls led the
      second; and the King, the third.&nbsp; When the morning dawned, the King
      received the sacrament, and heard prayers, and then, mounted on horseback
      with a white wand in his hand, rode from company to company, and rank to
      rank, cheering and encouraging both officers and men.&nbsp; Then the whole
      army breakfasted, each man sitting on the ground where he had stood; and
      then they remained quietly on the ground with their weapons ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up came the French King with all his great force.&nbsp; It was dark and
      angry weather; there was an eclipse of the sun; there was a thunder-storm,
      accompanied with tremendous rain; the frightened birds flew screaming
      above the soldiers&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; A certain captain in the French
      army advised the French King, who was by no means cheerful, not to begin
      the battle until the morrow.&nbsp; The King, taking this advice, gave the
      word to halt.&nbsp; But, those behind not understanding it, or desiring to
      be foremost with the rest, came pressing on.&nbsp; The roads for a great
      distance were covered with this immense army, and with the common people
      from the villages, who were flourishing their rude weapons, and making a
      great noise.&nbsp; Owing to these circumstances, the French army advanced
      in the greatest confusion; every French lord doing what he liked with his
      own men, and putting out the men of every other French lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, their King relied strongly upon a great body of cross-bowmen from
      Genoa; and these he ordered to the front to begin the battle, on finding
      that he could not stop it.&nbsp; They shouted once, they shouted twice,
      they shouted three times, to alarm the English archers; but, the English
      would have heard them shout three thousand times and would have never
      moved.&nbsp; At last the cross-bowmen went forward a little, and began to
      discharge their bolts; upon which, the English let fly such a hail of
      arrows, that the Genoese speedily made off&mdash;for their cross-bows,
      besides being heavy to carry, required to be wound up with a handle, and
      consequently took time to re-load; the English, on the other hand, could
      discharge their arrows almost as fast as the arrows could fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the French King saw the Genoese turning, he cried out to his men to
      kill those scoundrels, who were doing harm instead of service.&nbsp; This
      increased the confusion.&nbsp; Meanwhile the English archers, continuing
      to shoot as fast as ever, shot down great numbers of the French soldiers
      and knights; whom certain sly Cornish-men and Welshmen, from the English
      army, creeping along the ground, despatched with great knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince and his division were at this time so hard-pressed, that the
      Earl of Warwick sent a message to the King, who was overlooking the battle
      from a windmill, beseeching him to send more aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is my son killed?&rsquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sire, please God,&rsquo; returned the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he wounded?&rsquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he thrown to the ground?&rsquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sire, not so; but, he is very hard-pressed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;go back to those who sent you,
      and tell them I shall send no aid; because I set my heart upon my son
      proving himself this day a brave knight, and because I am resolved, please
      God, that the honour of a great victory shall be his!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These bold words, being reported to the Prince and his division, so raised
      their spirits, that they fought better than ever.&nbsp; The King of France
      charged gallantly with his men many times; but it was of no use.&nbsp;
      Night closing in, his horse was killed under him by an English arrow, and
      the knights and nobles who had clustered thick about him early in the day,
      were now completely scattered.&nbsp; At last, some of his few remaining
      followers led him off the field by force since he would not retire of
      himself, and they journeyed away to Amiens.&nbsp; The victorious English,
      lighting their watch-fires, made merry on the field, and the King, riding
      to meet his gallant son, took him in his arms, kissed him, and told him
      that he had acted nobly, and proved himself worthy of the day and of the
      crown.&nbsp; While it was yet night, King Edward was hardly aware of the
      great victory he had gained; but, next day, it was discovered that eleven
      princes, twelve hundred knights, and thirty thousand common men lay dead
      upon the French side.&nbsp; Among these was the King of Bohemia, an old
      blind man; who, having been told that his son was wounded in the battle,
      and that no force could stand against the Black Prince, called to him two
      knights, put himself on horse-back between them, fastened the three
      bridles together, and dashed in among the English, where he was presently
      slain.&nbsp; He bore as his crest three white ostrich feathers, with the
      motto <i>Ich dien</i>, signifying in English &lsquo;I serve.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      This crest and motto were taken by the Prince of Wales in remembrance of
      that famous day, and have been borne by the Prince of Wales ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days after this great battle, the King laid siege to Calais.&nbsp;
      This siege&mdash;ever afterwards memorable&mdash;lasted nearly a year.&nbsp;
      In order to starve the inhabitants out, King Edward built so many wooden
      houses for the lodgings of his troops, that it is said their quarters
      looked like a second Calais suddenly sprung around the first.&nbsp; Early
      in the siege, the governor of the town drove out what he called the
      useless mouths, to the number of seventeen hundred persons, men and women,
      young and old.&nbsp; King Edward allowed them to pass through his lines,
      and even fed them, and dismissed them with money; but, later in the siege,
      he was not so merciful&mdash;five hundred more, who were afterwards driven
      out, dying of starvation and misery.&nbsp; The garrison were so
      hard-pressed at last, that they sent a letter to King Philip, telling him
      that they had eaten all the horses, all the dogs, and all the rats and
      mice that could be found in the place; and, that if he did not relieve
      them, they must either surrender to the English, or eat one another.&nbsp;
      Philip made one effort to give them relief; but they were so hemmed in by
      the English power, that he could not succeed, and was fain to leave the
      place.&nbsp; Upon this they hoisted the English flag, and surrendered to
      King Edward.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell your general,&rsquo; said he to the humble
      messengers who came out of the town, &lsquo;that I require to have sent
      here, six of the most distinguished citizens, bare-legged, and in their
      shirts, with ropes about their necks; and let those six men bring with
      them the keys of the castle and the town.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Governor of Calais related this to the people in the
      Market-place, there was great weeping and distress; in the midst of which,
      one worthy citizen, named Eustace de Saint Pierre, rose up and said, that
      if the six men required were not sacrificed, the whole population would
      be; therefore, he offered himself as the first.&nbsp; Encouraged by this
      bright example, five other worthy citizens rose up one after another, and
      offered themselves to save the rest.&nbsp; The Governor, who was too badly
      wounded to be able to walk, mounted a poor old horse that had not been
      eaten, and conducted these good men to the gate, while all the people
      cried and mourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward received them wrathfully, and ordered the heads of the whole six to
      be struck off.&nbsp; However, the good Queen fell upon her knees, and
      besought the King to give them up to her.&nbsp; The King replied, &lsquo;I
      wish you had been somewhere else; but I cannot refuse you.&rsquo;&nbsp; So
      she had them properly dressed, made a feast for them, and sent them back
      with a handsome present, to the great rejoicing of the whole camp.&nbsp; I
      hope the people of Calais loved the daughter to whom she gave birth soon
      afterwards, for her gentle mother&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now came that terrible disease, the Plague, into Europe, hurrying from the
      heart of China; and killed the wretched people&mdash;especially the poor&mdash;in
      such enormous numbers, that one-half of the inhabitants of England are
      related to have died of it.&nbsp; It killed the cattle, in great numbers,
      too; and so few working men remained alive, that there were not enough
      left to till the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      After eight years of differing and quarrelling, the Prince of Wales again
      invaded France with an army of sixty thousand men.&nbsp; He went through
      the south of the country, burning and plundering wheresoever he went;
      while his father, who had still the Scottish war upon his hands, did the
      like in Scotland, but was harassed and worried in his retreat from that
      country by the Scottish men, who repaid his cruelties with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French King, Philip, was now dead, and was succeeded by his son John.&nbsp;
      The Black Prince, called by that name from the colour of the armour he
      wore to set off his fair complexion, continuing to burn and destroy in
      France, roused John into determined opposition; and so cruel had the Black
      Prince been in his campaign, and so severely had the French peasants
      suffered, that he could not find one who, for love, or money, or the fear
      of death, would tell him what the French King was doing, or where he was.&nbsp;
      Thus it happened that he came upon the French King&rsquo;s forces, all of
      a sudden, near the town of Poitiers, and found that the whole neighbouring
      country was occupied by a vast French army.&nbsp; &lsquo;God help us!&rsquo;
      said the Black Prince, &lsquo;we must make the best of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on a Sunday morning, the eighteenth of September, the Prince whose
      army was now reduced to ten thousand men in all&mdash;prepared to give
      battle to the French King, who had sixty thousand horse alone.&nbsp; While
      he was so engaged, there came riding from the French camp, a Cardinal, who
      had persuaded John to let him offer terms, and try to save the shedding of
      Christian blood.&nbsp; &lsquo;Save my honour,&rsquo; said the Prince to
      this good priest, &lsquo;and save the honour of my army, and I will make
      any reasonable terms.&rsquo;&nbsp; He offered to give up all the towns,
      castles, and prisoners, he had taken, and to swear to make no war in
      France for seven years; but, as John would hear of nothing but his
      surrender, with a hundred of his chief knights, the treaty was broken off,
      and the Prince said quietly&mdash;&lsquo;God defend the right; we shall
      fight to-morrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, on the Monday morning, at break of day, the two armies prepared
      for battle.&nbsp; The English were posted in a strong place, which could
      only be approached by one narrow lane, skirted by hedges on both sides.&nbsp;
      The French attacked them by this lane; but were so galled and slain by
      English arrows from behind the hedges, that they were forced to retreat.&nbsp;
      Then went six hundred English bowmen round about, and, coming upon the
      rear of the French army, rained arrows on them thick and fast.&nbsp; The
      French knights, thrown into confusion, quitted their banners and dispersed
      in all directions.&nbsp; Said Sir John Chandos to the Prince, &lsquo;Ride
      forward, noble Prince, and the day is yours.&nbsp; The King of France is
      so valiant a gentleman, that I know he will never fly, and may be taken
      prisoner.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Prince to this, &lsquo;Advance, English
      banners, in the name of God and St. George!&rsquo; and on they pressed
      until they came up with the French King, fighting fiercely with his
      battle-axe, and, when all his nobles had forsaken him, attended faithfully
      to the last by his youngest son Philip, only sixteen years of age.&nbsp;
      Father and son fought well, and the King had already two wounds in his
      face, and had been beaten down, when he at last delivered himself to a
      banished French knight, and gave him his right-hand glove in token that he
      had done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Prince was generous as well as brave, and he invited his royal
      prisoner to supper in his tent, and waited upon him at table, and, when
      they afterwards rode into London in a gorgeous procession, mounted the
      French King on a fine cream-coloured horse, and rode at his side on a
      little pony.&nbsp; This was all very kind, but I think it was, perhaps, a
      little theatrical too, and has been made more meritorious than it deserved
      to be; especially as I am inclined to think that the greatest kindness to
      the King of France would have been not to have shown him to the people at
      all.&nbsp; However, it must be said, for these acts of politeness, that,
      in course of time, they did much to soften the horrors of war and the
      passions of conquerors.&nbsp; It was a long, long time before the common
      soldiers began to have the benefit of such courtly deeds; but they did at
      last; and thus it is possible that a poor soldier who asked for quarter at
      the battle of Waterloo, or any other such great fight, may have owed his
      life indirectly to Edward the Black Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time there stood in the Strand, in London, a palace called the
      Savoy, which was given up to the captive King of France and his son for
      their residence.&nbsp; As the King of Scotland had now been King Edward&rsquo;s
      captive for eleven years too, his success was, at this time, tolerably
      complete.&nbsp; The Scottish business was settled by the prisoner being
      released under the title of Sir David, King of Scotland, and by his
      engaging to pay a large ransom.&nbsp; The state of France encouraged
      England to propose harder terms to that country, where the people rose
      against the unspeakable cruelty and barbarity of its nobles; where the
      nobles rose in turn against the people; where the most frightful outrages
      were committed on all sides; and where the insurrection of the peasants,
      called the insurrection of the Jacquerie, from Jacques, a common Christian
      name among the country people of France, awakened terrors and hatreds that
      have scarcely yet passed away.&nbsp; A treaty called the Great Peace, was
      at last signed, under which King Edward agreed to give up the greater part
      of his conquests, and King John to pay, within six years, a ransom of
      three million crowns of gold.&nbsp; He was so beset by his own nobles and
      courtiers for having yielded to these conditions&mdash;though they could
      help him to no better&mdash;that he came back of his own will to his old
      palace-prison of the Savoy, and there died.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a Sovereign of Castile at that time, called <span class="smcap">Pedro
      the Cruel</span>, who deserved the name remarkably well: having committed,
      among other cruelties, a variety of murders.&nbsp; This amiable monarch
      being driven from his throne for his crimes, went to the province of
      Bordeaux, where the Black Prince&mdash;now married to his cousin <span
      class="smcap">Joan</span>, a pretty widow&mdash;was residing, and besought
      his help.&nbsp; The Prince, who took to him much more kindly than a prince
      of such fame ought to have taken to such a ruffian, readily listened to
      his fair promises, and agreeing to help him, sent secret orders to some
      troublesome disbanded soldiers of his and his father&rsquo;s, who called
      themselves the Free Companions, and who had been a pest to the French
      people, for some time, to aid this Pedro.&nbsp; The Prince, himself, going
      into Spain to head the army of relief, soon set Pedro on his throne again&mdash;where
      he no sooner found himself, than, of course, he behaved like the villain
      he was, broke his word without the least shame, and abandoned all the
      promises he had made to the Black Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it had cost the Prince a good deal of money to pay soldiers to
      support this murderous King; and finding himself, when he came back
      disgusted to Bordeaux, not only in bad health, but deeply in debt, he
      began to tax his French subjects to pay his creditors.&nbsp; They appealed
      to the French King, <span class="smcap">Charles</span>; war again broke
      out; and the French town of Limoges, which the Prince had greatly
      benefited, went over to the French King.&nbsp; Upon this he ravaged the
      province of which it was the capital; burnt, and plundered, and killed in
      the old sickening way; and refused mercy to the prisoners, men, women, and
      children taken in the offending town, though he was so ill and so much in
      need of pity himself from Heaven, that he was carried in a litter.&nbsp;
      He lived to come home and make himself popular with the people and
      Parliament, and he died on Trinity Sunday, the eighth of June, one
      thousand three hundred and seventy-six, at forty-six years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole nation mourned for him as one of the most renowned and beloved
      princes it had ever had; and he was buried with great lamentations in
      Canterbury Cathedral.&nbsp; Near to the tomb of Edward the Confessor, his
      monument, with his figure, carved in stone, and represented in the old
      black armour, lying on its back, may be seen at this day, with an ancient
      coat of mail, a helmet, and a pair of gauntlets hanging from a beam above
      it, which most people like to believe were once worn by the Black Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward did not outlive his renowned son, long.&nbsp; He was old, and
      one Alice Perrers, a beautiful lady, had contrived to make him so fond of
      her in his old age, that he could refuse her nothing, and made himself
      ridiculous.&nbsp; She little deserved his love, or&mdash;what I dare say
      she valued a great deal more&mdash;the jewels of the late Queen, which he
      gave her among other rich presents.&nbsp; She took the very ring from his
      finger on the morning of the day when he died, and left him to be pillaged
      by his faithless servants.&nbsp; Only one good priest was true to him, and
      attended him to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides being famous for the great victories I have related, the reign of
      King Edward the Third was rendered memorable in better ways, by the growth
      of architecture and the erection of Windsor Castle.&nbsp; In better ways
      still, by the rising up of <span class="smcap">Wickliffe</span>,
      originally a poor parish priest: who devoted himself to exposing, with
      wonderful power and success, the ambition and corruption of the Pope, and
      of the whole church of which he was the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of those Flemings were induced to come to England in this reign too,
      and to settle in Norfolk, where they made better woollen cloths than the
      English had ever had before.&nbsp; The Order of the Garter (a very fine
      thing in its way, but hardly so important as good clothes for the nation)
      also dates from this period.&nbsp; The King is said to have picked &lsquo;up
      a lady&rsquo;s garter at a ball, and to have said, <i>Honi soit qui mal y
      pense</i>&mdash;in English, &lsquo;Evil be to him who evil thinks of it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      The courtiers were usually glad to imitate what the King said or did, and
      hence from a slight incident the Order of the Garter was instituted, and
      became a great dignity.&nbsp; So the story goes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE SECOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Richard, son of the Black Prince, a boy eleven years of age, succeeded to
      the Crown under the title of King Richard the Second.&nbsp; The whole
      English nation were ready to admire him for the sake of his brave father.&nbsp;
      As to the lords and ladies about the Court, they declared him to be the
      most beautiful, the wisest, and the best&mdash;even of princes&mdash;whom
      the lords and ladies about the Court, generally declare to be the most
      beautiful, the wisest, and the best of mankind.&nbsp; To flatter a poor
      boy in this base manner was not a very likely way to develop whatever good
      was in him; and it brought him to anything but a good or happy end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Lancaster, the young King&rsquo;s uncle&mdash;commonly called
      John of Gaunt, from having been born at Ghent, which the common people so
      pronounced&mdash;was supposed to have some thoughts of the throne himself;
      but, as he was not popular, and the memory of the Black Prince was, he
      submitted to his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war with France being still unsettled, the Government of England
      wanted money to provide for the expenses that might arise out of it;
      accordingly a certain tax, called the Poll-tax, which had originated in
      the last reign, was ordered to be levied on the people.&nbsp; This was a
      tax on every person in the kingdom, male and female, above the age of
      fourteen, of three groats (or three four-penny pieces) a year; clergymen
      were charged more, and only beggars were exempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no need to repeat that the common people of England had long been
      suffering under great oppression.&nbsp; They were still the mere slaves of
      the lords of the land on which they lived, and were on most occasions
      harshly and unjustly treated.&nbsp; But, they had begun by this time to
      think very seriously of not bearing quite so much; and, probably, were
      emboldened by that French insurrection I mentioned in the last chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of Essex rose against the Poll-tax, and being severely handled
      by the government officers, killed some of them.&nbsp; At this very time
      one of the tax-collectors, going his rounds from house to house, at
      Dartford in Kent came to the cottage of one <span class="smcap">Wat</span>,
      a tiler by trade, and claimed the tax upon his daughter.&nbsp; Her mother,
      who was at home, declared that she was under the age of fourteen; upon
      that, the collector (as other collectors had already done in different
      parts of England) behaved in a savage way, and brutally insulted Wat Tyler&rsquo;s
      daughter.&nbsp; The daughter screamed, the mother screamed.&nbsp; Wat the
      Tiler, who was at work not far off, ran to the spot, and did what any
      honest father under such provocation might have done&mdash;struck the
      collector dead at a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the people of that town uprose as one man.&nbsp; They made Wat
      Tyler their leader; they joined with the people of Essex, who were in arms
      under a priest called <span class="smcap">Jack Straw</span>; they took out
      of prison another priest named <span class="smcap">John Ball</span>; and
      gathering in numbers as they went along, advanced, in a great confused
      army of poor men, to Blackheath.&nbsp; It is said that they wanted to
      abolish all property, and to declare all men equal.&nbsp; I do not think
      this very likely; because they stopped the travellers on the roads and
      made them swear to be true to King Richard and the people.&nbsp; Nor were
      they at all disposed to injure those who had done them no harm, merely
      because they were of high station; for, the King&rsquo;s mother, who had
      to pass through their camp at Blackheath, on her way to her young son,
      lying for safety in the Tower of London, had merely to kiss a few
      dirty-faced rough-bearded men who were noisily fond of royalty, and so got
      away in perfect safety.&nbsp; Next day the whole mass marched on to London
      Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a drawbridge in the middle, which <span class="smcap">William
      Walworth</span> the Mayor caused to be raised to prevent their coming into
      the city; but they soon terrified the citizens into lowering it again, and
      spread themselves, with great uproar, over the streets.&nbsp; They broke
      open the prisons; they burned the papers in Lambeth Palace; they destroyed
      the <span class="smcap">Duke of Lancaster&rsquo;s</span> Palace, the
      Savoy, in the Strand, said to be the most beautiful and splendid in
      England; they set fire to the books and documents in the Temple; and made
      a great riot.&nbsp; Many of these outrages were committed in drunkenness;
      since those citizens, who had well-filled cellars, were only too glad to
      throw them open to save the rest of their property; but even the drunken
      rioters were very careful to steal nothing.&nbsp; They were so angry with
      one man, who was seen to take a silver cup at the Savoy Palace, and put it
      in his breast, that they drowned him in the river, cup and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young King had been taken out to treat with them before they committed
      these excesses; but, he and the people about him were so frightened by the
      riotous shouts, that they got back to the Tower in the best way they
      could.&nbsp; This made the insurgents bolder; so they went on rioting
      away, striking off the heads of those who did not, at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice, declare for King Richard and the people; and killing as many of
      the unpopular persons whom they supposed to be their enemies as they could
      by any means lay hold of.&nbsp; In this manner they passed one very
      violent day, and then proclamation was made that the King would meet them
      at Mile-end, and grant their requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rioters went to Mile-end to the number of sixty thousand, and the King
      met them there, and to the King the rioters peaceably proposed four
      conditions.&nbsp; First, that neither they, nor their children, nor any
      coming after them, should be made slaves any more.&nbsp; Secondly, that
      the rent of land should be fixed at a certain price in money, instead of
      being paid in service.&nbsp; Thirdly, that they should have liberty to buy
      and sell in all markets and public places, like other free men.&nbsp;
      Fourthly, that they should be pardoned for past offences.&nbsp; Heaven
      knows, there was nothing very unreasonable in these proposals!&nbsp; The
      young King deceitfully pretended to think so, and kept thirty clerks up,
      all night, writing out a charter accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Wat Tyler himself wanted more than this.&nbsp; He wanted the entire
      abolition of the forest laws.&nbsp; He was not at Mile-end with the rest,
      but, while that meeting was being held, broke into the Tower of London and
      slew the archbishop and the treasurer, for whose heads the people had
      cried out loudly the day before.&nbsp; He and his men even thrust their
      swords into the bed of the Princess of Wales while the Princess was in it,
      to make certain that none of their enemies were concealed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Wat and his men still continued armed, and rode about the city.&nbsp;
      Next morning, the King with a small train of some sixty gentlemen&mdash;among
      whom was <span class="smcap">Walworth</span> the Mayor&mdash;rode into
      Smithfield, and saw Wat and his people at a little distance.&nbsp; Says
      Wat to his men, &lsquo;There is the King.&nbsp; I will go speak with him,
      and tell him what we want.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Straightway Wat rode up to him, and began to talk.&nbsp; &lsquo;King,&rsquo;
      says Wat, &lsquo;dost thou see all my men there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; says Wat, &lsquo;they are all at my command, and
      have sworn to do whatever I bid them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some declared afterwards that as Wat said this, he laid his hand on the
      King&rsquo;s bridle.&nbsp; Others declared that he was seen to play with
      his own dagger.&nbsp; I think, myself, that he just spoke to the King like
      a rough, angry man as he was, and did nothing more.&nbsp; At any rate he
      was expecting no attack, and preparing for no resistance, when Walworth
      the Mayor did the not very valiant deed of drawing a short sword and
      stabbing him in the throat.&nbsp; He dropped from his horse, and one of
      the King&rsquo;s people speedily finished him.&nbsp; So fell Wat Tyler.&nbsp;
      Fawners and flatterers made a mighty triumph of it, and set up a cry which
      will occasionally find an echo to this day.&nbsp; But Wat was a
      hard-working man, who had suffered much, and had been foully outraged; and
      it is probable that he was a man of a much higher nature and a much braver
      spirit than any of the parasites who exulted then, or have exulted since,
      over his defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Wat down, his men immediately bent their bows to avenge his fall.&nbsp;
      If the young King had not had presence of mind at that dangerous moment,
      both he and the Mayor to boot, might have followed Tyler pretty fast.&nbsp;
      But the King riding up to the crowd, cried out that Tyler was a traitor,
      and that he would be their leader.&nbsp; They were so taken by surprise,
      that they set up a great shouting, and followed the boy until he was met
      at Islington by a large body of soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of this rising was the then usual end.&nbsp; As soon as the King
      found himself safe, he unsaid all he had said, and undid all he had done;
      some fifteen hundred of the rioters were tried (mostly in Essex) with
      great rigour, and executed with great cruelty.&nbsp; Many of them were
      hanged on gibbets, and left there as a terror to the country people; and,
      because their miserable friends took some of the bodies down to bury, the
      King ordered the rest to be chained up&mdash;which was the beginning of
      the barbarous custom of hanging in chains.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s
      falsehood in this business makes such a pitiful figure, that I think Wat
      Tyler appears in history as beyond comparison the truer and more
      respectable man of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was now sixteen years of age, and married Anne of Bohemia, an
      excellent princess, who was called &lsquo;the good Queen Anne.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      She deserved a better husband; for the King had been fawned and flattered
      into a treacherous, wasteful, dissolute, bad young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two Popes at this time (as if one were not enough!), and their
      quarrels involved Europe in a great deal of trouble.&nbsp; Scotland was
      still troublesome too; and at home there was much jealousy and distrust,
      and plotting and counter-plotting, because the King feared the ambition of
      his relations, and particularly of his uncle, the Duke of Lancaster, and
      the duke had his party against the King, and the King had his party
      against the duke.&nbsp; Nor were these home troubles lessened when the
      duke went to Castile to urge his claim to the crown of that kingdom; for
      then the Duke of Gloucester, another of Richard&rsquo;s uncles, opposed
      him, and influenced the Parliament to demand the dismissal of the King&rsquo;s
      favourite ministers.&nbsp; The King said in reply, that he would not for
      such men dismiss the meanest servant in his kitchen.&nbsp; But, it had
      begun to signify little what a King said when a Parliament was determined;
      so Richard was at last obliged to give way, and to agree to another
      Government of the kingdom, under a commission of fourteen nobles, for a
      year.&nbsp; His uncle of Gloucester was at the head of this commission,
      and, in fact, appointed everybody composing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done all this, the King declared as soon as he saw an opportunity
      that he had never meant to do it, and that it was all illegal; and he got
      the judges secretly to sign a declaration to that effect.&nbsp; The secret
      oozed out directly, and was carried to the Duke of Gloucester.&nbsp; The
      Duke of Gloucester, at the head of forty thousand men, met the King on his
      entering into London to enforce his authority; the King was helpless
      against him; his favourites and ministers were impeached and were
      mercilessly executed.&nbsp; Among them were two men whom the people
      regarded with very different feelings; one, Robert Tresilian, Chief
      Justice, who was hated for having made what was called &lsquo;the bloody
      circuit&rsquo; to try the rioters; the other, Sir Simon Burley, an
      honourable knight, who had been the dear friend of the Black Prince, and
      the governor and guardian of the King.&nbsp; For this gentleman&rsquo;s
      life the good Queen even begged of Gloucester on her knees; but Gloucester
      (with or without reason) feared and hated him, and replied, that if she
      valued her husband&rsquo;s crown, she had better beg no more.&nbsp; All
      this was done under what was called by some the wonderful&mdash;and by
      others, with better reason, the merciless&mdash;Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gloucester&rsquo;s power was not to last for ever.&nbsp; He held it
      for only a year longer; in which year the famous battle of Otterbourne,
      sung in the old ballad of Chevy Chase, was fought.&nbsp; When the year was
      out, the King, turning suddenly to Gloucester, in the midst of a great
      council said, &lsquo;Uncle, how old am I?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
      highness,&rsquo; returned the Duke, &lsquo;is in your twenty-second year.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      &lsquo;Am I so much?&rsquo; said the King; &lsquo;then I will manage my
      own affairs!&nbsp; I am much obliged to you, my good lords, for your past
      services, but I need them no more.&rsquo;&nbsp; He followed this up, by
      appointing a new Chancellor and a new Treasurer, and announced to the
      people that he had resumed the Government.&nbsp; He held it for eight
      years without opposition.&nbsp; Through all that time, he kept his
      determination to revenge himself some day upon his uncle Gloucester, in
      his own breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the good Queen died, and then the King, desiring to take a second
      wife, proposed to his council that he should marry Isabella, of France,
      the daughter of Charles the Sixth: who, the French courtiers said (as the
      English courtiers had said of Richard), was a marvel of beauty and wit,
      and quite a phenomenon&mdash;of seven years old.&nbsp; The council were
      divided about this marriage, but it took place.&nbsp; It secured peace
      between England and France for a quarter of a century; but it was strongly
      opposed to the prejudices of the English people.&nbsp; The Duke of
      Gloucester, who was anxious to take the occasion of making himself
      popular, declaimed against it loudly, and this at length decided the King
      to execute the vengeance he had been nursing so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went with a gay company to the Duke of Gloucester&rsquo;s house,
      Pleshey Castle, in Essex, where the Duke, suspecting nothing, came out
      into the court-yard to receive his royal visitor.&nbsp; While the King
      conversed in a friendly manner with the Duchess, the Duke was quietly
      seized, hurried away, shipped for Calais, and lodged in the castle there.&nbsp;
      His friends, the Earls of Arundel and Warwick, were taken in the same
      treacherous manner, and confined to their castles.&nbsp; A few days after,
      at Nottingham, they were impeached of high treason.&nbsp; The Earl of
      Arundel was condemned and beheaded, and the Earl of Warwick was banished.&nbsp;
      Then, a writ was sent by a messenger to the Governor of Calais, requiring
      him to send the Duke of Gloucester over to be tried.&nbsp; In three days
      he returned an answer that he could not do that, because the Duke of
      Gloucester had died in prison.&nbsp; The Duke was declared a traitor, his
      property was confiscated to the King, a real or pretended confession he
      had made in prison to one of the Justices of the Common Pleas was produced
      against him, and there was an end of the matter.&nbsp; How the unfortunate
      duke died, very few cared to know.&nbsp; Whether he really died naturally;
      whether he killed himself; whether, by the King&rsquo;s order, he was
      strangled, or smothered between two beds (as a serving-man of the Governor&rsquo;s
      named Hall, did afterwards declare), cannot be discovered.&nbsp; There is
      not much doubt that he was killed, somehow or other, by his nephew&rsquo;s
      orders.&nbsp; Among the most active nobles in these proceedings were the
      King&rsquo;s cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, whom the King had made Duke of
      Hereford to smooth down the old family quarrels, and some others: who had
      in the family-plotting times done just such acts themselves as they now
      condemned in the duke.&nbsp; They seem to have been a corrupt set of men;
      but such men were easily found about the court in such days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people murmured at all this, and were still very sore about the French
      marriage.&nbsp; The nobles saw how little the King cared for law, and how
      crafty he was, and began to be somewhat afraid for themselves.&nbsp; The
      King&rsquo;s life was a life of continued feasting and excess; his
      retinue, down to the meanest servants, were dressed in the most costly
      manner, and caroused at his tables, it is related, to the number of ten
      thousand persons every day.&nbsp; He himself, surrounded by a body of ten
      thousand archers, and enriched by a duty on wool which the Commons had
      granted him for life, saw no danger of ever being otherwise than powerful
      and absolute, and was as fierce and haughty as a King could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had two of his old enemies left, in the persons of the Dukes of
      Hereford and Norfolk.&nbsp; Sparing these no more than the others, he
      tampered with the Duke of Hereford until he got him to declare before the
      Council that the Duke of Norfolk had lately held some treasonable talk
      with him, as he was riding near Brentford; and that he had told him, among
      other things, that he could not believe the King&rsquo;s oath&mdash;which
      nobody could, I should think.&nbsp; For this treachery he obtained a
      pardon, and the Duke of Norfolk was summoned to appear and defend himself.&nbsp;
      As he denied the charge and said his accuser was a liar and a traitor,
      both noblemen, according to the manner of those times, were held in
      custody, and the truth was ordered to be decided by wager of battle at
      Coventry.&nbsp; This wager of battle meant that whosoever won the combat
      was to be considered in the right; which nonsense meant in effect, that no
      strong man could ever be wrong.&nbsp; A great holiday was made; a great
      crowd assembled, with much parade and show; and the two combatants were
      about to rush at each other with their lances, when the King, sitting in a
      pavilion to see fair, threw down the truncheon he carried in his hand, and
      forbade the battle.&nbsp; The Duke of Hereford was to be banished for ten
      years, and the Duke of Norfolk was to be banished for life.&nbsp; So said
      the King.&nbsp; The Duke of Hereford went to France, and went no farther.&nbsp;
      The Duke of Norfolk made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and afterwards
      died at Venice of a broken heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faster and fiercer, after this, the King went on in his career.&nbsp; The
      Duke of Lancaster, who was the father of the Duke of Hereford, died soon
      after the departure of his son; and, the King, although he had solemnly
      granted to that son leave to inherit his father&rsquo;s property, if it
      should come to him during his banishment, immediately seized it all, like
      a robber.&nbsp; The judges were so afraid of him, that they disgraced
      themselves by declaring this theft to be just and lawful.&nbsp; His
      avarice knew no bounds.&nbsp; He outlawed seventeen counties at once, on a
      frivolous pretence, merely to raise money by way of fines for misconduct.&nbsp;
      In short, he did as many dishonest things as he could; and cared so little
      for the discontent of his subjects&mdash;though even the spaniel
      favourites began to whisper to him that there was such a thing as
      discontent afloat&mdash;that he took that time, of all others, for leaving
      England and making an expedition against the Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was scarcely gone, leaving the <span class="smcap">Duke of York</span>
      Regent in his absence, when his cousin, Henry of Hereford, came over from
      France to claim the rights of which he had been so monstrously deprived.&nbsp;
      He was immediately joined by the two great Earls of Northumberland and
      Westmoreland; and his uncle, the Regent, finding the King&rsquo;s cause
      unpopular, and the disinclination of the army to act against Henry, very
      strong, withdrew with the Royal forces towards Bristol.&nbsp; Henry, at
      the head of an army, came from Yorkshire (where he had landed) to London
      and followed him.&nbsp; They joined their forces&mdash;how they brought
      that about, is not distinctly understood&mdash;and proceeded to Bristol
      Castle, whither three noblemen had taken the young Queen.&nbsp; The castle
      surrendering, they presently put those three noblemen to death.&nbsp; The
      Regent then remained there, and Henry went on to Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, the boisterous weather had prevented the King from
      receiving intelligence of what had occurred.&nbsp; At length it was
      conveyed to him in Ireland, and he sent over the <span class="smcap">Earl
      of Salisbury</span>, who, landing at Conway, rallied the Welshmen, and
      waited for the King a whole fortnight; at the end of that time the
      Welshmen, who were perhaps not very warm for him in the beginning, quite
      cooled down and went home.&nbsp; When the King did land on the coast at
      last, he came with a pretty good power, but his men cared nothing for him,
      and quickly deserted.&nbsp; Supposing the Welshmen to be still at Conway,
      he disguised himself as a priest, and made for that place in company with
      his two brothers and some few of their adherents.&nbsp; But, there were no
      Welshmen left&mdash;only Salisbury and a hundred soldiers.&nbsp; In this
      distress, the King&rsquo;s two brothers, Exeter and Surrey, offered to go
      to Henry to learn what his intentions were.&nbsp; Surrey, who was true to
      Richard, was put into prison.&nbsp; Exeter, who was false, took the royal
      badge, which was a hart, off his shield, and assumed the rose, the badge
      of Henry.&nbsp; After this, it was pretty plain to the King what Henry&rsquo;s
      intentions were, without sending any more messengers to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fallen King, thus deserted&mdash;hemmed in on all sides, and pressed
      with hunger&mdash;rode here and rode there, and went to this castle, and
      went to that castle, endeavouring to obtain some provisions, but could
      find none.&nbsp; He rode wretchedly back to Conway, and there surrendered
      himself to the Earl of Northumberland, who came from Henry, in reality to
      take him prisoner, but in appearance to offer terms; and whose men were
      hidden not far off.&nbsp; By this earl he was conducted to the castle of
      Flint, where his cousin Henry met him, and dropped on his knee as if he
      were still respectful to his sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fair cousin of Lancaster,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;you are very
      welcome&rsquo; (very welcome, no doubt; but he would have been more so, in
      chains or without a head).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; replied Henry, &lsquo;I am come a little before my
      time; but, with your good pleasure, I will show you the reason.&nbsp; Your
      people complain with some bitterness, that you have ruled them rigorously
      for two-and-twenty years.&nbsp; Now, if it please God, I will help you to
      govern them better in future.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fair cousin,&rsquo; replied the abject King, &lsquo;since it
      pleaseth you, it pleaseth me mightily.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, the trumpets sounded, and the King was stuck on a wretched
      horse, and carried prisoner to Chester, where he was made to issue a
      proclamation, calling a Parliament.&nbsp; From Chester he was taken on
      towards London.&nbsp; At Lichfield he tried to escape by getting out of a
      window and letting himself down into a garden; it was all in vain,
      however, and he was carried on and shut up in the Tower, where no one
      pitied him, and where the whole people, whose patience he had quite tired
      out, reproached him without mercy.&nbsp; Before he got there, it is
      related, that his very dog left him and departed from his side to lick the
      hand of Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before the Parliament met, a deputation went to this wrecked King,
      and told him that he had promised the Earl of Northumberland at Conway
      Castle to resign the crown.&nbsp; He said he was quite ready to do it, and
      signed a paper in which he renounced his authority and absolved his people
      from their allegiance to him.&nbsp; He had so little spirit left that he
      gave his royal ring to his triumphant cousin Henry with his own hand, and
      said, that if he could have had leave to appoint a successor, that same
      Henry was the man of all others whom he would have named.&nbsp; Next day,
      the Parliament assembled in Westminster Hall, where Henry sat at the side
      of the throne, which was empty and covered with a cloth of gold.&nbsp; The
      paper just signed by the King was read to the multitude amid shouts of
      joy, which were echoed through all the streets; when some of the noise had
      died away, the King was formally deposed.&nbsp; Then Henry arose, and,
      making the sign of the cross on his forehead and breast, challenged the
      realm of England as his right; the archbishops of Canterbury and York
      seated him on the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The multitude shouted again, and the shouts re-echoed throughout all the
      streets.&nbsp; No one remembered, now, that Richard the Second had ever
      been the most beautiful, the wisest, and the best of princes; and he now
      made living (to my thinking) a far more sorry spectacle in the Tower of
      London, than Wat Tyler had made, lying dead, among the hoofs of the royal
      horses in Smithfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Poll-tax died with Wat.&nbsp; The Smiths to the King and Royal Family,
      could make no chains in which the King could hang the people&rsquo;s
      recollection of him; so the Poll-tax was never collected.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FOURTH, CALLED BOLINGBROKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the last reign, the preaching of Wickliffe against the pride and
      cunning of the Pope and all his men, had made a great noise in England.&nbsp;
      Whether the new King wished to be in favour with the priests, or whether
      he hoped, by pretending to be very religious, to cheat Heaven itself into
      the belief that he was not a usurper, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Both
      suppositions are likely enough.&nbsp; It is certain that he began his
      reign by making a strong show against the followers of Wickliffe, who were
      called Lollards, or heretics&mdash;although his father, John of Gaunt, had
      been of that way of thinking, as he himself had been more than suspected
      of being.&nbsp; It is no less certain that he first established in England
      the detestable and atrocious custom, brought from abroad, of burning those
      people as a punishment for their opinions.&nbsp; It was the importation
      into England of one of the practices of what was called the Holy
      Inquisition: which was the most <i>un</i>holy and the most infamous
      tribunal that ever disgraced mankind, and made men more like demons than
      followers of Our Saviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      No real right to the crown, as you know, was in this King.&nbsp; Edward
      Mortimer, the young Earl of March&mdash;who was only eight or nine years
      old, and who was descended from the Duke of Clarence, the elder brother of
      Henry&rsquo;s father&mdash;was, by succession, the real heir to the
      throne.&nbsp; However, the King got his son declared Prince of Wales; and,
      obtaining possession of the young Earl of March and his little brother,
      kept them in confinement (but not severely) in Windsor Castle.&nbsp; He
      then required the Parliament to decide what was to be done with the
      deposed King, who was quiet enough, and who only said that he hoped his
      cousin Henry would be &lsquo;a good lord&rsquo; to him.&nbsp; The
      Parliament replied that they would recommend his being kept in some secret
      place where the people could not resort, and where his friends could not
      be admitted to see him.&nbsp; Henry accordingly passed this sentence upon
      him, and it now began to be pretty clear to the nation that Richard the
      Second would not live very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a noisy Parliament, as it was an unprincipled one, and the Lords
      quarrelled so violently among themselves as to which of them had been
      loyal and which disloyal, and which consistent and which inconsistent,
      that forty gauntlets are said to have been thrown upon the floor at one
      time as challenges to as many battles: the truth being that they were all
      false and base together, and had been, at one time with the old King, and
      at another time with the new one, and seldom true for any length of time
      to any one.&nbsp; They soon began to plot again.&nbsp; A conspiracy was
      formed to invite the King to a tournament at Oxford, and then to take him
      by surprise and kill him.&nbsp; This murderous enterprise, which was
      agreed upon at secret meetings in the house of the Abbot of Westminster,
      was betrayed by the Earl of Rutland&mdash;one of the conspirators.&nbsp;
      The King, instead of going to the tournament or staying at Windsor (where
      the conspirators suddenly went, on finding themselves discovered, with the
      hope of seizing him), retired to London, proclaimed them all traitors, and
      advanced upon them with a great force.&nbsp; They retired into the west of
      England, proclaiming Richard King; but, the people rose against them, and
      they were all slain.&nbsp; Their treason hastened the death of the deposed
      monarch.&nbsp; Whether he was killed by hired assassins, or whether he was
      starved to death, or whether he refused food on hearing of his brothers
      being killed (who were in that plot), is very doubtful.&nbsp; He met his
      death somehow; and his body was publicly shown at St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Cathedral with only the lower part of the face uncovered.&nbsp; I can
      scarcely doubt that he was killed by the King&rsquo;s orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French wife of the miserable Richard was now only ten years old; and,
      when her father, Charles of France, heard of her misfortunes and of her
      lonely condition in England, he went mad: as he had several times done
      before, during the last five or six years.&nbsp; The French Dukes of
      Burgundy and Bourbon took up the poor girl&rsquo;s cause, without caring
      much about it, but on the chance of getting something out of England.&nbsp;
      The people of Bordeaux, who had a sort of superstitious attachment to the
      memory of Richard, because he was born there, swore by the Lord that he
      had been the best man in all his kingdom&mdash;which was going rather far&mdash;and
      promised to do great things against the English.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when
      they came to consider that they, and the whole people of France, were
      ruined by their own nobles, and that the English rule was much the better
      of the two, they cooled down again; and the two dukes, although they were
      very great men, could do nothing without them.&nbsp; Then, began
      negotiations between France and England for the sending home to Paris of
      the poor little Queen with all her jewels and her fortune of two hundred
      thousand francs in gold.&nbsp; The King was quite willing to restore the
      young lady, and even the jewels; but he said he really could not part with
      the money.&nbsp; So, at last she was safely deposited at Paris without her
      fortune, and then the Duke of Burgundy (who was cousin to the French King)
      began to quarrel with the Duke of Orleans (who was brother to the French
      King) about the whole matter; and those two dukes made France even more
      wretched than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the idea of conquering Scotland was still popular at home, the King
      marched to the river Tyne and demanded homage of the King of that country.&nbsp;
      This being refused, he advanced to Edinburgh, but did little there; for,
      his army being in want of provisions, and the Scotch being very careful to
      hold him in check without giving battle, he was obliged to retire.&nbsp;
      It is to his immortal honour that in this sally he burnt no villages and
      slaughtered no people, but was particularly careful that his army should
      be merciful and harmless.&nbsp; It was a great example in those ruthless
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      A war among the border people of England and Scotland went on for twelve
      months, and then the Earl of Northumberland, the nobleman who had helped
      Henry to the crown, began to rebel against him&mdash;probably because
      nothing that Henry could do for him would satisfy his extravagant
      expectations.&nbsp; There was a certain Welsh gentleman, named <span
      class="smcap">Owen Glendower</span>, who had been a student in one of the
      Inns of Court, and had afterwards been in the service of the late King,
      whose Welsh property was taken from him by a powerful lord related to the
      present King, who was his neighbour.&nbsp; Appealing for redress, and
      getting none, he took up arms, was made an outlaw, and declared himself
      sovereign of Wales.&nbsp; He pretended to be a magician; and not only were
      the Welsh people stupid enough to believe him, but, even Henry believed
      him too; for, making three expeditions into Wales, and being three times
      driven back by the wildness of the country, the bad weather, and the skill
      of Glendower, he thought he was defeated by the Welshman&rsquo;s magic
      arts.&nbsp; However, he took Lord Grey and Sir Edmund Mortimer, prisoners,
      and allowed the relatives of Lord Grey to ransom him, but would not extend
      such favour to Sir Edmund Mortimer.&nbsp; Now, Henry Percy, called <span
      class="smcap">Hotspur</span>, son of the Earl of Northumberland, who was
      married to Mortimer&rsquo;s sister, is supposed to have taken offence at
      this; and, therefore, in conjunction with his father and some others, to
      have joined Owen Glendower, and risen against Henry.&nbsp; It is by no
      means clear that this was the real cause of the conspiracy; but perhaps it
      was made the pretext.&nbsp; It was formed, and was very powerful;
      including <span class="smcap">Scroop</span>, Archbishop of York, and the
      <span class="smcap">Earl of Douglas</span>, a powerful and brave Scottish
      nobleman.&nbsp; The King was prompt and active, and the two armies met at
      Shrewsbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were about fourteen thousand men in each.&nbsp; The old Earl of
      Northumberland being sick, the rebel forces were led by his son.&nbsp; The
      King wore plain armour to deceive the enemy; and four noblemen, with the
      same object, wore the royal arms.&nbsp; The rebel charge was so furious,
      that every one of those gentlemen was killed, the royal standard was
      beaten down, and the young Prince of Wales was severely wounded in the
      face.&nbsp; But he was one of the bravest and best soldiers that ever
      lived, and he fought so well, and the King&rsquo;s troops were so
      encouraged by his bold example, that they rallied immediately, and cut the
      enemy&rsquo;s forces all to pieces.&nbsp; Hotspur was killed by an arrow
      in the brain, and the rout was so complete that the whole rebellion was
      struck down by this one blow.&nbsp; The Earl of Northumberland surrendered
      himself soon after hearing of the death of his son, and received a pardon
      for all his offences.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some lingerings of rebellion yet: Owen Glendower being retired
      to Wales, and a preposterous story being spread among the ignorant people
      that King Richard was still alive.&nbsp; How they could have believed such
      nonsense it is difficult to imagine; but they certainly did suppose that
      the Court fool of the late King, who was something like him, was he,
      himself; so that it seemed as if, after giving so much trouble to the
      country in his life, he was still to trouble it after his death.&nbsp;
      This was not the worst.&nbsp; The young Earl of March and his brother were
      stolen out of Windsor Castle.&nbsp; Being retaken, and being found to have
      been spirited away by one Lady Spencer, she accused her own brother, that
      Earl of Rutland who was in the former conspiracy and was now Duke of York,
      of being in the plot.&nbsp; For this he was ruined in fortune, though not
      put to death; and then another plot arose among the old Earl of
      Northumberland, some other lords, and that same Scroop, Archbishop of
      York, who was with the rebels before.&nbsp; These conspirators caused a
      writing to be posted on the church doors, accusing the King of a variety
      of crimes; but, the King being eager and vigilant to oppose them, they
      were all taken, and the Archbishop was executed.&nbsp; This was the first
      time that a great churchman had been slain by the law in England; but the
      King was resolved that it should be done, and done it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next most remarkable event of this time was the seizure, by Henry, of
      the heir to the Scottish throne&mdash;James, a boy of nine years old.&nbsp;
      He had been put aboard-ship by his father, the Scottish King Robert, to
      save him from the designs of his uncle, when, on his way to France, he was
      accidentally taken by some English cruisers.&nbsp; He remained a prisoner
      in England for nineteen years, and became in his prison a student and a
      famous poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of occasional troubles with the Welsh and with the
      French, the rest of King Henry&rsquo;s reign was quiet enough.&nbsp; But,
      the King was far from happy, and probably was troubled in his conscience
      by knowing that he had usurped the crown, and had occasioned the death of
      his miserable cousin.&nbsp; The Prince of Wales, though brave and
      generous, is said to have been wild and dissipated, and even to have drawn
      his sword on <span class="smcap">Gascoigne</span>, the Chief Justice of
      the King&rsquo;s Bench, because he was firm in dealing impartially with
      one of his dissolute companions.&nbsp; Upon this the Chief Justice is said
      to have ordered him immediately to prison; the Prince of Wales is said to
      have submitted with a good grace; and the King is said to have exclaimed,
      &lsquo;Happy is the monarch who has so just a judge, and a son so willing
      to obey the laws.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is all very doubtful, and so is
      another story (of which Shakespeare has made beautiful use), that the
      Prince once took the crown out of his father&rsquo;s chamber as he was
      sleeping, and tried it on his own head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King&rsquo;s health sank more and more, and he became subject to
      violent eruptions on the face and to bad epileptic fits, and his spirits
      sank every day.&nbsp; At last, as he was praying before the shrine of St.
      Edward at Westminster Abbey, he was seized with a terrible fit, and was
      carried into the Abbot&rsquo;s chamber, where he presently died.&nbsp; It
      had been foretold that he would die at Jerusalem, which certainly is not,
      and never was, Westminster.&nbsp; But, as the Abbot&rsquo;s room had long
      been called the Jerusalem chamber, people said it was all the same thing,
      and were quite satisfied with the prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King died on the 20th of March, 1413, in the forty-seventh year of his
      age, and the fourteenth of his reign.&nbsp; He was buried in Canterbury
      Cathedral.&nbsp; He had been twice married, and had, by his first wife, a
      family of four sons and two daughters.&nbsp; Considering his duplicity
      before he came to the throne, his unjust seizure of it, and above all, his
      making that monstrous law for the burning of what the priests called
      heretics, he was a reasonably good king, as kings went.

      CHAPTER XXI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIFTH
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FIRST PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Prince of Wales began his reign like a generous and honest man.&nbsp;
      He set the young Earl of March free; he restored their estates and their
      honours to the Percy family, who had lost them by their rebellion against
      his father; he ordered the imbecile and unfortunate Richard to be
      honourably buried among the Kings of England; and he dismissed all his
      wild companions, with assurances that they should not want, if they would
      resolve to be steady, faithful, and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is much easier to burn men than to burn their opinions; and those of
      the Lollards were spreading every day.&nbsp; The Lollards were represented
      by the priests&mdash;probably falsely for the most part&mdash;to entertain
      treasonable designs against the new King; and Henry, suffering himself to
      be worked upon by these representations, sacrificed his friend Sir John
      Oldcastle, the Lord Cobham, to them, after trying in vain to convert him
      by arguments.&nbsp; He was declared guilty, as the head of the sect, and
      sentenced to the flames; but he escaped from the Tower before the day of
      execution (postponed for fifty days by the King himself), and summoned the
      Lollards to meet him near London on a certain day.&nbsp; So the priests
      told the King, at least.&nbsp; I doubt whether there was any conspiracy
      beyond such as was got up by their agents.&nbsp; On the day appointed,
      instead of five-and-twenty thousand men, under the command of Sir John
      Oldcastle, in the meadows of St. Giles, the King found only eighty men,
      and no Sir John at all.&nbsp; There was, in another place, an addle-headed
      brewer, who had gold trappings to his horses, and a pair of gilt spurs in
      his breast&mdash;expecting to be made a knight next day by Sir John, and
      so to gain the right to wear them&mdash;but there was no Sir John, nor did
      anybody give information respecting him, though the King offered great
      rewards for such intelligence.&nbsp; Thirty of these unfortunate Lollards
      were hanged and drawn immediately, and were then burnt, gallows and all;
      and the various prisons in and around London were crammed full of others.&nbsp;
      Some of these unfortunate men made various confessions of treasonable
      designs; but, such confessions were easily got, under torture and the fear
      of fire, and are very little to be trusted.&nbsp; To finish the sad story
      of Sir John Oldcastle at once, I may mention that he escaped into Wales,
      and remained there safely, for four years.&nbsp; When discovered by Lord
      Powis, it is very doubtful if he would have been taken alive&mdash;so
      great was the old soldier&rsquo;s bravery&mdash;if a miserable old woman
      had not come behind him and broken his legs with a stool.&nbsp; He was
      carried to London in a horse-litter, was fastened by an iron chain to a
      gibbet, and so roasted to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the state of France as plain as I can in a few words, I should
      tell you that the Duke of Orleans, and the Duke of Burgundy, commonly
      called &lsquo;John without fear,&rsquo; had had a grand reconciliation of
      their quarrel in the last reign, and had appeared to be quite in a
      heavenly state of mind.&nbsp; Immediately after which, on a Sunday, in the
      public streets of Paris, the Duke of Orleans was murdered by a party of
      twenty men, set on by the Duke of Burgundy&mdash;according to his own
      deliberate confession.&nbsp; The widow of King Richard had been married in
      France to the eldest son of the Duke of Orleans.&nbsp; The poor mad King
      was quite powerless to help her, and the Duke of Burgundy became the real
      master of France.&nbsp; Isabella dying, her husband (Duke of Orleans since
      the death of his father) married the daughter of the Count of Armagnac,
      who, being a much abler man than his young son-in-law, headed his party;
      thence called after him Armagnacs.&nbsp; Thus, France was now in this
      terrible condition, that it had in it the party of the King&rsquo;s son,
      the Dauphin Louis; the party of the Duke of Burgundy, who was the father
      of the Dauphin&rsquo;s ill-used wife; and the party of the Armagnacs; all
      hating each other; all fighting together; all composed of the most
      depraved nobles that the earth has ever known; and all tearing unhappy
      France to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late King had watched these dissensions from England, sensible (like
      the French people) that no enemy of France could injure her more than her
      own nobility.&nbsp; The present King now advanced a claim to the French
      throne.&nbsp; His demand being, of course, refused, he reduced his
      proposal to a certain large amount of French territory, and to demanding
      the French princess, Catherine, in marriage, with a fortune of two
      millions of golden crowns.&nbsp; He was offered less territory and fewer
      crowns, and no princess; but he called his ambassadors home and prepared
      for war.&nbsp; Then, he proposed to take the princess with one million of
      crowns.&nbsp; The French Court replied that he should have the princess
      with two hundred thousand crowns less; he said this would not do (he had
      never seen the princess in his life), and assembled his army at
      Southampton.&nbsp; There was a short plot at home just at that time, for
      deposing him, and making the Earl of March king; but the conspirators were
      all speedily condemned and executed, and the King embarked for France.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is dreadful to observe how long a bad example will be followed; but, it
      is encouraging to know that a good example is never thrown away.&nbsp; The
      King&rsquo;s first act on disembarking at the mouth of the river Seine,
      three miles from Harfleur, was to imitate his father, and to proclaim his
      solemn orders that the lives and property of the peaceable inhabitants
      should be respected on pain of death.&nbsp; It is agreed by French
      writers, to his lasting renown, that even while his soldiers were
      suffering the greatest distress from want of food, these commands were
      rigidly obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an army in all of thirty thousand men, he besieged the town of
      Harfleur both by sea and land for five weeks; at the end of which time the
      town surrendered, and the inhabitants were allowed to depart with only
      fivepence each, and a part of their clothes.&nbsp; All the rest of their
      possessions was divided amongst the English army.&nbsp; But, that army
      suffered so much, in spite of its successes, from disease and privation,
      that it was already reduced one half.&nbsp; Still, the King was determined
      not to retire until he had struck a greater blow.&nbsp; Therefore, against
      the advice of all his counsellors, he moved on with his little force
      towards Calais.&nbsp; When he came up to the river Somme he was unable to
      cross, in consequence of the fort being fortified; and, as the English
      moved up the left bank of the river looking for a crossing, the French,
      who had broken all the bridges, moved up the right bank, watching them,
      and waiting to attack them when they should try to pass it.&nbsp; At last
      the English found a crossing and got safely over.&nbsp; The French held a
      council of war at Rouen, resolved to give the English battle, and sent
      heralds to King Henry to know by which road he was going.&nbsp; &lsquo;By
      the road that will take me straight to Calais!&rsquo; said the King, and
      sent them away with a present of a hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English moved on, until they beheld the French, and then the King gave
      orders to form in line of battle.&nbsp; The French not coming on, the army
      broke up after remaining in battle array till night, and got good rest and
      refreshment at a neighbouring village.&nbsp; The French were now all lying
      in another village, through which they knew the English must pass.&nbsp;
      They were resolved that the English should begin the battle.&nbsp; The
      English had no means of retreat, if their King had any such intention; and
      so the two armies passed the night, close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand these armies well, you must bear in mind that the immense
      French army had, among its notable persons, almost the whole of that
      wicked nobility, whose debauchery had made France a desert; and so
      besotted were they by pride, and by contempt for the common people, that
      they had scarcely any bowmen (if indeed they had any at all) in their
      whole enormous number: which, compared with the English army, was at least
      as six to one.&nbsp; For these proud fools had said that the bow was not a
      fit weapon for knightly hands, and that France must be defended by
      gentlemen only.&nbsp; We shall see, presently, what hand the gentlemen
      made of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on the English side, among the little force, there was a good
      proportion of men who were not gentlemen by any means, but who were good
      stout archers for all that.&nbsp; Among them, in the morning&mdash;having
      slept little at night, while the French were carousing and making sure of
      victory&mdash;the King rode, on a grey horse; wearing on his head a helmet
      of shining steel, surmounted by a crown of gold, sparkling with precious
      stones; and bearing over his armour, embroidered together, the arms of
      England and the arms of France.&nbsp; The archers looked at the shining
      helmet and the crown of gold and the sparkling jewels, and admired them
      all; but, what they admired most was the King&rsquo;s cheerful face, and
      his bright blue eye, as he told them that, for himself, he had made up his
      mind to conquer there or to die there, and that England should never have
      a ransom to pay for <i>him</i>.&nbsp; There was one brave knight who
      chanced to say that he wished some of the many gallant gentlemen and good
      soldiers, who were then idle at home in England, were there to increase
      their numbers.&nbsp; But the King told him that, for his part, he did not
      wish for one more man.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fewer we have,&rsquo; said he,
      &lsquo;the greater will be the honour we shall win!&rsquo;&nbsp; His men,
      being now all in good heart, were refreshed with bread and wine, and heard
      prayers, and waited quietly for the French.&nbsp; The King waited for the
      French, because they were drawn up thirty deep (the little English force
      was only three deep), on very difficult and heavy ground; and he knew that
      when they moved, there must be confusion among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they did not move, he sent off two parties:&mdash;one to lie concealed
      in a wood on the left of the French: the other, to set fire to some houses
      behind the French after the battle should be begun.&nbsp; This was
      scarcely done, when three of the proud French gentlemen, who were to
      defend their country without any help from the base peasants, came riding
      out, calling upon the English to surrender.&nbsp; The King warned those
      gentlemen himself to retire with all speed if they cared for their lives,
      and ordered the English banners to advance.&nbsp; Upon that, Sir Thomas
      Erpingham, a great English general, who commanded the archers, threw his
      truncheon into the air, joyfully, and all the English men, kneeling down
      upon the ground and biting it as if they took possession of the country,
      rose up with a great shout and fell upon the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every archer was furnished with a great stake tipped with iron; and his
      orders were, to thrust this stake into the ground, to discharge his arrow,
      and then to fall back, when the French horsemen came on.&nbsp; As the
      haughty French gentlemen, who were to break the English archers and
      utterly destroy them with their knightly lances, came riding up, they were
      received with such a blinding storm of arrows, that they broke and turned.&nbsp;
      Horses and men rolled over one another, and the confusion was terrific.&nbsp;
      Those who rallied and charged the archers got among the stakes on slippery
      and boggy ground, and were so bewildered that the English archers&mdash;who
      wore no armour, and even took off their leathern coats to be more active&mdash;cut
      them to pieces, root and branch.&nbsp; Only three French horsemen got
      within the stakes, and those were instantly despatched.&nbsp; All this
      time the dense French army, being in armour, were sinking knee-deep into
      the mire; while the light English archers, half-naked, were as fresh and
      active as if they were fighting on a marble floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, the second division of the French coming to the relief of the
      first, closed up in a firm mass; the English, headed by the King, attacked
      them; and the deadliest part of the battle began.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s
      brother, the Duke of Clarence, was struck down, and numbers of the French
      surrounded him; but, King Henry, standing over the body, fought like a
      lion until they were beaten off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, came up a band of eighteen French knights, bearing the banner
      of a certain French lord, who had sworn to kill or take the English King.&nbsp;
      One of them struck him such a blow with a battle-axe that he reeled and
      fell upon his knees; but, his faithful men, immediately closing round him,
      killed every one of those eighteen knights, and so that French lord never
      kept his oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, seeing this, made a desperate charge,
      and cut his way close up to the Royal Standard of England.&nbsp; He beat
      down the Duke of York, who was standing near it; and, when the King came
      to his rescue, struck off a piece of the crown he wore.&nbsp; But, he
      never struck another blow in this world; for, even as he was in the act of
      saying who he was, and that he surrendered to the King; and even as the
      King stretched out his hand to give him a safe and honourable acceptance
      of the offer; he fell dead, pierced by innumerable wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of this nobleman decided the battle.&nbsp; The third division of
      the French army, which had never struck a blow yet, and which was, in
      itself, more than double the whole English power, broke and fled.&nbsp; At
      this time of the fight, the English, who as yet had made no prisoners,
      began to take them in immense numbers, and were still occupied in doing
      so, or in killing those who would not surrender, when a great noise arose
      in the rear of the French&mdash;their flying banners were seen to stop&mdash;and
      King Henry, supposing a great reinforcement to have arrived, gave orders
      that all the prisoners should be put to death.&nbsp; As soon, however, as
      it was found that the noise was only occasioned by a body of plundering
      peasants, the terrible massacre was stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then King Henry called to him the French herald, and asked him to whom the
      victory belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The herald replied, &lsquo;To the King of England.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>We</i> have not made this havoc and slaughter,&rsquo; said the
      King.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the wrath of Heaven on the sins of France.&nbsp;
      What is the name of that castle yonder?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The herald answered him, &lsquo;My lord, it is the castle of Azincourt.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      Said the King, &lsquo;From henceforth this battle shall be known to
      posterity, by the name of the battle of Azincourt.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Our English historians have made it Agincourt; but, under that name, it
      will ever be famous in English annals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss upon the French side was enormous.&nbsp; Three Dukes were killed,
      two more were taken prisoners, seven Counts were killed, three more were
      taken prisoners, and ten thousand knights and gentlemen were slain upon
      the field.&nbsp; The English loss amounted to sixteen hundred men, among
      whom were the Duke of York and the Earl of Suffolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      War is a dreadful thing; and it is appalling to know how the English were
      obliged, next morning, to kill those prisoners mortally wounded, who yet
      writhed in agony upon the ground; how the dead upon the French side were
      stripped by their own countrymen and countrywomen, and afterwards buried
      in great pits; how the dead upon the English side were piled up in a great
      barn, and how their bodies and the barn were all burned together.&nbsp; It
      is in such things, and in many more much too horrible to relate, that the
      real desolation and wickedness of war consist.&nbsp; Nothing can make war
      otherwise than horrible.&nbsp; But the dark side of it was little thought
      of and soon forgotten; and it cast no shade of trouble on the English
      people, except on those who had lost friends or relations in the fight.&nbsp;
      They welcomed their King home with shouts of rejoicing, and plunged into
      the water to bear him ashore on their shoulders, and flocked out in crowds
      to welcome him in every town through which he passed, and hung rich
      carpets and tapestries out of the windows, and strewed the streets with
      flowers, and made the fountains run with wine, as the great field of
      Agincourt had run with blood.
    </p>
    <h3>
      SECOND PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      That proud and wicked French nobility who dragged their country to
      destruction, and who were every day and every year regarded with deeper
      hatred and detestation in the hearts of the French people, learnt nothing,
      even from the defeat of Agincourt.&nbsp; So far from uniting against the
      common enemy, they became, among themselves, more violent, more bloody,
      and more false&mdash;if that were possible&mdash;than they had been
      before.&nbsp; The Count of Armagnac persuaded the French king to plunder
      of her treasures Queen Isabella of Bavaria, and to make her a prisoner.&nbsp;
      She, who had hitherto been the bitter enemy of the Duke of Burgundy,
      proposed to join him, in revenge.&nbsp; He carried her off to Troyes,
      where she proclaimed herself Regent of France, and made him her
      lieutenant.&nbsp; The Armagnac party were at that time possessed of Paris;
      but, one of the gates of the city being secretly opened on a certain night
      to a party of the duke&rsquo;s men, they got into Paris, threw into the
      prisons all the Armagnacs upon whom they could lay their hands, and, a few
      nights afterwards, with the aid of a furious mob of sixty thousand people,
      broke the prisons open, and killed them all.&nbsp; The former Dauphin was
      now dead, and the King&rsquo;s third son bore the title.&nbsp; Him, in the
      height of this murderous scene, a French knight hurried out of bed,
      wrapped in a sheet, and bore away to Poitiers.&nbsp; So, when the
      revengeful Isabella and the Duke of Burgundy entered Paris in triumph
      after the slaughter of their enemies, the Dauphin was proclaimed at
      Poitiers as the real Regent.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Henry had not been idle since his victory of Agincourt, but had
      repulsed a brave attempt of the French to recover Harfleur; had gradually
      conquered a great part of Normandy; and, at this crisis of affairs, took
      the important town of Rouen, after a siege of half a year.&nbsp; This
      great loss so alarmed the French, that the Duke of Burgundy proposed that
      a meeting to treat of peace should be held between the French and the
      English kings in a plain by the river Seine.&nbsp; On the appointed day,
      King Henry appeared there, with his two brothers, Clarence and Gloucester,
      and a thousand men.&nbsp; The unfortunate French King, being more mad than
      usual that day, could not come; but the Queen came, and with her the
      Princess Catherine: who was a very lovely creature, and who made a real
      impression on King Henry, now that he saw her for the first time.&nbsp;
      This was the most important circumstance that arose out of the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if it were impossible for a French nobleman of that time to be true to
      his word of honour in anything, Henry discovered that the Duke of Burgundy
      was, at that very moment, in secret treaty with the Dauphin; and he
      therefore abandoned the negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin, each of whom with the best reason
      distrusted the other as a noble ruffian surrounded by a party of noble
      ruffians, were rather at a loss how to proceed after this; but, at length
      they agreed to meet, on a bridge over the river Yonne, where it was
      arranged that there should be two strong gates put up, with an empty space
      between them; and that the Duke of Burgundy should come into that space by
      one gate, with ten men only; and that the Dauphin should come into that
      space by the other gate, also with ten men, and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far the Dauphin kept his word, but no farther.&nbsp; When the Duke of
      Burgundy was on his knee before him in the act of speaking, one of the
      Dauphin&rsquo;s noble ruffians cut the said duke down with a small axe,
      and others speedily finished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain for the Dauphin to pretend that this base murder was not
      done with his consent; it was too bad, even for France, and caused a
      general horror.&nbsp; The duke&rsquo;s heir hastened to make a treaty with
      King Henry, and the French Queen engaged that her husband should consent
      to it, whatever it was.&nbsp; Henry made peace, on condition of receiving
      the Princess Catherine in marriage, and being made Regent of France during
      the rest of the King&rsquo;s lifetime, and succeeding to the French crown
      at his death.&nbsp; He was soon married to the beautiful Princess, and
      took her proudly home to England, where she was crowned with great honour
      and glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This peace was called the Perpetual Peace; we shall soon see how long it
      lasted.&nbsp; It gave great satisfaction to the French people, although
      they were so poor and miserable, that, at the time of the celebration of
      the Royal marriage, numbers of them were dying with starvation, on the
      dunghills in the streets of Paris.&nbsp; There was some resistance on the
      part of the Dauphin in some few parts of France, but King Henry beat it
      all down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, with his great possessions in France secured, and his beautiful
      wife to cheer him, and a son born to give him greater happiness, all
      appeared bright before him.&nbsp; But, in the fulness of his triumph and
      the height of his power, Death came upon him, and his day was done.&nbsp;
      When he fell ill at Vincennes, and found that he could not recover, he was
      very calm and quiet, and spoke serenely to those who wept around his bed.&nbsp;
      His wife and child, he said, he left to the loving care of his brother the
      Duke of Bedford, and his other faithful nobles.&nbsp; He gave them his
      advice that England should establish a friendship with the new Duke of
      Burgundy, and offer him the regency of France; that it should not set free
      the royal princes who had been taken at Agincourt; and that, whatever
      quarrel might arise with France, England should never make peace without
      holding Normandy.&nbsp; Then, he laid down his head, and asked the
      attendant priests to chant the penitential psalms.&nbsp; Amid which solemn
      sounds, on the thirty-first of August, one thousand four hundred and
      twenty-two, in only the thirty-fourth year of his age and the tenth of his
      reign, King Henry the Fifth passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and mournfully they carried his embalmed body in a procession of
      great state to Paris, and thence to Rouen where his Queen was: from whom
      the sad intelligence of his death was concealed until he had been dead
      some days.&nbsp; Thence, lying on a bed of crimson and gold, with a golden
      crown upon the head, and a golden ball and sceptre lying in the nerveless
      hands, they carried it to Calais, with such a great retinue as seemed to
      dye the road black.&nbsp; The King of Scotland acted as chief mourner, all
      the Royal Household followed, the knights wore black armour and black
      plumes of feathers, crowds of men bore torches, making the night as light
      as day; and the widowed Princess followed last of all.&nbsp; At Calais
      there was a fleet of ships to bring the funeral host to Dover.&nbsp; And
      so, by way of London Bridge, where the service for the dead was chanted as
      it passed along, they brought the body to Westminster Abbey, and there
      buried it with great respect.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SIXTH
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PART THE FIRST
    </h3>
    <p>
      It had been the wish of the late King, that while his infant son <span
      class="smcap">King Henry the Sixth</span>, at this time only nine months
      old, was under age, the Duke of Gloucester should be appointed Regent.&nbsp;
      The English Parliament, however, preferred to appoint a Council of
      Regency, with the Duke of Bedford at its head: to be represented, in his
      absence only, by the Duke of Gloucester.&nbsp; The Parliament would seem
      to have been wise in this, for Gloucester soon showed himself to be
      ambitious and troublesome, and, in the gratification of his own personal
      schemes, gave dangerous offence to the Duke of Burgundy, which was with
      difficulty adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As that duke declined the Regency of France, it was bestowed by the poor
      French King upon the Duke of Bedford.&nbsp; But, the French King dying
      within two months, the Dauphin instantly asserted his claim to the French
      throne, and was actually crowned under the title of <span class="smcap">Charles
      the Seventh</span>.&nbsp; The Duke of Bedford, to be a match for him,
      entered into a friendly league with the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany,
      and gave them his two sisters in marriage.&nbsp; War with France was
      immediately renewed, and the Perpetual Peace came to an untimely end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first campaign, the English, aided by this alliance, were speedily
      successful.&nbsp; As Scotland, however, had sent the French five thousand
      men, and might send more, or attack the North of England while England was
      busy with France, it was considered that it would be a good thing to offer
      the Scottish King, James, who had been so long imprisoned, his liberty, on
      his paying forty thousand pounds for his board and lodging during nineteen
      years, and engaging to forbid his subjects from serving under the flag of
      France.&nbsp; It is pleasant to know, not only that the amiable captive at
      last regained his freedom upon these terms, but, that he married a noble
      English lady, with whom he had been long in love, and became an excellent
      King.&nbsp; I am afraid we have met with some Kings in this history, and
      shall meet with some more, who would have been very much the better, and
      would have left the world much happier, if they had been imprisoned
      nineteen years too.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second campaign, the English gained a considerable victory at
      Verneuil, in a battle which was chiefly remarkable, otherwise, for their
      resorting to the odd expedient of tying their baggage-horses together by
      the heads and tails, and jumbling them up with the baggage, so as to
      convert them into a sort of live fortification&mdash;which was found
      useful to the troops, but which I should think was not agreeable to the
      horses.&nbsp; For three years afterwards very little was done, owing to
      both sides being too poor for war, which is a very expensive
      entertainment; but, a council was then held in Paris, in which it was
      decided to lay siege to the town of Orleans, which was a place of great
      importance to the Dauphin&rsquo;s cause.&nbsp; An English army of ten
      thousand men was despatched on this service, under the command of the Earl
      of Salisbury, a general of fame.&nbsp; He being unfortunately killed early
      in the siege, the Earl of Suffolk took his place; under whom (reinforced
      by <span class="smcap">Sir John Falstaff</span>, who brought up four
      hundred waggons laden with salt herrings and other provisions for the
      troops, and, beating off the French who tried to intercept him, came
      victorious out of a hot skirmish, which was afterwards called in jest the
      Battle of the Herrings) the town of Orleans was so completely hemmed in,
      that the besieged proposed to yield it up to their countryman the Duke of
      Burgundy.&nbsp; The English general, however, replied that his English men
      had won it, so far, by their blood and valour, and that his English men
      must have it.&nbsp; There seemed to be no hope for the town, or for the
      Dauphin, who was so dismayed that he even thought of flying to Scotland or
      to Spain&mdash;when a peasant girl rose up and changed the whole state of
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of this peasant girl I have now to tell.
    </p>
    <h3>
      PART THE SECOND: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC
    </h3>
    <p>
      In a remote village among some wild hills in the province of Lorraine,
      there lived a countryman whose name was <span class="smcap">Jacques d&rsquo;Arc</span>.&nbsp;
      He had a daughter, <span class="smcap">Joan of Arc</span>, who was at this
      time in her twentieth year.&nbsp; She had been a solitary girl from her
      childhood; she had often tended sheep and cattle for whole days where no
      human figure was seen or human voice heard; and she had often knelt, for
      hours together, in the gloomy, empty, little village chapel, looking up at
      the altar and at the dim lamp burning before it, until she fancied that
      she saw shadowy figures standing there, and even that she heard them speak
      to her.&nbsp; The people in that part of France were very ignorant and
      superstitious, and they had many ghostly tales to tell about what they had
      dreamed, and what they saw among the lonely hills when the clouds and the
      mists were resting on them.&nbsp; So, they easily believed that Joan saw
      strange sights, and they whispered among themselves that angels and
      spirits talked to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Joan told her father that she had one day been surprised by a
      great unearthly light, and had afterwards heard a solemn voice, which said
      it was Saint Michael&rsquo;s voice, telling her that she was to go and
      help the Dauphin.&nbsp; Soon after this (she said), Saint Catherine and
      Saint Margaret had appeared to her with sparkling crowns upon their heads,
      and had encouraged her to be virtuous and resolute.&nbsp; These visions
      had returned sometimes; but the Voices very often; and the voices always
      said, &lsquo;Joan, thou art appointed by Heaven to go and help the
      Dauphin!&rsquo;&nbsp; She almost always heard them while the chapel bells
      were ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt, now, that Joan believed she saw and heard these things.&nbsp;
      It is very well known that such delusions are a disease which is not by
      any means uncommon.&nbsp; It is probable enough that there were figures of
      Saint Michael, and Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, in the little
      chapel (where they would be very likely to have shining crowns upon their
      heads), and that they first gave Joan the idea of those three personages.&nbsp;
      She had long been a moping, fanciful girl, and, though she was a very good
      girl, I dare say she was a little vain, and wishful for notoriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father, something wiser than his neighbours, said, &lsquo;I tell thee,
      Joan, it is thy fancy.&nbsp; Thou hadst better have a kind husband to take
      care of thee, girl, and work to employ thy mind!&rsquo;&nbsp; But Joan
      told him in reply, that she had taken a vow never to have a husband, and
      that she must go as Heaven directed her, to help the Dauphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, unfortunately for her father&rsquo;s persuasions, and most
      unfortunately for the poor girl, too, that a party of the Dauphin&rsquo;s
      enemies found their way into the village while Joan&rsquo;s disorder was
      at this point, and burnt the chapel, and drove out the inhabitants.&nbsp;
      The cruelties she saw committed, touched Joan&rsquo;s heart and made her
      worse.&nbsp; She said that the voices and the figures were now continually
      with her; that they told her she was the girl who, according to an old
      prophecy, was to deliver France; and she must go and help the Dauphin, and
      must remain with him until he should be crowned at Rheims: and that she
      must travel a long way to a certain lord named <span class="smcap">Baudricourt</span>,
      who could and would, bring her into the Dauphin&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her father still said, &lsquo;I tell thee, Joan, it is thy fancy,&rsquo;
      she set off to find out this lord, accompanied by an uncle, a poor village
      wheelwright and cart-maker, who believed in the reality of her visions.&nbsp;
      They travelled a long way and went on and on, over a rough country, full
      of the Duke of Burgundy&rsquo;s men, and of all kinds of robbers and
      marauders, until they came to where this lord was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his servants told him that there was a poor peasant girl named Joan
      of Arc, accompanied by nobody but an old village wheelwright and
      cart-maker, who wished to see him because she was commanded to help the
      Dauphin and save France, Baudricourt burst out a-laughing, and bade them
      send the girl away.&nbsp; But, he soon heard so much about her lingering
      in the town, and praying in the churches, and seeing visions, and doing
      harm to no one, that he sent for her, and questioned her.&nbsp; As she
      said the same things after she had been well sprinkled with holy water as
      she had said before the sprinkling, Baudricourt began to think there might
      be something in it.&nbsp; At all events, he thought it worth while to send
      her on to the town of Chinon, where the Dauphin was.&nbsp; So, he bought
      her a horse, and a sword, and gave her two squires to conduct her.&nbsp;
      As the Voices had told Joan that she was to wear a man&rsquo;s dress, now,
      she put one on, and girded her sword to her side, and bound spurs to her
      heels, and mounted her horse and rode away with her two squires.&nbsp; As
      to her uncle the wheelwright, he stood staring at his niece in wonder
      until she was out of sight&mdash;as well he might&mdash;and then went home
      again.&nbsp; The best place, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan and her two squires rode on and on, until they came to Chinon, where
      she was, after some doubt, admitted into the Dauphin&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp;
      Picking him out immediately from all his court, she told him that she came
      commanded by Heaven to subdue his enemies and conduct him to his
      coronation at Rheims.&nbsp; She also told him (or he pretended so
      afterwards, to make the greater impression upon his soldiers) a number of
      his secrets known only to himself, and, furthermore, she said there was an
      old, old sword in the cathedral of Saint Catherine at Fierbois, marked
      with five old crosses on the blade, which Saint Catherine had ordered her
      to wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, nobody knew anything about this old, old sword, but when the
      cathedral came to be examined&mdash;which was immediately done&mdash;there,
      sure enough, the sword was found!&nbsp; The Dauphin then required a number
      of grave priests and bishops to give him their opinion whether the girl
      derived her power from good spirits or from evil spirits, which they held
      prodigiously long debates about, in the course of which several learned
      men fell fast asleep and snored loudly.&nbsp; At last, when one gruff old
      gentleman had said to Joan, &lsquo;What language do your Voices speak?&rsquo;
      and when Joan had replied to the gruff old gentleman, &lsquo;A pleasanter
      language than yours,&rsquo; they agreed that it was all correct, and that
      Joan of Arc was inspired from Heaven.&nbsp; This wonderful circumstance
      put new heart into the Dauphin&rsquo;s soldiers when they heard of it, and
      dispirited the English army, who took Joan for a witch.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Joan mounted horse again, and again rode on and on, until she came to
      Orleans.&nbsp; But she rode now, as never peasant girl had ridden yet.&nbsp;
      She rode upon a white war-horse, in a suit of glittering armour; with the
      old, old sword from the cathedral, newly burnished, in her belt; with a
      white flag carried before her, upon which were a picture of God, and the
      words <span class="smcap">Jesus Maria</span>.&nbsp; In this splendid
      state, at the head of a great body of troops escorting provisions of all
      kinds for the starving inhabitants of Orleans, she appeared before that
      beleaguered city.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the people on the walls beheld her, they cried out &lsquo;The Maid is
      come!&nbsp; The Maid of the Prophecy is come to deliver us!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      And this, and the sight of the Maid fighting at the head of their men,
      made the French so bold, and made the English so fearful, that the English
      line of forts was soon broken, the troops and provisions were got into the
      town, and Orleans was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan, henceforth called <span class="smcap">The Maid of Orleans</span>,
      remained within the walls for a few days, and caused letters to be thrown
      over, ordering Lord Suffolk and his Englishmen to depart from before the
      town according to the will of Heaven.&nbsp; As the English general very
      positively declined to believe that Joan knew anything about the will of
      Heaven (which did not mend the matter with his soldiers, for they stupidly
      said if she were not inspired she was a witch, and it was of no use to
      fight against a witch), she mounted her white war-horse again, and ordered
      her white banner to advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The besiegers held the bridge, and some strong towers upon the bridge; and
      here the Maid of Orleans attacked them.&nbsp; The fight was fourteen hours
      long.&nbsp; She planted a scaling ladder with her own hands, and mounted a
      tower wall, but was struck by an English arrow in the neck, and fell into
      the trench.&nbsp; She was carried away and the arrow was taken out, during
      which operation she screamed and cried with the pain, as any other girl
      might have done; but presently she said that the Voices were speaking to
      her and soothing her to rest.&nbsp; After a while, she got up, and was
      again foremost in the fight.&nbsp; When the English who had seen her fall
      and supposed her dead, saw this, they were troubled with the strangest
      fears, and some of them cried out that they beheld Saint Michael on a
      white horse (probably Joan herself) fighting for the French.&nbsp; They
      lost the bridge, and lost the towers, and next day set their chain of
      forts on fire, and left the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Lord Suffolk himself retired no farther than the town of Jargeau,
      which was only a few miles off, the Maid of Orleans besieged him there,
      and he was taken prisoner.&nbsp; As the white banner scaled the wall, she
      was struck upon the head with a stone, and was again tumbled down into the
      ditch; but, she only cried all the more, as she lay there, &lsquo;On, on,
      my countrymen!&nbsp; And fear nothing, for the Lord hath delivered them
      into our hands!&rsquo;&nbsp; After this new success of the Maid&rsquo;s,
      several other fortresses and places which had previously held out against
      the Dauphin were delivered up without a battle; and at Patay she defeated
      the remainder of the English army, and set up her victorious white banner
      on a field where twelve hundred Englishmen lay dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now urged the Dauphin (who always kept out of the way when there was
      any fighting) to proceed to Rheims, as the first part of her mission was
      accomplished; and to complete the whole by being crowned there.&nbsp; The
      Dauphin was in no particular hurry to do this, as Rheims was a long way
      off, and the English and the Duke of Burgundy were still strong in the
      country through which the road lay.&nbsp; However, they set forth, with
      ten thousand men, and again the Maid of Orleans rode on and on, upon her
      white war-horse, and in her shining armour.&nbsp; Whenever they came to a
      town which yielded readily, the soldiers believed in her; but, whenever
      they came to a town which gave them any trouble, they began to murmur that
      she was an impostor.&nbsp; The latter was particularly the case at Troyes,
      which finally yielded, however, through the persuasion of one Richard, a
      friar of the place.&nbsp; Friar Richard was in the old doubt about the
      Maid of Orleans, until he had sprinkled her well with holy water, and had
      also well sprinkled the threshold of the gate by which she came into the
      city.&nbsp; Finding that it made no change in her or the gate, he said, as
      the other grave old gentlemen had said, that it was all right, and became
      her great ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, at last, by dint of riding on and on, the Maid of Orleans, and the
      Dauphin, and the ten thousand sometimes believing and sometimes
      unbelieving men, came to Rheims.&nbsp; And in the great cathedral of
      Rheims, the Dauphin actually was crowned Charles the Seventh in a great
      assembly of the people.&nbsp; Then, the Maid, who with her white banner
      stood beside the King in that hour of his triumph, kneeled down upon the
      pavement at his feet, and said, with tears, that what she had been
      inspired to do, was done, and that the only recompense she asked for, was,
      that she should now have leave to go back to her distant home, and her
      sturdily incredulous father, and her first simple escort the village
      wheelwright and cart-maker.&nbsp; But the King said &lsquo;No!&rsquo; and
      made her and her family as noble as a King could, and settled upon her the
      income of a Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! happy had it been for the Maid of Orleans, if she had resumed her
      rustic dress that day, and had gone home to the little chapel and the wild
      hills, and had forgotten all these things, and had been a good man&rsquo;s
      wife, and had heard no stranger voices than the voices of little children!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be, and she continued helping the King (she did a world for
      him, in alliance with Friar Richard), and trying to improve the lives of
      the coarse soldiers, and leading a religious, an unselfish, and a modest
      life, herself, beyond any doubt.&nbsp; Still, many times she prayed the
      King to let her go home; and once she even took off her bright armour and
      hung it up in a church, meaning never to wear it more.&nbsp; But, the King
      always won her back again&mdash;while she was of any use to him&mdash;and
      so she went on and on and on, to her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Duke of Bedford, who was a very able man, began to be active for
      England, and, by bringing the war back into France and by holding the Duke
      of Burgundy to his faith, to distress and disturb Charles very much,
      Charles sometimes asked the Maid of Orleans what the Voices said about it?&nbsp;
      But, the Voices had become (very like ordinary voices in perplexed times)
      contradictory and confused, so that now they said one thing, and now said
      another, and the Maid lost credit every day.&nbsp; Charles marched on
      Paris, which was opposed to him, and attacked the suburb of Saint Honor&eacute;.&nbsp;
      In this fight, being again struck down into the ditch, she was abandoned
      by the whole army.&nbsp; She lay unaided among a heap of dead, and crawled
      out how she could.&nbsp; Then, some of her believers went over to an
      opposition Maid, Catherine of La Rochelle, who said she was inspired to
      tell where there were treasures of buried money&mdash;though she never did&mdash;and
      then Joan accidentally broke the old, old sword, and others said that her
      power was broken with it.&nbsp; Finally, at the siege of Compi&egrave;gne,
      held by the Duke of Burgundy, where she did valiant service, she was
      basely left alone in a retreat, though facing about and fighting to the
      last; and an archer pulled her off her horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      O the uproar that was made, and the thanksgivings that were sung, about
      the capture of this one poor country-girl!&nbsp; O the way in which she
      was demanded to be tried for sorcery and heresy, and anything else you
      like, by the Inquisitor-General of France, and by this great man, and by
      that great man, until it is wearisome to think of! She was bought at last
      by the Bishop of Beauvais for ten thousand francs, and was shut up in her
      narrow prison: plain Joan of Arc again, and Maid of Orleans no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should never have done if I were to tell you how they had Joan out to
      examine her, and cross-examine her, and re-examine her, and worry her into
      saying anything and everything; and how all sorts of scholars and doctors
      bestowed their utmost tediousness upon her.&nbsp; Sixteen times she was
      brought out and shut up again, and worried, and entrapped, and argued
      with, until she was heart-sick of the dreary business.&nbsp; On the last
      occasion of this kind she was brought into a burial-place at Rouen,
      dismally decorated with a scaffold, and a stake and faggots, and the
      executioner, and a pulpit with a friar therein, and an awful sermon ready.&nbsp;
      It is very affecting to know that even at that pass the poor girl honoured
      the mean vermin of a King, who had so used her for his purposes and so
      abandoned her; and, that while she had been regardless of reproaches
      heaped upon herself, she spoke out courageously for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural in one so young to hold to life.&nbsp; To save her life,
      she signed a declaration prepared for her&mdash;signed it with a cross,
      for she couldn&rsquo;t write&mdash;that all her visions and Voices had
      come from the Devil.&nbsp; Upon her recanting the past, and protesting
      that she would never wear a man&rsquo;s dress in future, she was condemned
      to imprisonment for life, &lsquo;on the bread of sorrow and the water of
      affliction.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction, the visions and
      the Voices soon returned.&nbsp; It was quite natural that they should do
      so, for that kind of disease is much aggravated by fasting, loneliness,
      and anxiety of mind.&nbsp; It was not only got out of Joan that she
      considered herself inspired again, but, she was taken in a man&rsquo;s
      dress, which had been left&mdash;to entrap her&mdash;in her prison, and
      which she put on, in her solitude; perhaps, in remembrance of her past
      glories, perhaps, because the imaginary Voices told her.&nbsp; For this
      relapse into the sorcery and heresy and anything else you like, she was
      sentenced to be burnt to death.&nbsp; And, in the market-place of Rouen,
      in the hideous dress which the monks had invented for such spectacles;
      with priests and bishops sitting in a gallery looking on, though some had
      the Christian grace to go away, unable to endure the infamous scene; this
      shrieking girl&mdash;last seen amidst the smoke and fire, holding a
      crucifix between her hands; last heard, calling upon Christ&mdash;was
      burnt to ashes.&nbsp; They threw her ashes into the river Seine; but they
      will rise against her murderers on the last day.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment of her capture, neither the French King nor one single man
      in all his court raised a finger to save her.&nbsp; It is no defence of
      them that they may have never really believed in her, or that they may
      have won her victories by their skill and bravery.&nbsp; The more they
      pretended to believe in her, the more they had caused her to believe in
      herself; and she had ever been true to them, ever brave, ever nobly
      devoted.&nbsp; But, it is no wonder, that they, who were in all things
      false to themselves, false to one another, false to their country, false
      to Heaven, false to Earth, should be monsters of ingratitude and treachery
      to a helpless peasant girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the picturesque old town of Rouen, where weeds and grass grow high on
      the cathedral towers, and the venerable Norman streets are still warm in
      the blessed sunlight though the monkish fires that once gleamed horribly
      upon them have long grown cold, there is a statue of Joan of Arc, in the
      scene of her last agony, the square to which she has given its present
      name.&nbsp; I know some statues of modern times&mdash;even in the World&rsquo;s
      metropolis, I think&mdash;which commemorate less constancy, less
      earnestness, smaller claims upon the world&rsquo;s attention, and much
      greater impostors.
    </p>

      PART THE THIRD

      Bad deeds seldom prosper, happily for mankind; and the English cause
      gained no advantage from the cruel death of Joan of Arc.&nbsp; For a long
      time, the war went heavily on.&nbsp; The Duke of Bedford died; the
      alliance with the Duke of Burgundy was broken; and Lord Talbot became a
      great general on the English side in France.&nbsp; But, two of the
      consequences of wars are, Famine&mdash;because the people cannot
      peacefully cultivate the ground&mdash;and Pestilence, which comes of want,
      misery, and suffering.&nbsp; Both these horrors broke out in both
      countries, and lasted for two wretched years.&nbsp; Then, the war went on
      again, and came by slow degrees to be so badly conducted by the English
      government, that, within twenty years from the execution of the Maid of
      Orleans, of all the great French conquests, the town of Calais alone
      remained in English hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these victories and defeats were taking place in the course of time,
      many strange things happened at home.&nbsp; The young King, as he grew up,
      proved to be very unlike his great father, and showed himself a miserable
      puny creature.&nbsp; There was no harm in him&mdash;he had a great
      aversion to shedding blood: which was something&mdash;but, he was a weak,
      silly, helpless young man, and a mere shuttlecock to the great lordly
      battledores about the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these battledores, Cardinal Beaufort, a relation of the King, and the
      Duke of Gloucester, were at first the most powerful.&nbsp; The Duke of
      Gloucester had a wife, who was nonsensically accused of practising
      witchcraft to cause the King&rsquo;s death and lead to her husband&rsquo;s
      coming to the throne, he being the next heir.&nbsp; She was charged with
      having, by the help of a ridiculous old woman named Margery (who was
      called a witch), made a little waxen doll in the King&rsquo;s likeness,
      and put it before a slow fire that it might gradually melt away.&nbsp; It
      was supposed, in such cases, that the death of the person whom the doll
      was made to represent, was sure to happen.&nbsp; Whether the duchess was
      as ignorant as the rest of them, and really did make such a doll with such
      an intention, I don&rsquo;t know; but, you and I know very well that she
      might have made a thousand dolls, if she had been stupid enough, and might
      have melted them all, without hurting the King or anybody else.&nbsp;
      However, she was tried for it, and so was old Margery, and so was one of
      the duke&rsquo;s chaplains, who was charged with having assisted them.&nbsp;
      Both he and Margery were put to death, and the duchess, after being taken
      on foot and bearing a lighted candle, three times round the City, as a
      penance, was imprisoned for life.&nbsp; The duke, himself, took all this
      pretty quietly, and made as little stir about the matter as if he were
      rather glad to be rid of the duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, he was not destined to keep himself out of trouble long.&nbsp; The
      royal shuttlecock being three-and-twenty, the battledores were very
      anxious to get him married.&nbsp; The Duke of Gloucester wanted him to
      marry a daughter of the Count of Armagnac; but, the Cardinal and the Earl
      of Suffolk were all for <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, the daughter
      of the King of Sicily, who they knew was a resolute, ambitious woman and
      would govern the King as she chose.&nbsp; To make friends with this lady,
      the Earl of Suffolk, who went over to arrange the match, consented to
      accept her for the King&rsquo;s wife without any fortune, and even to give
      up the two most valuable possessions England then had in France.&nbsp; So,
      the marriage was arranged, on terms very advantageous to the lady; and
      Lord Suffolk brought her to England, and she was married at Westminster.&nbsp;
      On what pretence this queen and her party charged the Duke of Gloucester
      with high treason within a couple of years, it is impossible to make out,
      the matter is so confused; but, they pretended that the King&rsquo;s life
      was in danger, and they took the duke prisoner.&nbsp; A fortnight
      afterwards, he was found dead in bed (they said), and his body was shown
      to the people, and Lord Suffolk came in for the best part of his estates.&nbsp;
      You know by this time how strangely liable state prisoners were to sudden
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Cardinal Beaufort had any hand in this matter, it did him no good, for
      he died within six weeks; thinking it very hard and curious&mdash;at
      eighty years old!&mdash;that he could not live to be Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the time when England had completed her loss of all her great
      French conquests.&nbsp; The people charged the loss principally upon the
      Earl of Suffolk, now a duke, who had made those easy terms about the Royal
      Marriage, and who, they believed, had even been bought by France.&nbsp; So
      he was impeached as a traitor, on a great number of charges, but chiefly
      on accusations of having aided the French King, and of designing to make
      his own son King of England.&nbsp; The Commons and the people being
      violent against him, the King was made (by his friends) to interpose to
      save him, by banishing him for five years, and proroguing the Parliament.&nbsp;
      The duke had much ado to escape from a London mob, two thousand strong,
      who lay in wait for him in St. Giles&rsquo;s fields; but, he got down to
      his own estates in Suffolk, and sailed away from Ipswich.&nbsp; Sailing
      across the Channel, he sent into Calais to know if he might land there;
      but, they kept his boat and men in the harbour, until an English ship,
      carrying a hundred and fifty men and called the Nicholas of the Tower,
      came alongside his little vessel, and ordered him on board.&nbsp; &lsquo;Welcome,
      traitor, as men say,&rsquo; was the captain&rsquo;s grim and not very
      respectful salutation.&nbsp; He was kept on board, a prisoner, for
      eight-and-forty hours, and then a small boat appeared rowing toward the
      ship.&nbsp; As this boat came nearer, it was seen to have in it a block, a
      rusty sword, and an executioner in a black mask.&nbsp; The duke was handed
      down into it, and there his head was cut off with six strokes of the rusty
      sword.&nbsp; Then, the little boat rowed away to Dover beach, where the
      body was cast out, and left until the duchess claimed it.&nbsp; By whom,
      high in authority, this murder was committed, has never appeared.&nbsp; No
      one was ever punished for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There now arose in Kent an Irishman, who gave himself the name of
      Mortimer, but whose real name was <span class="smcap">Jack Cade</span>.&nbsp;
      Jack, in imitation of Wat Tyler, though he was a very different and
      inferior sort of man, addressed the Kentish men upon their wrongs,
      occasioned by the bad government of England, among so many battledores and
      such a poor shuttlecock; and the Kentish men rose up to the number of
      twenty thousand.&nbsp; Their place of assembly was Blackheath, where,
      headed by Jack, they put forth two papers, which they called &lsquo;The
      Complaint of the Commons of Kent,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Requests of the
      Captain of the Great Assembly in Kent.&rsquo;&nbsp; They then retired to
      Sevenoaks.&nbsp; The royal army coming up with them here, they beat it and
      killed their general.&nbsp; Then, Jack dressed himself in the dead general&rsquo;s
      armour, and led his men to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack passed into the City from Southwark, over the bridge, and entered it
      in triumph, giving the strictest orders to his men not to plunder.&nbsp;
      Having made a show of his forces there, while the citizens looked on
      quietly, he went back into Southwark in good order, and passed the night.&nbsp;
      Next day, he came back again, having got hold in the meantime of Lord Say,
      an unpopular nobleman.&nbsp; Says Jack to the Lord Mayor and judges:
      &lsquo;Will you be so good as to make a tribunal in Guildhall, and try me
      this nobleman?&rsquo;&nbsp; The court being hastily made, he was found
      guilty, and Jack and his men cut his head off on Cornhill.&nbsp; They also
      cut off the head of his son-in-law, and then went back in good order to
      Southwark again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, although the citizens could bear the beheading of an unpopular lord,
      they could not bear to have their houses pillaged.&nbsp; And it did so
      happen that Jack, after dinner&mdash;perhaps he had drunk a little too
      much&mdash;began to plunder the house where he lodged; upon which, of
      course, his men began to imitate him.&nbsp; Wherefore, the Londoners took
      counsel with Lord Scales, who had a thousand soldiers in the Tower; and
      defended London Bridge, and kept Jack and his people out.&nbsp; This
      advantage gained, it was resolved by divers great men to divide Jack&rsquo;s
      army in the old way, by making a great many promises on behalf of the
      state, that were never intended to be performed.&nbsp; This <i>did</i>
      divide them; some of Jack&rsquo;s men saying that they ought to take the
      conditions which were offered, and others saying that they ought not, for
      they were only a snare; some going home at once; others staying where they
      were; and all doubting and quarrelling among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, who was in two minds about fighting or accepting a pardon, and who
      indeed did both, saw at last that there was nothing to expect from his
      men, and that it was very likely some of them would deliver him up and get
      a reward of a thousand marks, which was offered for his apprehension.&nbsp;
      So, after they had travelled and quarrelled all the way from Southwark to
      Blackheath, and from Blackheath to Rochester, he mounted a good horse and
      galloped away into Sussex.&nbsp; But, there galloped after him, on a
      better horse, one Alexander Iden, who came up with him, had a hard fight
      with him, and killed him.&nbsp; Jack&rsquo;s head was set aloft on London
      Bridge, with the face looking towards Blackheath, where he had raised his
      flag; and Alexander Iden got the thousand marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is supposed by some, that the Duke of York, who had been removed from a
      high post abroad through the Queen&rsquo;s influence, and sent out of the
      way, to govern Ireland, was at the bottom of this rising of Jack and his
      men, because he wanted to trouble the government.&nbsp; He claimed (though
      not yet publicly) to have a better right to the throne than Henry of
      Lancaster, as one of the family of the Earl of March, whom Henry the
      Fourth had set aside.&nbsp; Touching this claim, which, being through
      female relationship, was not according to the usual descent, it is enough
      to say that Henry the Fourth was the free choice of the people and the
      Parliament, and that his family had now reigned undisputed for sixty
      years.&nbsp; The memory of Henry the Fifth was so famous, and the English
      people loved it so much, that the Duke of York&rsquo;s claim would,
      perhaps, never have been thought of (it would have been so hopeless) but
      for the unfortunate circumstance of the present King&rsquo;s being by this
      time quite an idiot, and the country very ill governed.&nbsp; These two
      circumstances gave the Duke of York a power he could not otherwise have
      had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the Duke knew anything of Jack Cade, or not, he came over from
      Ireland while Jack&rsquo;s head was on London Bridge; being secretly
      advised that the Queen was setting up his enemy, the Duke of Somerset,
      against him.&nbsp; He went to Westminster, at the head of four thousand
      men, and on his knees before the King, represented to him the bad state of
      the country, and petitioned him to summon a Parliament to consider it.&nbsp;
      This the King promised.&nbsp; When the Parliament was summoned, the Duke
      of York accused the Duke of Somerset, and the Duke of Somerset accused the
      Duke of York; and, both in and out of Parliament, the followers of each
      party were full of violence and hatred towards the other.&nbsp; At length
      the Duke of York put himself at the head of a large force of his tenants,
      and, in arms, demanded the reformation of the Government.&nbsp; Being shut
      out of London, he encamped at Dartford, and the royal army encamped at
      Blackheath.&nbsp; According as either side triumphed, the Duke of York was
      arrested, or the Duke of Somerset was arrested.&nbsp; The trouble ended,
      for the moment, in the Duke of York renewing his oath of allegiance, and
      going in peace to one of his own castles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a year afterwards the Queen gave birth to a son, who was very ill
      received by the people, and not believed to be the son of the King.&nbsp;
      It shows the Duke of York to have been a moderate man, unwilling to
      involve England in new troubles, that he did not take advantage of the
      general discontent at this time, but really acted for the public good.&nbsp;
      He was made a member of the cabinet, and the King being now so much worse
      that he could not be carried about and shown to the people with any
      decency, the duke was made Lord Protector of the kingdom, until the King
      should recover, or the Prince should come of age.&nbsp; At the same time
      the Duke of Somerset was committed to the Tower.&nbsp; So, now the Duke of
      Somerset was down, and the Duke of York was up.&nbsp; By the end of the
      year, however, the King recovered his memory and some spark of sense; upon
      which the Queen used her power&mdash;which recovered with him&mdash;to get
      the Protector disgraced, and her favourite released.&nbsp; So now the Duke
      of York was down, and the Duke of Somerset was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ducal ups and downs gradually separated the whole nation into the
      two parties of York and Lancaster, and led to those terrible civil wars
      long known as the Wars of the Red and White Roses, because the red rose
      was the badge of the House of Lancaster, and the white rose was the badge
      of the House of York.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of York, joined by some other powerful noblemen of the White Rose
      party, and leading a small army, met the King with another small army at
      St. Alban&rsquo;s, and demanded that the Duke of Somerset should be given
      up.&nbsp; The poor King, being made to say in answer that he would sooner
      die, was instantly attacked.&nbsp; The Duke of Somerset was killed, and
      the King himself was wounded in the neck, and took refuge in the house of
      a poor tanner.&nbsp; Whereupon, the Duke of York went to him, led him with
      great submission to the Abbey, and said he was very sorry for what had
      happened.&nbsp; Having now the King in his possession, he got a Parliament
      summoned and himself once more made Protector, but, only for a few months;
      for, on the King getting a little better again, the Queen and her party
      got him into their possession, and disgraced the Duke once more.&nbsp; So,
      now the Duke of York was down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the best men in power, seeing the danger of these constant
      changes, tried even then to prevent the Red and the White Rose Wars.&nbsp;
      They brought about a great council in London between the two parties.&nbsp;
      The White Roses assembled in Blackfriars, the Red Roses in Whitefriars;
      and some good priests communicated between them, and made the proceedings
      known at evening to the King and the judges.&nbsp; They ended in a
      peaceful agreement that there should be no more quarrelling; and there was
      a great royal procession to St. Paul&rsquo;s, in which the Queen walked
      arm-in-arm with her old enemy, the Duke of York, to show the people how
      comfortable they all were.&nbsp; This state of peace lasted half a year,
      when a dispute between the Earl of Warwick (one of the Duke&rsquo;s
      powerful friends) and some of the King&rsquo;s servants at Court, led to
      an attack upon that Earl&mdash;who was a White Rose&mdash;and to a sudden
      breaking out of all old animosities.&nbsp; So, here were greater ups and
      downs than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were even greater ups and downs than these, soon after.&nbsp; After
      various battles, the Duke of York fled to Ireland, and his son the Earl of
      March to Calais, with their friends the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick;
      and a Parliament was held declaring them all traitors.&nbsp; Little the
      worse for this, the Earl of Warwick presently came back, landed in Kent,
      was joined by the Archbishop of Canterbury and other powerful noblemen and
      gentlemen, engaged the King&rsquo;s forces at Northampton, signally
      defeated them, and took the King himself prisoner, who was found in his
      tent.&nbsp; Warwick would have been glad, I dare say, to have taken the
      Queen and Prince too, but they escaped into Wales and thence into
      Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was carried by the victorious force straight to London, and made
      to call a new Parliament, which immediately declared that the Duke of York
      and those other noblemen were not traitors, but excellent subjects.&nbsp;
      Then, back comes the Duke from Ireland at the head of five hundred
      horsemen, rides from London to Westminster, and enters the House of Lords.&nbsp;
      There, he laid his hand upon the cloth of gold which covered the empty
      throne, as if he had half a mind to sit down in it&mdash;but he did not.&nbsp;
      On the Archbishop of Canterbury, asking him if he would visit the King,
      who was in his palace close by, he replied, &lsquo;I know no one in this
      country, my lord, who ought not to visit <i>me</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; None of
      the lords present spoke a single word; so, the duke went out as he had
      come in, established himself royally in the King&rsquo;s palace, and, six
      days afterwards, sent in to the Lords a formal statement of his claim to
      the throne.&nbsp; The lords went to the King on this momentous subject,
      and after a great deal of discussion, in which the judges and the other
      law officers were afraid to give an opinion on either side, the question
      was compromised.&nbsp; It was agreed that the present King should retain
      the crown for his life, and that it should then pass to the Duke of York
      and his heirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, the resolute Queen, determined on asserting her son&rsquo;s right,
      would hear of no such thing.&nbsp; She came from Scotland to the north of
      England, where several powerful lords armed in her cause.&nbsp; The Duke
      of York, for his part, set off with some five thousand men, a little time
      before Christmas Day, one thousand four hundred and sixty, to give her
      battle.&nbsp; He lodged at Sandal Castle, near Wakefield, and the Red
      Roses defied him to come out on Wakefield Green, and fight them then and
      there.&nbsp; His generals said, he had best wait until his gallant son,
      the Earl of March, came up with his power; but, he was determined to
      accept the challenge.&nbsp; He did so, in an evil hour.&nbsp; He was hotly
      pressed on all sides, two thousand of his men lay dead on Wakefield Green,
      and he himself was taken prisoner.&nbsp; They set him down in mock state
      on an ant-hill, and twisted grass about his head, and pretended to pay
      court to him on their knees, saying, &lsquo;O King, without a kingdom, and
      Prince without a people, we hope your gracious Majesty is very well and
      happy!&rsquo;&nbsp; They did worse than this; they cut his head off, and
      handed it on a pole to the Queen, who laughed with delight when she saw it
      (you recollect their walking so religiously and comfortably to St. Paul&rsquo;s!),
      and had it fixed, with a paper crown upon its head, on the walls of York.&nbsp;
      The Earl of Salisbury lost his head, too; and the Duke of York&rsquo;s
      second son, a handsome boy who was flying with his tutor over Wakefield
      Bridge, was stabbed in the heart by a murderous, lord&mdash;Lord Clifford
      by name&mdash;whose father had been killed by the White Roses in the fight
      at St. Alban&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There was awful sacrifice of life in this
      battle, for no quarter was given, and the Queen was wild for revenge.&nbsp;
      When men unnaturally fight against their own countrymen, they are always
      observed to be more unnaturally cruel and filled with rage than they are
      against any other enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Lord Clifford had stabbed the second son of the Duke of York&mdash;not
      the first.&nbsp; The eldest son, Edward Earl of March, was at Gloucester;
      and, vowing vengeance for the death of his father, his brother, and their
      faithful friends, he began to march against the Queen.&nbsp; He had to
      turn and fight a great body of Welsh and Irish first, who worried his
      advance.&nbsp; These he defeated in a great fight at Mortimer&rsquo;s
      Cross, near Hereford, where he beheaded a number of the Red Roses taken in
      battle, in retaliation for the beheading of the White Roses at Wakefield.&nbsp;
      The Queen had the next turn of beheading.&nbsp; Having moved towards
      London, and falling in, between St. Alban&rsquo;s and Barnet, with the
      Earl of Warwick and the Duke of Norfolk, White Roses both, who were there
      with an army to oppose her, and had got the King with them; she defeated
      them with great loss, and struck off the heads of two prisoners of note,
      who were in the King&rsquo;s tent with him, and to whom the King had
      promised his protection.&nbsp; Her triumph, however, was very short.&nbsp;
      She had no treasure, and her army subsisted by plunder.&nbsp; This caused
      them to be hated and dreaded by the people, and particularly by the London
      people, who were wealthy.&nbsp; As soon as the Londoners heard that
      Edward, Earl of March, united with the Earl of Warwick, was advancing
      towards the city, they refused to send the Queen supplies, and made a
      great rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen and her men retreated with all speed, and Edward and Warwick
      came on, greeted with loud acclamations on every side.&nbsp; The courage,
      beauty, and virtues of young Edward could not be sufficiently praised by
      the whole people.&nbsp; He rode into London like a conqueror, and met with
      an enthusiastic welcome.&nbsp; A few days afterwards, Lord Falconbridge
      and the Bishop of Exeter assembled the citizens in St. John&rsquo;s Field,
      Clerkenwell, and asked them if they would have Henry of Lancaster for
      their King?&nbsp; To this they all roared, &lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;King Edward!&nbsp; King Edward!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, said those
      noblemen, would they love and serve young Edward?&nbsp; To this they all
      cried, &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; and threw up their caps and clapped their
      hands, and cheered tremendously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, it was declared that by joining the Queen and not protecting
      those two prisoners of note, Henry of Lancaster had forfeited the crown;
      and Edward of York was proclaimed King.&nbsp; He made a great speech to
      the applauding people at Westminster, and sat down as sovereign of England
      on that throne, on the golden covering of which his father&mdash;worthy of
      a better fate than the bloody axe which cut the thread of so many lives in
      England, through so many years&mdash;had laid his hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FOURTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      King Edward the Fourth was not quite twenty-one years of age when he took
      that unquiet seat upon the throne of England.&nbsp; The Lancaster party,
      the Red Roses, were then assembling in great numbers near York, and it was
      necessary to give them battle instantly.&nbsp; But, the stout Earl of
      Warwick leading for the young King, and the young King himself closely
      following him, and the English people crowding round the Royal standard,
      the White and the Red Roses met, on a wild March day when the snow was
      falling heavily, at Towton; and there such a furious battle raged between
      them, that the total loss amounted to forty thousand men&mdash;all
      Englishmen, fighting, upon English ground, against one another.&nbsp; The
      young King gained the day, took down the heads of his father and brother
      from the walls of York, and put up the heads of some of the most famous
      noblemen engaged in the battle on the other side.&nbsp; Then, he went to
      London and was crowned with great splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new Parliament met.&nbsp; No fewer than one hundred and fifty of the
      principal noblemen and gentlemen on the Lancaster side were declared
      traitors, and the King&mdash;who had very little humanity, though he was
      handsome in person and agreeable in manners&mdash;resolved to do all he
      could, to pluck up the Red Rose root and branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Margaret, however, was still active for her young son.&nbsp; She
      obtained help from Scotland and from Normandy, and took several important
      English castles.&nbsp; But, Warwick soon retook them; the Queen lost all
      her treasure on board ship in a great storm; and both she and her son
      suffered great misfortunes.&nbsp; Once, in the winter weather, as they
      were riding through a forest, they were attacked and plundered by a party
      of robbers; and, when they had escaped from these men and were passing
      alone and on foot through a thick dark part of the wood, they came, all at
      once, upon another robber.&nbsp; So the Queen, with a stout heart, took
      the little Prince by the hand, and going straight up to that robber, said
      to him, &lsquo;My friend, this is the young son of your lawful King!&nbsp;
      I confide him to your care.&rsquo;&nbsp; The robber was surprised, but
      took the boy in his arms, and faithfully restored him and his mother to
      their friends.&nbsp; In the end, the Queen&rsquo;s soldiers being beaten
      and dispersed, she went abroad again, and kept quiet for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, all this time, the deposed King Henry was concealed by a Welsh
      knight, who kept him close in his castle.&nbsp; But, next year, the
      Lancaster party recovering their spirits, raised a large body of men, and
      called him out of his retirement, to put him at their head.&nbsp; They
      were joined by some powerful noblemen who had sworn fidelity to the new
      King, but who were ready, as usual, to break their oaths, whenever they
      thought there was anything to be got by it.&nbsp; One of the worst things
      in the history of the war of the Red and White Roses, is the ease with
      which these noblemen, who should have set an example of honour to the
      people, left either side as they took slight offence, or were disappointed
      in their greedy expectations, and joined the other.&nbsp; Well! Warwick&rsquo;s
      brother soon beat the Lancastrians, and the false noblemen, being taken,
      were beheaded without a moment&rsquo;s loss of time.&nbsp; The deposed
      King had a narrow escape; three of his servants were taken, and one of
      them bore his cap of estate, which was set with pearls and embroidered
      with two golden crowns.&nbsp; However, the head to which the cap belonged,
      got safely into Lancashire, and lay pretty quietly there (the people in
      the secret being very true) for more than a year.&nbsp; At length, an old
      monk gave such intelligence as led to Henry&rsquo;s being taken while he
      was sitting at dinner in a place called Waddington Hall.&nbsp; He was
      immediately sent to London, and met at Islington by the Earl of Warwick,
      by whose directions he was put upon a horse, with his legs tied under it,
      and paraded three times round the pillory.&nbsp; Then, he was carried off
      to the Tower, where they treated him well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The White Rose being so triumphant, the young King abandoned himself
      entirely to pleasure, and led a jovial life.&nbsp; But, thorns were
      springing up under his bed of roses, as he soon found out.&nbsp; For,
      having been privately married to <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Woodville</span>,
      a young widow lady, very beautiful and very captivating; and at last
      resolving to make his secret known, and to declare her his Queen; he gave
      some offence to the Earl of Warwick, who was usually called the
      King-Maker, because of his power and influence, and because of his having
      lent such great help to placing Edward on the throne.&nbsp; This offence
      was not lessened by the jealousy with which the Nevil family (the Earl of
      Warwick&rsquo;s) regarded the promotion of the Woodville family.&nbsp;
      For, the young Queen was so bent on providing for her relations, that she
      made her father an earl and a great officer of state; married her five
      sisters to young noblemen of the highest rank; and provided for her
      younger brother, a young man of twenty, by marrying him to an immensely
      rich old duchess of eighty.&nbsp; The Earl of Warwick took all this pretty
      graciously for a man of his proud temper, until the question arose to whom
      the King&rsquo;s sister, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, should be
      married.&nbsp; The Earl of Warwick said, &lsquo;To one of the French King&rsquo;s
      sons,&rsquo; and was allowed to go over to the French King to make
      friendly proposals for that purpose, and to hold all manner of friendly
      interviews with him.&nbsp; But, while he was so engaged, the Woodville
      party married the young lady to the Duke of Burgundy!&nbsp; Upon this he
      came back in great rage and scorn, and shut himself up discontented, in
      his Castle of Middleham.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reconciliation, though not a very sincere one, was patched up between
      the Earl of Warwick and the King, and lasted until the Earl married his
      daughter, against the King&rsquo;s wishes, to the Duke of Clarence.&nbsp;
      While the marriage was being celebrated at Calais, the people in the north
      of England, where the influence of the Nevil family was strongest, broke
      out into rebellion; their complaint was, that England was oppressed and
      plundered by the Woodville family, whom they demanded to have removed from
      power.&nbsp; As they were joined by great numbers of people, and as they
      openly declared that they were supported by the Earl of Warwick, the King
      did not know what to do.&nbsp; At last, as he wrote to the earl beseeching
      his aid, he and his new son-in-law came over to England, and began to
      arrange the business by shutting the King up in Middleham Castle in the
      safe keeping of the Archbishop of York; so England was not only in the
      strange position of having two kings at once, but they were both prisoners
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as yet, however, the King-Maker was so far true to the King, that he
      dispersed a new rising of the Lancastrians, took their leader prisoner,
      and brought him to the King, who ordered him to be immediately executed.&nbsp;
      He presently allowed the King to return to London, and there innumerable
      pledges of forgiveness and friendship were exchanged between them, and
      between the Nevils and the Woodvilles; the King&rsquo;s eldest daughter
      was promised in marriage to the heir of the Nevil family; and more
      friendly oaths were sworn, and more friendly promises made, than this book
      would hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lasted about three months.&nbsp; At the end of that time, the
      Archbishop of York made a feast for the King, the Earl of Warwick, and the
      Duke of Clarence, at his house, the Moor, in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; The King
      was washing his hands before supper, when some one whispered him that a
      body of a hundred men were lying in ambush outside the house.&nbsp;
      Whether this were true or untrue, the King took fright, mounted his horse,
      and rode through the dark night to Windsor Castle.&nbsp; Another
      reconciliation was patched up between him and the King-Maker, but it was a
      short one, and it was the last.&nbsp; A new rising took place in
      Lincolnshire, and the King marched to repress it.&nbsp; Having done so, he
      proclaimed that both the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of Clarence were
      traitors, who had secretly assisted it, and who had been prepared publicly
      to join it on the following day.&nbsp; In these dangerous circumstances
      they both took ship and sailed away to the French court.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here a meeting took place between the Earl of Warwick and his old
      enemy, the Dowager Queen Margaret, through whom his father had had his
      head struck off, and to whom he had been a bitter foe.&nbsp; But, now,
      when he said that he had done with the ungrateful and perfidious Edward of
      York, and that henceforth he devoted himself to the restoration of the
      House of Lancaster, either in the person of her husband or of her little
      son, she embraced him as if he had ever been her dearest friend.&nbsp; She
      did more than that; she married her son to his second daughter, the Lady
      Anne.&nbsp; However agreeable this marriage was to the new friends, it was
      very disagreeable to the Duke of Clarence, who perceived that his
      father-in-law, the King-Maker, would never make <i>him</i> King, now.&nbsp;
      So, being but a weak-minded young traitor, possessed of very little worth
      or sense, he readily listened to an artful court lady sent over for the
      purpose, and promised to turn traitor once more, and go over to his
      brother, King Edward, when a fitting opportunity should come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Warwick, knowing nothing of this, soon redeemed his promise to
      the Dowager Queen Margaret, by invading England and landing at Plymouth,
      where he instantly proclaimed King Henry, and summoned all Englishmen
      between the ages of sixteen and sixty, to join his banner.&nbsp; Then,
      with his army increasing as he marched along, he went northward, and came
      so near King Edward, who was in that part of the country, that Edward had
      to ride hard for it to the coast of Norfolk, and thence to get away in
      such ships as he could find, to Holland.&nbsp; Thereupon, the triumphant
      King-Maker and his false son-in-law, the Duke of Clarence, went to London,
      took the old King out of the Tower, and walked him in a great procession
      to Saint Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral with the crown upon his head.&nbsp; This
      did not improve the temper of the Duke of Clarence, who saw himself
      farther off from being King than ever; but he kept his secret, and said
      nothing.&nbsp; The Nevil family were restored to all their honours and
      glories, and the Woodvilles and the rest were disgraced.&nbsp; The
      King-Maker, less sanguinary than the King, shed no blood except that of
      the Earl of Worcester, who had been so cruel to the people as to have
      gained the title of the Butcher.&nbsp; Him they caught hidden in a tree,
      and him they tried and executed.&nbsp; No other death stained the
      King-Maker&rsquo;s triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      To dispute this triumph, back came King Edward again, next year, landing
      at Ravenspur, coming on to York, causing all his men to cry &lsquo;Long
      live King Henry!&rsquo; and swearing on the altar, without a blush, that
      he came to lay no claim to the crown.&nbsp; Now was the time for the Duke
      of Clarence, who ordered his men to assume the White Rose, and declare for
      his brother.&nbsp; The Marquis of Montague, though the Earl of Warwick&rsquo;s
      brother, also declining to fight against King Edward, he went on
      successfully to London, where the Archbishop of York let him into the
      City, and where the people made great demonstrations in his favour.&nbsp;
      For this they had four reasons.&nbsp; Firstly, there were great numbers of
      the King&rsquo;s adherents hiding in the City and ready to break out;
      secondly, the King owed them a great deal of money, which they could never
      hope to get if he were unsuccessful; thirdly, there was a young prince to
      inherit the crown; and fourthly, the King was gay and handsome, and more
      popular than a better man might have been with the City ladies.&nbsp;
      After a stay of only two days with these worthy supporters, the King
      marched out to Barnet Common, to give the Earl of Warwick battle.&nbsp;
      And now it was to be seen, for the last time, whether the King or the
      King-Maker was to carry the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the battle was yet pending, the fainthearted Duke of Clarence began
      to repent, and sent over secret messages to his father-in-law, offering
      his services in mediation with the King.&nbsp; But, the Earl of Warwick
      disdainfully rejected them, and replied that Clarence was false and
      perjured, and that he would settle the quarrel by the sword.&nbsp; The
      battle began at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning and lasted until ten,
      and during the greater part of the time it was fought in a thick mist&mdash;absurdly
      supposed to be raised by a magician.&nbsp; The loss of life was very
      great, for the hatred was strong on both sides.&nbsp; The King-Maker was
      defeated, and the King triumphed.&nbsp; Both the Earl of Warwick and his
      brother were slain, and their bodies lay in St. Paul&rsquo;s, for some
      days, as a spectacle to the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s spirit was not broken even by this great blow.&nbsp;
      Within five days she was in arms again, and raised her standard in Bath,
      whence she set off with her army, to try and join Lord Pembroke, who had a
      force in Wales.&nbsp; But, the King, coming up with her outside the town
      of Tewkesbury, and ordering his brother, the <span class="smcap">Duke of
      Gloucester</span>, who was a brave soldier, to attack her men, she
      sustained an entire defeat, and was taken prisoner, together with her son,
      now only eighteen years of age.&nbsp; The conduct of the King to this poor
      youth was worthy of his cruel character.&nbsp; He ordered him to be led
      into his tent.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;brought <i>you</i>
      to England?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I came to England,&rsquo; replied the
      prisoner, with a spirit which a man of spirit might have admired in a
      captive, &lsquo;to recover my father&rsquo;s kingdom, which descended to
      him as his right, and from him descends to me, as mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
      King, drawing off his iron gauntlet, struck him with it in the face; and
      the Duke of Clarence and some other lords, who were there, drew their
      noble swords, and killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother survived him, a prisoner, for five years; after her ransom by
      the King of France, she survived for six years more.&nbsp; Within three
      weeks of this murder, Henry died one of those convenient sudden deaths
      which were so common in the Tower; in plainer words, he was murdered by
      the King&rsquo;s order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having no particular excitement on his hands after this great defeat of
      the Lancaster party, and being perhaps desirous to get rid of some of his
      fat (for he was now getting too corpulent to be handsome), the King
      thought of making war on France.&nbsp; As he wanted more money for this
      purpose than the Parliament could give him, though they were usually ready
      enough for war, he invented a new way of raising it, by sending for the
      principal citizens of London, and telling them, with a grave face, that he
      was very much in want of cash, and would take it very kind in them if they
      would lend him some.&nbsp; It being impossible for them safely to refuse,
      they complied, and the moneys thus forced from them were called&mdash;no
      doubt to the great amusement of the King and the Court&mdash;as if they
      were free gifts, &lsquo;Benevolences.&rsquo;&nbsp; What with grants from
      Parliament, and what with Benevolences, the King raised an army and passed
      over to Calais.&nbsp; As nobody wanted war, however, the French King made
      proposals of peace, which were accepted, and a truce was concluded for
      seven long years.&nbsp; The proceedings between the Kings of France and
      England on this occasion, were very friendly, very splendid, and very
      distrustful.&nbsp; They finished with a meeting between the two Kings, on
      a temporary bridge over the river Somme, where they embraced through two
      holes in a strong wooden grating like a lion&rsquo;s cage, and made
      several bows and fine speeches to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time, now, that the Duke of Clarence should be punished for his
      treacheries; and Fate had his punishment in store.&nbsp; He was, probably,
      not trusted by the King&mdash;for who could trust him who knew him!&mdash;and
      he had certainly a powerful opponent in his brother Richard, Duke of
      Gloucester, who, being avaricious and ambitious, wanted to marry that
      widowed daughter of the Earl of Warwick&rsquo;s who had been espoused to
      the deceased young Prince, at Calais.&nbsp; Clarence, who wanted all the
      family wealth for himself, secreted this lady, whom Richard found
      disguised as a servant in the City of London, and whom he married;
      arbitrators appointed by the King, then divided the property between the
      brothers.&nbsp; This led to ill-will and mistrust between them.&nbsp;
      Clarence&rsquo;s wife dying, and he wishing to make another marriage,
      which was obnoxious to the King, his ruin was hurried by that means, too.&nbsp;
      At first, the Court struck at his retainers and dependents, and accused
      some of them of magic and witchcraft, and similar nonsense.&nbsp;
      Successful against this small game, it then mounted to the Duke himself,
      who was impeached by his brother the King, in person, on a variety of such
      charges.&nbsp; He was found guilty, and sentenced to be publicly executed.&nbsp;
      He never was publicly executed, but he met his death somehow, in the
      Tower, and, no doubt, through some agency of the King or his brother
      Gloucester, or both.&nbsp; It was supposed at the time that he was told to
      choose the manner of his death, and that he chose to be drowned in a butt
      of Malmsey wine.&nbsp; I hope the story may be true, for it would have
      been a becoming death for such a miserable creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King survived him some five years.&nbsp; He died in the forty-second
      year of his life, and the twenty-third of his reign.&nbsp; He had a very
      good capacity and some good points, but he was selfish, careless, sensual,
      and cruel.&nbsp; He was a favourite with the people for his showy manners;
      and the people were a good example to him in the constancy of their
      attachment.&nbsp; He was penitent on his death-bed for his &lsquo;benevolences,&rsquo;
      and other extortions, and ordered restitution to be made to the people who
      had suffered from them.&nbsp; He also called about his bed the enriched
      members of the Woodville family, and the proud lords whose honours were of
      older date, and endeavoured to reconcile them, for the sake of the
      peaceful succession of his son and the tranquillity of England.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIFTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      The late King&rsquo;s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, called <span
      class="smcap">Edward</span> after him, was only thirteen years of age at
      his father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He was at Ludlow Castle with his uncle,
      the Earl of Rivers.&nbsp; The prince&rsquo;s brother, the Duke of York,
      only eleven years of age, was in London with his mother.&nbsp; The
      boldest, most crafty, and most dreaded nobleman in England at that time
      was their uncle <span class="smcap">Richard</span>, Duke of Gloucester,
      and everybody wondered how the two poor boys would fare with such an uncle
      for a friend or a foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, their mother, being exceedingly uneasy about this, was anxious
      that instructions should be sent to Lord Rivers to raise an army to escort
      the young King safely to London.&nbsp; But, Lord Hastings, who was of the
      Court party opposed to the Woodvilles, and who disliked the thought of
      giving them that power, argued against the proposal, and obliged the Queen
      to be satisfied with an escort of two thousand horse.&nbsp; The Duke of
      Gloucester did nothing, at first, to justify suspicion.&nbsp; He came from
      Scotland (where he was commanding an army) to York, and was there the
      first to swear allegiance to his nephew.&nbsp; He then wrote a condoling
      letter to the Queen-Mother, and set off to be present at the coronation in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the young King, journeying towards London too, with Lord Rivers and
      Lord Gray, came to Stony Stratford, as his uncle came to Northampton,
      about ten miles distant; and when those two lords heard that the Duke of
      Gloucester was so near, they proposed to the young King that they should
      go back and greet him in his name.&nbsp; The boy being very willing that
      they should do so, they rode off and were received with great
      friendliness, and asked by the Duke of Gloucester to stay and dine with
      him.&nbsp; In the evening, while they were merry together, up came the
      Duke of Buckingham with three hundred horsemen; and next morning the two
      lords and the two dukes, and the three hundred horsemen, rode away
      together to rejoin the King.&nbsp; Just as they were entering Stony
      Stratford, the Duke of Gloucester, checking his horse, turned suddenly on
      the two lords, charged them with alienating from him the affections of his
      sweet nephew, and caused them to be arrested by the three hundred horsemen
      and taken back.&nbsp; Then, he and the Duke of Buckingham went straight to
      the King (whom they had now in their power), to whom they made a show of
      kneeling down, and offering great love and submission; and then they
      ordered his attendants to disperse, and took him, alone with them, to
      Northampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards they conducted him to London, and lodged him in the
      Bishop&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp; But, he did not remain there long; for, the
      Duke of Buckingham with a tender face made a speech expressing how anxious
      he was for the Royal boy&rsquo;s safety, and how much safer he would be in
      the Tower until his coronation, than he could be anywhere else.&nbsp; So,
      to the Tower he was taken, very carefully, and the Duke of Gloucester was
      named Protector of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Gloucester had proceeded thus far with a very smooth countenance&mdash;and
      although he was a clever man, fair of speech, and not ill-looking, in
      spite of one of his shoulders being something higher than the other&mdash;and
      although he had come into the City riding bare-headed at the King&rsquo;s
      side, and looking very fond of him&mdash;he had made the King&rsquo;s
      mother more uneasy yet; and when the Royal boy was taken to the Tower, she
      became so alarmed that she took sanctuary in Westminster with her five
      daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did she do this without reason, for, the Duke of Gloucester, finding
      that the lords who were opposed to the Woodville family were faithful to
      the young King nevertheless, quickly resolved to strike a blow for
      himself.&nbsp; Accordingly, while those lords met in council at the Tower,
      he and those who were in his interest met in separate council at his own
      residence, Crosby Palace, in Bishopsgate Street.&nbsp; Being at last quite
      prepared, he one day appeared unexpectedly at the council in the Tower,
      and appeared to be very jocular and merry.&nbsp; He was particularly gay
      with the Bishop of Ely: praising the strawberries that grew in his garden
      on Holborn Hill, and asking him to have some gathered that he might eat
      them at dinner.&nbsp; The Bishop, quite proud of the honour, sent one of
      his men to fetch some; and the Duke, still very jocular and gay, went out;
      and the council all said what a very agreeable duke he was!&nbsp; In a
      little time, however, he came back quite altered&mdash;not at all jocular&mdash;frowning
      and fierce&mdash;and suddenly said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do those persons deserve who have compassed my destruction; I
      being the King&rsquo;s lawful, as well as natural, protector?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this strange question, Lord Hastings replied, that they deserved death,
      whosoever they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Duke, &lsquo;I tell you that they are that
      sorceress my brother&rsquo;s wife;&rsquo; meaning the Queen: &lsquo;and
      that other sorceress, Jane Shore.&nbsp; Who, by witchcraft, have withered
      my body, and caused my arm to shrink as I now show you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then pulled up his sleeve and showed them his arm, which was shrunken,
      it is true, but which had been so, as they all very well knew, from the
      hour of his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Shore, being then the lover of Lord Hastings, as she had formerly
      been of the late King, that lord knew that he himself was attacked.&nbsp;
      So, he said, in some confusion, &lsquo;Certainly, my Lord, if they have
      done this, they be worthy of punishment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If?&rsquo; said the Duke of Gloucester; &lsquo;do you talk to me of
      ifs?&nbsp; I tell you that they <i>have</i> so done, and I will make it
      good upon thy body, thou traitor!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, he struck the table a great blow with his fist.&nbsp; This was
      a signal to some of his people outside to cry &lsquo;Treason!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      They immediately did so, and there was a rush into the chamber of so many
      armed men that it was filled in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First,&rsquo; said the Duke of Gloucester to Lord Hastings, &lsquo;I
      arrest thee, traitor!&nbsp; And let him,&rsquo; he added to the armed men
      who took him, &lsquo;have a priest at once, for by St. Paul I will not
      dine until I have seen his head of!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Hastings was hurried to the green by the Tower chapel, and there
      beheaded on a log of wood that happened to be lying on the ground.&nbsp;
      Then, the Duke dined with a good appetite, and after dinner summoning the
      principal citizens to attend him, told them that Lord Hastings and the
      rest had designed to murder both himself and the Duke if Buckingham, who
      stood by his side, if he had not providentially discovered their design.&nbsp;
      He requested them to be so obliging as to inform their fellow-citizens of
      the truth of what he said, and issued a proclamation (prepared and neatly
      copied out beforehand) to the same effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same day that the Duke did these things in the Tower, Sir Richard
      Ratcliffe, the boldest and most undaunted of his men, went down to
      Pontefract; arrested Lord Rivers, Lord Gray, and two other gentlemen; and
      publicly executed them on the scaffold, without any trial, for having
      intended the Duke&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Three days afterwards the Duke, not
      to lose time, went down the river to Westminster in his barge, attended by
      divers bishops, lords, and soldiers, and demanded that the Queen should
      deliver her second son, the Duke of York, into his safe keeping.&nbsp; The
      Queen, being obliged to comply, resigned the child after she had wept over
      him; and Richard of Gloucester placed him with his brother in the Tower.&nbsp;
      Then, he seized Jane Shore, and, because she had been the lover of the
      late King, confiscated her property, and got her sentenced to do public
      penance in the streets by walking in a scanty dress, with bare feet, and
      carrying a lighted candle, to St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, through the most
      crowded part of the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now all things ready for his own advancement, he caused a friar to
      preach a sermon at the cross which stood in front of St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Cathedral, in which he dwelt upon the profligate manners of the late King,
      and upon the late shame of Jane Shore, and hinted that the princes were
      not his children.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whereas, good people,&rsquo; said the
      friar, whose name was <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>, &lsquo;my Lord the
      Protector, the noble Duke of Gloucester, that sweet prince, the pattern of
      all the noblest virtues, is the perfect image and express likeness of his
      father.&rsquo;&nbsp; There had been a little plot between the Duke and the
      friar, that the Duke should appear in the crowd at this moment, when it
      was expected that the people would cry &lsquo;Long live King Richard!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      But, either through the friar saying the words too soon, or through the
      Duke&rsquo;s coming too late, the Duke and the words did not come
      together, and the people only laughed, and the friar sneaked off ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Buckingham was a better hand at such business than the friar,
      so he went to the Guildhall the next day, and addressed the citizens in
      the Lord Protector&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; A few dirty men, who had been
      hired and stationed there for the purpose, crying when he had done,
      &lsquo;God save King Richard!&rsquo; he made them a great bow, and thanked
      them with all his heart.&nbsp; Next day, to make an end of it, he went
      with the mayor and some lords and citizens to Bayard Castle, by the river,
      where Richard then was, and read an address, humbly entreating him to
      accept the Crown of England.&nbsp; Richard, who looked down upon them out
      of a window and pretended to be in great uneasiness and alarm, assured
      them there was nothing he desired less, and that his deep affection for
      his nephews forbade him to think of it.&nbsp; To this the Duke of
      Buckingham replied, with pretended warmth, that the free people of England
      would never submit to his nephew&rsquo;s rule, and that if Richard, who
      was the lawful heir, refused the Crown, why then they must find some one
      else to wear it.&nbsp; The Duke of Gloucester returned, that since he used
      that strong language, it became his painful duty to think no more of
      himself, and to accept the Crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that, the people cheered and dispersed; and the Duke of Gloucester
      and the Duke of Buckingham passed a pleasant evening, talking over the
      play they had just acted with so much success, and every word of which
      they had prepared together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE THIRD
    </h2>
    <p>
      King Richard the Third was up betimes in the morning, and went to
      Westminster Hall.&nbsp; In the Hall was a marble seat, upon which he sat
      himself down between two great noblemen, and told the people that he began
      the new reign in that place, because the first duty of a sovereign was to
      administer the laws equally to all, and to maintain justice.&nbsp; He then
      mounted his horse and rode back to the City, where he was received by the
      clergy and the crowd as if he really had a right to the throne, and really
      were a just man.&nbsp; The clergy and the crowd must have been rather
      ashamed of themselves in secret, I think, for being such poor-spirited
      knaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new King and his Queen were soon crowned with a great deal of show and
      noise, which the people liked very much; and then the King set forth on a
      royal progress through his dominions.&nbsp; He was crowned a second time
      at York, in order that the people might have show and noise enough; and
      wherever he went was received with shouts of rejoicing&mdash;from a good
      many people of strong lungs, who were paid to strain their throats in
      crying, &lsquo;God save King Richard!&rsquo;&nbsp; The plan was so
      successful that I am told it has been imitated since, by other usurpers,
      in other progresses through other dominions.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was on this journey, King Richard stayed a week at Warwick.&nbsp;
      And from Warwick he sent instructions home for one of the wickedest
      murders that ever was done&mdash;the murder of the two young princes, his
      nephews, who were shut up in the Tower of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert Brackenbury was at that time Governor of the Tower.&nbsp; To
      him, by the hands of a messenger named <span class="smcap">John Green</span>,
      did King Richard send a letter, ordering him by some means to put the two
      young princes to death.&nbsp; But Sir Robert&mdash;I hope because he had
      children of his own, and loved them&mdash;sent John Green back again,
      riding and spurring along the dusty roads, with the answer that he could
      not do so horrible a piece of work.&nbsp; The King, having frowningly
      considered a little, called to him <span class="smcap">Sir James Tyrrel</span>,
      his master of the horse, and to him gave authority to take command of the
      Tower, whenever he would, for twenty-four hours, and to keep all the keys
      of the Tower during that space of time.&nbsp; Tyrrel, well knowing what
      was wanted, looked about him for two hardened ruffians, and chose <span
      class="smcap">John Dighton</span>, one of his own grooms, and <span
      class="smcap">Miles Forest</span>, who was a murderer by trade.&nbsp;
      Having secured these two assistants, he went, upon a day in August, to the
      Tower, showed his authority from the King, took the command for
      four-and-twenty hours, and obtained possession of the keys.&nbsp; And when
      the black night came he went creeping, creeping, like a guilty villain as
      he was, up the dark, stone winding stairs, and along the dark stone
      passages, until he came to the door of the room where the two young
      princes, having said their prayers, lay fast asleep, clasped in each other&rsquo;s
      arms.&nbsp; And while he watched and listened at the door, he sent in
      those evil demons, John Dighton and Miles Forest, who smothered the two
      princes with the bed and pillows, and carried their bodies down the
      stairs, and buried them under a great heap of stones at the staircase
      foot.&nbsp; And when the day came, he gave up the command of the Tower,
      and restored the keys, and hurried away without once looking behind him;
      and Sir Robert Brackenbury went with fear and sadness to the princes&rsquo;
      room, and found the princes gone for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know, through all this history, how true it is that traitors are never
      true, and you will not be surprised to learn that the Duke of Buckingham
      soon turned against King Richard, and joined a great conspiracy that was
      formed to dethrone him, and to place the crown upon its rightful owner&rsquo;s
      head.&nbsp; Richard had meant to keep the murder secret; but when he heard
      through his spies that this conspiracy existed, and that many lords and
      gentlemen drank in secret to the healths of the two young princes in the
      Tower, he made it known that they were dead.&nbsp; The conspirators,
      though thwarted for a moment, soon resolved to set up for the crown
      against the murderous Richard, <span class="smcap">Henry</span> Earl of
      Richmond, grandson of Catherine: that widow of Henry the Fifth who married
      Owen Tudor.&nbsp; And as Henry was of the house of Lancaster, they
      proposed that he should marry the Princess Elizabeth, the eldest daughter
      of the late King, now the heiress of the house of York, and thus by
      uniting the rival families put an end to the fatal wars of the Red and
      White Roses.&nbsp; All being settled, a time was appointed for Henry to
      come over from Brittany, and for a great rising against Richard to take
      place in several parts of England at the same hour.&nbsp; On a certain
      day, therefore, in October, the revolt took place; but unsuccessfully.&nbsp;
      Richard was prepared, Henry was driven back at sea by a storm, his
      followers in England were dispersed, and the Duke of Buckingham was taken,
      and at once beheaded in the market-place at Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of his success was a good time, Richard thought, for summoning a
      Parliament and getting some money.&nbsp; So, a Parliament was called, and
      it flattered and fawned upon him as much as he could possibly desire, and
      declared him to be the rightful King of England, and his only son Edward,
      then eleven years of age, the next heir to the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard knew full well that, let the Parliament say what it would, the
      Princess Elizabeth was remembered by people as the heiress of the house of
      York; and having accurate information besides, of its being designed by
      the conspirators to marry her to Henry of Richmond, he felt that it would
      much strengthen him and weaken them, to be beforehand with them, and marry
      her to his son.&nbsp; With this view he went to the Sanctuary at
      Westminster, where the late King&rsquo;s widow and her daughter still
      were, and besought them to come to Court: where (he swore by anything and
      everything) they should be safely and honourably entertained.&nbsp; They
      came, accordingly, but had scarcely been at Court a month when his son
      died suddenly&mdash;or was poisoned&mdash;and his plan was crushed to
      pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this extremity, King Richard, always active, thought, &lsquo;I must
      make another plan.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he made the plan of marrying the
      Princess Elizabeth himself, although she was his niece.&nbsp; There was
      one difficulty in the way: his wife, the Queen Anne, was alive.&nbsp; But,
      he knew (remembering his nephews) how to remove that obstacle, and he made
      love to the Princess Elizabeth, telling her he felt perfectly confident
      that the Queen would die in February.&nbsp; The Princess was not a very
      scrupulous young lady, for, instead of rejecting the murderer of her
      brothers with scorn and hatred, she openly declared she loved him dearly;
      and, when February came and the Queen did not die, she expressed her
      impatient opinion that she was too long about it.&nbsp; However, King
      Richard was not so far out in his prediction, but, that she died in March&mdash;he
      took good care of that&mdash;and then this precious pair hoped to be
      married.&nbsp; But they were disappointed, for the idea of such a marriage
      was so unpopular in the country, that the King&rsquo;s chief counsellors,
      <span class="smcap">Ratcliffe</span> and <span class="smcap">Catesby</span>,
      would by no means undertake to propose it, and the King was even obliged
      to declare in public that he had never thought of such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, by this time, dreaded and hated by all classes of his subjects.&nbsp;
      His nobles deserted every day to Henry&rsquo;s side; he dared not call
      another Parliament, lest his crimes should be denounced there; and for
      want of money, he was obliged to get Benevolences from the citizens, which
      exasperated them all against him.&nbsp; It was said too, that, being
      stricken by his conscience, he dreamed frightful dreams, and started up in
      the night-time, wild with terror and remorse.&nbsp; Active to the last,
      through all this, he issued vigorous proclamations against Henry of
      Richmond and all his followers, when he heard that they were coming
      against him with a Fleet from France; and took the field as fierce and
      savage as a wild boar&mdash;the animal represented on his shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry of Richmond landed with six thousand men at Milford Haven, and came
      on against King Richard, then encamped at Leicester with an army twice as
      great, through North Wales.&nbsp; On Bosworth Field the two armies met;
      and Richard, looking along Henry&rsquo;s ranks, and seeing them crowded
      with the English nobles who had abandoned him, turned pale when he beheld
      the powerful Lord Stanley and his son (whom he had tried hard to retain)
      among them.&nbsp; But, he was as brave as he was wicked, and plunged into
      the thickest of the fight.&nbsp; He was riding hither and thither, laying
      about him in all directions, when he observed the Earl of Northumberland&mdash;one
      of his few great allies&mdash;to stand inactive, and the main body of his
      troops to hesitate.&nbsp; At the same moment, his desperate glance caught
      Henry of Richmond among a little group of his knights.&nbsp; Riding hard
      at him, and crying &lsquo;Treason!&rsquo; he killed his standard-bearer,
      fiercely unhorsed another gentleman, and aimed a powerful stroke at Henry
      himself, to cut him down.&nbsp; But, Sir William Stanley parried it as it
      fell, and before Richard could raise his arm again, he was borne down in a
      press of numbers, unhorsed, and killed.&nbsp; Lord Stanley picked up the
      crown, all bruised and trampled, and stained with blood, and put it upon
      Richmond&rsquo;s head, amid loud and rejoicing cries of &lsquo;Long live
      King Henry!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, a horse was led up to the church of the Grey Friars at
      Leicester; across whose back was tied, like some worthless sack, a naked
      body brought there for burial.&nbsp; It was the body of the last of the
      Plantagenet line, King Richard the Third, usurper and murderer, slain at
      the battle of Bosworth Field in the thirty-second year of his age, after a
      reign of two years.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SEVENTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      King Henry the Seventh did not turn out to be as fine a fellow as the
      nobility and people hoped, in the first joy of their deliverance from
      Richard the Third.&nbsp; He was very cold, crafty, and calculating, and
      would do almost anything for money.&nbsp; He possessed considerable
      ability, but his chief merit appears to have been that he was not cruel
      when there was nothing to be got by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new King had promised the nobles who had espoused his cause that he
      would marry the Princess Elizabeth.&nbsp; The first thing he did, was, to
      direct her to be removed from the castle of Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire,
      where Richard had placed her, and restored to the care of her mother in
      London.&nbsp; The young Earl of Warwick, Edward Plantagenet, son and heir
      of the late Duke of Clarence, had been kept a prisoner in the same old
      Yorkshire Castle with her.&nbsp; This boy, who was now fifteen, the new
      King placed in the Tower for safety.&nbsp; Then he came to London in great
      state, and gratified the people with a fine procession; on which kind of
      show he often very much relied for keeping them in good humour.&nbsp; The
      sports and feasts which took place were followed by a terrible fever,
      called the Sweating Sickness; of which great numbers of people died.&nbsp;
      Lord Mayors and Aldermen are thought to have suffered most from it;
      whether, because they were in the habit of over-eating themselves, or
      because they were very jealous of preserving filth and nuisances in the
      City (as they have been since), I don&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King&rsquo;s coronation was postponed on account of the general
      ill-health, and he afterwards deferred his marriage, as if he were not
      very anxious that it should take place: and, even after that, deferred the
      Queen&rsquo;s coronation so long that he gave offence to the York party.&nbsp;
      However, he set these things right in the end, by hanging some men and
      seizing on the rich possessions of others; by granting more popular
      pardons to the followers of the late King than could, at first, be got
      from him; and, by employing about his Court, some very scrupulous persons
      who had been employed in the previous reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this reign was principally remarkable for two very curious impostures
      which have become famous in history, we will make those two stories its
      principal feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a priest at Oxford of the name of Simons, who had for a pupil a
      handsome boy named Lambert Simnel, the son of a baker.&nbsp; Partly to
      gratify his own ambitious ends, and partly to carry out the designs of a
      secret party formed against the King, this priest declared that his pupil,
      the boy, was no other than the young Earl of Warwick; who (as everybody
      might have known) was safely locked up in the Tower of London.&nbsp; The
      priest and the boy went over to Ireland; and, at Dublin, enlisted in their
      cause all ranks of the people: who seem to have been generous enough, but
      exceedingly irrational.&nbsp; The Earl of Kildare, the governor of
      Ireland, declared that he believed the boy to be what the priest
      represented; and the boy, who had been well tutored by the priest, told
      them such things of his childhood, and gave them so many descriptions of
      the Royal Family, that they were perpetually shouting and hurrahing, and
      drinking his health, and making all kinds of noisy and thirsty
      demonstrations, to express their belief in him.&nbsp; Nor was this feeling
      confined to Ireland alone, for the Earl of Lincoln&mdash;whom the late
      usurper had named as his successor&mdash;went over to the young Pretender;
      and, after holding a secret correspondence with the Dowager Duchess of
      Burgundy&mdash;the sister of Edward the Fourth, who detested the present
      King and all his race&mdash;sailed to Dublin with two thousand German
      soldiers of her providing.&nbsp; In this promising state of the boy&rsquo;s
      fortunes, he was crowned there, with a crown taken off the head of a
      statue of the Virgin Mary; and was then, according to the Irish custom of
      those days, carried home on the shoulders of a big chieftain possessing a
      great deal more strength than sense.&nbsp; Father Simons, you may be sure,
      was mighty busy at the coronation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days afterwards, the Germans, and the Irish, and the priest, and the
      boy, and the Earl of Lincoln, all landed in Lancashire to invade England.&nbsp;
      The King, who had good intelligence of their movements, set up his
      standard at Nottingham, where vast numbers resorted to him every day;
      while the Earl of Lincoln could gain but very few.&nbsp; With his small
      force he tried to make for the town of Newark; but the King&rsquo;s army
      getting between him and that place, he had no choice but to risk a battle
      at Stoke.&nbsp; It soon ended in the complete destruction of the Pretender&rsquo;s
      forces, one half of whom were killed; among them, the Earl himself.&nbsp;
      The priest and the baker&rsquo;s boy were taken prisoners.&nbsp; The
      priest, after confessing the trick, was shut up in prison, where he
      afterwards died&mdash;suddenly perhaps.&nbsp; The boy was taken into the
      King&rsquo;s kitchen and made a turnspit.&nbsp; He was afterwards raised
      to the station of one of the King&rsquo;s falconers; and so ended this
      strange imposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seems reason to suspect that the Dowager Queen&mdash;always a
      restless and busy woman&mdash;had had some share in tutoring the baker&rsquo;s
      son.&nbsp; The King was very angry with her, whether or no.&nbsp; He
      seized upon her property, and shut her up in a convent at Bermondsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might suppose that the end of this story would have put the Irish
      people on their guard; but they were quite ready to receive a second
      impostor, as they had received the first, and that same troublesome
      Duchess of Burgundy soon gave them the opportunity.&nbsp; All of a sudden
      there appeared at Cork, in a vessel arriving from Portugal, a young man of
      excellent abilities, of very handsome appearance and most winning manners,
      who declared himself to be Richard, Duke of York, the second son of King
      Edward the Fourth.&nbsp; &lsquo;O,&rsquo; said some, even of those ready
      Irish believers, &lsquo;but surely that young Prince was murdered by his
      uncle in the Tower!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It <i>is</i> supposed so,&rsquo;
      said the engaging young man; &lsquo;and my brother <i>was</i> killed in
      that gloomy prison; but I escaped&mdash;it don&rsquo;t matter how, at
      present&mdash;and have been wandering about the world for seven long
      years.&rsquo;&nbsp; This explanation being quite satisfactory to numbers
      of the Irish people, they began again to shout and to hurrah, and to drink
      his health, and to make the noisy and thirsty demonstrations all over
      again.&nbsp; And the big chieftain in Dublin began to look out for another
      coronation, and another young King to be carried home on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, King Henry being then on bad terms with France, the French King,
      Charles the Eighth, saw that, by pretending to believe in the handsome
      young man, he could trouble his enemy sorely.&nbsp; So, he invited him
      over to the French Court, and appointed him a body-guard, and treated him
      in all respects as if he really were the Duke of York.&nbsp; Peace,
      however, being soon concluded between the two Kings, the pretended Duke
      was turned adrift, and wandered for protection to the Duchess of Burgundy.&nbsp;
      She, after feigning to inquire into the reality of his claims, declared
      him to be the very picture of her dear departed brother; gave him a
      body-guard at her Court, of thirty halberdiers; and called him by the
      sounding name of the White Rose of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leading members of the White Rose party in England sent over an agent,
      named Sir Robert Clifford, to ascertain whether the White Rose&rsquo;s
      claims were good: the King also sent over his agents to inquire into the
      Rose&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; The White Roses declared the young man to be
      really the Duke of York; the King declared him to be <span class="smcap">Perkin
      Warbeck</span>, the son of a merchant of the city of Tournay, who had
      acquired his knowledge of England, its language and manners, from the
      English merchants who traded in Flanders; it was also stated by the Royal
      agents that he had been in the service of Lady Brompton, the wife of an
      exiled English nobleman, and that the Duchess of Burgundy had caused him
      to be trained and taught, expressly for this deception.&nbsp; The King
      then required the Archduke Philip&mdash;who was the sovereign of Burgundy&mdash;to
      banish this new Pretender, or to deliver him up; but, as the Archduke
      replied that he could not control the Duchess in her own land, the King,
      in revenge, took the market of English cloth away from Antwerp, and
      prevented all commercial intercourse between the two countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also, by arts and bribes, prevailed on Sir Robert Clifford to betray
      his employers; and he denouncing several famous English noblemen as being
      secretly the friends of Perkin Warbeck, the King had three of the foremost
      executed at once.&nbsp; Whether he pardoned the remainder because they
      were poor, I do not know; but it is only too probable that he refused to
      pardon one famous nobleman against whom the same Clifford soon afterwards
      informed separately, because he was rich.&nbsp; This was no other than Sir
      William Stanley, who had saved the King&rsquo;s life at the battle of
      Bosworth Field.&nbsp; It is very doubtful whether his treason amounted to
      much more than his having said, that if he were sure the young man was the
      Duke of York, he would not take arms against him.&nbsp; Whatever he had
      done he admitted, like an honourable spirit; and he lost his head for it,
      and the covetous King gained all his wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkin Warbeck kept quiet for three years; but, as the Flemings began to
      complain heavily of the loss of their trade by the stoppage of the Antwerp
      market on his account, and as it was not unlikely that they might even go
      so far as to take his life, or give him up, he found it necessary to do
      something.&nbsp; Accordingly he made a desperate sally, and landed, with
      only a few hundred men, on the coast of Deal.&nbsp; But he was soon glad
      to get back to the place from whence he came; for the country people rose
      against his followers, killed a great many, and took a hundred and fifty
      prisoners: who were all driven to London, tied together with ropes, like a
      team of cattle.&nbsp; Every one of them was hanged on some part or other
      of the sea-shore; in order, that if any more men should come over with
      Perkin Warbeck, they might see the bodies as a warning before they landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wary King, by making a treaty of commerce with the Flemings,
      drove Perkin Warbeck out of that country; and, by completely gaining over
      the Irish to his side, deprived him of that asylum too.&nbsp; He wandered
      away to Scotland, and told his story at that Court.&nbsp; King James the
      Fourth of Scotland, who was no friend to King Henry, and had no reason to
      be (for King Henry had bribed his Scotch lords to betray him more than
      once; but had never succeeded in his plots), gave him a great reception,
      called him his cousin, and gave him in marriage the Lady Catherine Gordon,
      a beautiful and charming creature related to the royal house of Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed by this successful reappearance of the Pretender, the King still
      undermined, and bought, and bribed, and kept his doings and Perkin Warbeck&rsquo;s
      story in the dark, when he might, one would imagine, have rendered the
      matter clear to all England.&nbsp; But, for all this bribing of the Scotch
      lords at the Scotch King&rsquo;s Court, he could not procure the Pretender
      to be delivered up to him.&nbsp; James, though not very particular in many
      respects, would not betray him; and the ever-busy Duchess of Burgundy so
      provided him with arms, and good soldiers, and with money besides, that he
      had soon a little army of fifteen hundred men of various nations.&nbsp;
      With these, and aided by the Scottish King in person, he crossed the
      border into England, and made a proclamation to the people, in which he
      called the King &lsquo;Henry Tudor;&rsquo; offered large rewards to any
      who should take or distress him; and announced himself as King Richard the
      Fourth come to receive the homage of his faithful subjects.&nbsp; His
      faithful subjects, however, cared nothing for him, and hated his faithful
      troops: who, being of different nations, quarrelled also among themselves.&nbsp;
      Worse than this, if worse were possible, they began to plunder the
      country; upon which the White Rose said, that he would rather lose his
      rights, than gain them through the miseries of the English people.&nbsp;
      The Scottish King made a jest of his scruples; but they and their whole
      force went back again without fighting a battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst consequence of this attempt was, that a rising took place among
      the people of Cornwall, who considered themselves too heavily taxed to
      meet the charges of the expected war.&nbsp; Stimulated by Flammock, a
      lawyer, and Joseph, a blacksmith, and joined by Lord Audley and some other
      country gentlemen, they marched on all the way to Deptford Bridge, where
      they fought a battle with the King&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; They were defeated&mdash;though
      the Cornish men fought with great bravery&mdash;and the lord was beheaded,
      and the lawyer and the blacksmith were hanged, drawn, and quartered.&nbsp;
      The rest were pardoned.&nbsp; The King, who believed every man to be as
      avaricious as himself, and thought that money could settle anything,
      allowed them to make bargains for their liberty with the soldiers who had
      taken them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkin Warbeck, doomed to wander up and down, and never to find rest
      anywhere&mdash;a sad fate: almost a sufficient punishment for an
      imposture, which he seems in time to have half believed himself&mdash;lost
      his Scottish refuge through a truce being made between the two Kings; and
      found himself, once more, without a country before him in which he could
      lay his head.&nbsp; But James (always honourable and true to him, alike
      when he melted down his plate, and even the great gold chain he had been
      used to wear, to pay soldiers in his cause; and now, when that cause was
      lost and hopeless) did not conclude the treaty, until he had safely
      departed out of the Scottish dominions.&nbsp; He, and his beautiful wife,
      who was faithful to him under all reverses, and left her state and home to
      follow his poor fortunes, were put aboard ship with everything necessary
      for their comfort and protection, and sailed for Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, the Irish people had had enough of counterfeit Earls of Warwick and
      Dukes of York, for one while; and would give the White Rose no aid.&nbsp;
      So, the White Rose&mdash;encircled by thorns indeed&mdash;resolved to go
      with his beautiful wife to Cornwall as a forlorn resource, and see what
      might be made of the Cornish men, who had risen so valiantly a little
      while before, and who had fought so bravely at Deptford Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall, accordingly, came Perkin Warbeck and his
      wife; and the lovely lady he shut up for safety in the Castle of St.
      Michael&rsquo;s Mount, and then marched into Devonshire at the head of
      three thousand Cornishmen.&nbsp; These were increased to six thousand by
      the time of his arrival in Exeter; but, there the people made a stout
      resistance, and he went on to Taunton, where he came in sight of the King&rsquo;s
      army.&nbsp; The stout Cornish men, although they were few in number, and
      badly armed, were so bold, that they never thought of retreating; but
      bravely looked forward to a battle on the morrow.&nbsp; Unhappily for
      them, the man who was possessed of so many engaging qualities, and who
      attracted so many people to his side when he had nothing else with which
      to tempt them, was not as brave as they.&nbsp; In the night, when the two
      armies lay opposite to each other, he mounted a swift horse and fled.&nbsp;
      When morning dawned, the poor confiding Cornish men, discovering that they
      had no leader, surrendered to the King&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; Some of them
      were hanged, and the rest were pardoned and went miserably home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the King pursued Perkin Warbeck to the sanctuary of Beaulieu in the
      New Forest, where it was soon known that he had taken refuge, he sent a
      body of horsemen to St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, to seize his wife.&nbsp;
      She was soon taken and brought as a captive before the King.&nbsp; But she
      was so beautiful, and so good, and so devoted to the man in whom she
      believed, that the King regarded her with compassion, treated her with
      great respect, and placed her at Court, near the Queen&rsquo;s person.&nbsp;
      And many years after Perkin Warbeck was no more, and when his strange
      story had become like a nursery tale, <i>she</i> was called the White
      Rose, by the people, in remembrance of her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sanctuary at Beaulieu was soon surrounded by the King&rsquo;s men; and
      the King, pursuing his usual dark, artful ways, sent pretended friends to
      Perkin Warbeck to persuade him to come out and surrender himself.&nbsp;
      This he soon did; the King having taken a good look at the man of whom he
      had heard so much&mdash;from behind a screen&mdash;directed him to be well
      mounted, and to ride behind him at a little distance, guarded, but not
      bound in any way.&nbsp; So they entered London with the King&rsquo;s
      favourite show&mdash;a procession; and some of the people hooted as the
      Pretender rode slowly through the streets to the Tower; but the greater
      part were quiet, and very curious to see him.&nbsp; From the Tower, he was
      taken to the Palace at Westminster, and there lodged like a gentleman,
      though closely watched.&nbsp; He was examined every now and then as to his
      imposture; but the King was so secret in all he did, that even then he
      gave it a consequence, which it cannot be supposed to have in itself
      deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Perkin Warbeck ran away, and took refuge in another sanctuary near
      Richmond in Surrey.&nbsp; From this he was again persuaded to deliver
      himself up; and, being conveyed to London, he stood in the stocks for a
      whole day, outside Westminster Hall, and there read a paper purporting to
      be his full confession, and relating his history as the King&rsquo;s
      agents had originally described it.&nbsp; He was then shut up in the Tower
      again, in the company of the Earl of Warwick, who had now been there for
      fourteen years: ever since his removal out of Yorkshire, except when the
      King had had him at Court, and had shown him to the people, to prove the
      imposture of the Baker&rsquo;s boy.&nbsp; It is but too probable, when we
      consider the crafty character of Henry the Seventh, that these two were
      brought together for a cruel purpose.&nbsp; A plot was soon discovered
      between them and the keepers, to murder the Governor, get possession of
      the keys, and proclaim Perkin Warbeck as King Richard the Fourth.&nbsp;
      That there was some such plot, is likely; that they were tempted into it,
      is at least as likely; that the unfortunate Earl of Warwick&mdash;last
      male of the Plantagenet line&mdash;was too unused to the world, and too
      ignorant and simple to know much about it, whatever it was, is perfectly
      certain; and that it was the King&rsquo;s interest to get rid of him, is
      no less so.&nbsp; He was beheaded on Tower Hill, and Perkin Warbeck was
      hanged at Tyburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the end of the pretended Duke of York, whose shadowy history was
      made more shadowy&mdash;and ever will be&mdash;by the mystery and craft of
      the King.&nbsp; If he had turned his great natural advantages to a more
      honest account, he might have lived a happy and respected life, even in
      those days.&nbsp; But he died upon a gallows at Tyburn, leaving the
      Scottish lady, who had loved him so well, kindly protected at the Queen&rsquo;s
      Court.&nbsp; After some time she forgot her old loves and troubles, as
      many people do with Time&rsquo;s merciful assistance, and married a Welsh
      gentleman.&nbsp; Her second husband, <span class="smcap">Sir Matthew
      Cradoc</span>, more honest and more happy than her first, lies beside her
      in a tomb in the old church of Swansea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ill-blood between France and England in this reign, arose out of the
      continued plotting of the Duchess of Burgundy, and disputes respecting the
      affairs of Brittany.&nbsp; The King feigned to be very patriotic,
      indignant, and warlike; but he always contrived so as never to make war in
      reality, and always to make money.&nbsp; His taxation of the people, on
      pretence of war with France, involved, at one time, a very dangerous
      insurrection, headed by Sir John Egremont, and a common man called John
      &agrave; Chambre.&nbsp; But it was subdued by the royal forces, under the
      command of the Earl of Surrey.&nbsp; The knighted John escaped to the
      Duchess of Burgundy, who was ever ready to receive any one who gave the
      King trouble; and the plain John was hanged at York, in the midst of a
      number of his men, but on a much higher gibbet, as being a greater
      traitor.&nbsp; Hung high or hung low, however, hanging is much the same to
      the person hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a year after her marriage, the Queen had given birth to a son, who
      was called Prince Arthur, in remembrance of the old British prince of
      romance and story; and who, when all these events had happened, being then
      in his fifteenth year, was married to <span class="smcap">Catherine</span>,
      the daughter of the Spanish monarch, with great rejoicings and bright
      prospects; but in a very few months he sickened and died.&nbsp; As soon as
      the King had recovered from his grief, he thought it a pity that the
      fortune of the Spanish Princess, amounting to two hundred thousand crowns,
      should go out of the family; and therefore arranged that the young widow
      should marry his second son <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, then twelve
      years of age, when he too should be fifteen.&nbsp; There were objections
      to this marriage on the part of the clergy; but, as the infallible Pope
      was gained over, and, as he <i>must</i> be right, that settled the
      business for the time.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s eldest daughter was provided
      for, and a long course of disturbance was considered to be set at rest, by
      her being married to the Scottish King.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the Queen died.&nbsp; When the King had got over that grief too,
      his mind once more reverted to his darling money for consolation, and he
      thought of marrying the Dowager Queen of Naples, who was immensely rich:
      but, as it turned out not to be practicable to gain the money however
      practicable it might have been to gain the lady, he gave up the idea.&nbsp;
      He was not so fond of her but that he soon proposed to marry the Dowager
      Duchess of Savoy; and, soon afterwards, the widow of the King of Castile,
      who was raving mad.&nbsp; But he made a money-bargain instead, and married
      neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess of Burgundy, among the other discontented people to whom she
      had given refuge, had sheltered <span class="smcap">Edmund de la Pole</span>
      (younger brother of that Earl of Lincoln who was killed at Stoke), now
      Earl of Suffolk.&nbsp; The King had prevailed upon him to return to the
      marriage of Prince Arthur; but, he soon afterwards went away again; and
      then the King, suspecting a conspiracy, resorted to his favourite plan of
      sending him some treacherous friends, and buying of those scoundrels the
      secrets they disclosed or invented.&nbsp; Some arrests and executions took
      place in consequence.&nbsp; In the end, the King, on a promise of not
      taking his life, obtained possession of the person of Edmund de la Pole,
      and shut him up in the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was his last enemy.&nbsp; If he had lived much longer he would have
      made many more among the people, by the grinding exaction to which he
      constantly exposed them, and by the tyrannical acts of his two prime
      favourites in all money-raising matters, <span class="smcap">Edmund Dudley</span>
      and <span class="smcap">Richard Empson</span>.&nbsp; But Death&mdash;the
      enemy who is not to be bought off or deceived, and on whom no money, and
      no treachery has any effect&mdash;presented himself at this juncture, and
      ended the King&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; He died of the gout, on the
      twenty-second of April, one thousand five hundred and nine, and in the
      fifty-third year of his age, after reigning twenty-four years; he was
      buried in the beautiful Chapel of Westminster Abbey, which he had himself
      founded, and which still bears his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this reign that the great <span class="smcap">Christopher
      Columbus</span>, on behalf of Spain, discovered what was then called The
      New World.&nbsp; Great wonder, interest, and hope of wealth being awakened
      in England thereby, the King and the merchants of London and Bristol
      fitted out an English expedition for further discoveries in the New World,
      and entrusted it to <span class="smcap">Sebastian Cabot</span>, of
      Bristol, the son of a Venetian pilot there.&nbsp; He was very successful
      in his voyage, and gained high reputation, both for himself and England.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH, CALLED BLUFF KING HAL
      AND BURLY KING HARRY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PART THE FIRST
    </h3>
    <p>
      We now come to King Henry the Eighth, whom it has been too much the
      fashion to call &lsquo;Bluff King Hal,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Burly King Harry,&rsquo;
      and other fine names; but whom I shall take the liberty to call, plainly,
      one of the most detestable villains that ever drew breath.&nbsp; You will
      be able to judge, long before we come to the end of his life, whether he
      deserves the character.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was just eighteen years of age when he came to the throne.&nbsp; People
      said he was handsome then; but I don&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; He was a
      big, burly, noisy, small-eyed, large-faced, double-chinned,
      swinish-looking fellow in later life (as we know from the likenesses of
      him, painted by the famous <span class="smcap">Hans Holbein</span>), and
      it is not easy to believe that so bad a character can ever have been
      veiled under a prepossessing appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was anxious to make himself popular; and the people, who had long
      disliked the late King, were very willing to believe that he deserved to
      be so.&nbsp; He was extremely fond of show and display, and so were they.&nbsp;
      Therefore there was great rejoicing when he married the Princess
      Catherine, and when they were both crowned.&nbsp; And the King fought at
      tournaments and always came off victorious&mdash;for the courtiers took
      care of that&mdash;and there was a general outcry that he was a wonderful
      man.&nbsp; Empson, Dudley, and their supporters were accused of a variety
      of crimes they had never committed, instead of the offences of which they
      really had been guilty; and they were pilloried, and set upon horses with
      their faces to the tails, and knocked about and beheaded, to the
      satisfaction of the people, and the enrichment of the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope, so indefatigable in getting the world into trouble, had mixed
      himself up in a war on the continent of Europe, occasioned by the reigning
      Princes of little quarrelling states in Italy having at various times
      married into other Royal families, and so led to <i>their</i> claiming a
      share in those petty Governments.&nbsp; The King, who discovered that he
      was very fond of the Pope, sent a herald to the King of France, to say
      that he must not make war upon that holy personage, because he was the
      father of all Christians.&nbsp; As the French King did not mind this
      relationship in the least, and also refused to admit a claim King Henry
      made to certain lands in France, war was declared between the two
      countries.&nbsp; Not to perplex this story with an account of the tricks
      and designs of all the sovereigns who were engaged in it, it is enough to
      say that England made a blundering alliance with Spain, and got stupidly
      taken in by that country; which made its own terms with France when it
      could and left England in the lurch.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Sir Edward
      Howard</span>, a bold admiral, son of the Earl of Surrey, distinguished
      himself by his bravery against the French in this business; but,
      unfortunately, he was more brave than wise, for, skimming into the French
      harbour of Brest with only a few row-boats, he attempted (in revenge for
      the defeat and death of <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Knyvett</span>,
      another bold English admiral) to take some strong French ships, well
      defended with batteries of cannon.&nbsp; The upshot was, that he was left
      on board of one of them (in consequence of its shooting away from his own
      boat), with not more than about a dozen men, and was thrown into the sea
      and drowned: though not until he had taken from his breast his gold chain
      and gold whistle, which were the signs of his office, and had cast them
      into the sea to prevent their being made a boast of by the enemy.&nbsp;
      After this defeat&mdash;which was a great one, for Sir Edward Howard was a
      man of valour and fame&mdash;the King took it into his head to invade
      France in person; first executing that dangerous Earl of Suffolk whom his
      father had left in the Tower, and appointing Queen Catherine to the charge
      of his kingdom in his absence.&nbsp; He sailed to Calais, where he was
      joined by <span class="smcap">Maximilian</span>, Emperor of Germany, who
      pretended to be his soldier, and who took pay in his service: with a good
      deal of nonsense of that sort, flattering enough to the vanity of a vain
      blusterer.&nbsp; The King might be successful enough in sham fights; but
      his idea of real battles chiefly consisted in pitching silken tents of
      bright colours that were ignominiously blown down by the wind, and in
      making a vast display of gaudy flags and golden curtains.&nbsp; Fortune,
      however, favoured him better than he deserved; for, after much waste of
      time in tent pitching, flag flying, gold curtaining, and other such
      masquerading, he gave the French battle at a place called Guinegate: where
      they took such an unaccountable panic, and fled with such swiftness, that
      it was ever afterwards called by the English the Battle of Spurs.&nbsp;
      Instead of following up his advantage, the King, finding that he had had
      enough of real fighting, came home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scottish King, though nearly related to Henry by marriage, had taken
      part against him in this war.&nbsp; The Earl of Surrey, as the English
      general, advanced to meet him when he came out of his own dominions and
      crossed the river Tweed.&nbsp; The two armies came up with one another
      when the Scottish King had also crossed the river Till, and was encamped
      upon the last of the Cheviot Hills, called the Hill of Flodden.&nbsp;
      Along the plain below it, the English, when the hour of battle came,
      advanced.&nbsp; The Scottish army, which had been drawn up in five great
      bodies, then came steadily down in perfect silence.&nbsp; So they, in
      their turn, advanced to meet the English army, which came on in one long
      line; and they attacked it with a body of spearmen, under <span
      class="smcap">Lord Home</span>.&nbsp; At first they had the best of it;
      but the English recovered themselves so bravely, and fought with such
      valour, that, when the Scottish King had almost made his way up to the
      Royal Standard, he was slain, and the whole Scottish power routed.&nbsp;
      Ten thousand Scottish men lay dead that day on Flodden Field; and among
      them, numbers of the nobility and gentry.&nbsp; For a long time
      afterwards, the Scottish peasantry used to believe that their King had not
      been really killed in this battle, because no Englishman had found an iron
      belt he wore about his body as a penance for having been an unnatural and
      undutiful son.&nbsp; But, whatever became of his belt, the English had his
      sword and dagger, and the ring from his finger, and his body too, covered
      with wounds.&nbsp; There is no doubt of it; for it was seen and recognised
      by English gentlemen who had known the Scottish King well.
    </p>
    <p>
      When King Henry was making ready to renew the war in France, the French
      King was contemplating peace.&nbsp; His queen, dying at this time, he
      proposed, though he was upwards of fifty years old, to marry King Henry&rsquo;s
      sister, the Princess Mary, who, besides being only sixteen, was betrothed
      to the Duke of Suffolk.&nbsp; As the inclinations of young Princesses were
      not much considered in such matters, the marriage was concluded, and the
      poor girl was escorted to France, where she was immediately left as the
      French King&rsquo;s bride, with only one of all her English attendants.&nbsp;
      That one was a pretty young girl named <span class="smcap">Anne Boleyn</span>,
      niece of the Earl of Surrey, who had been made Duke of Norfolk, after the
      victory of Flodden Field.&nbsp; Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s is a name to be
      remembered, as you will presently find.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the French King, who was very proud of his young wife, was
      preparing for many years of happiness, and she was looking forward, I dare
      say, to many years of misery, when he died within three months, and left
      her a young widow.&nbsp; The new French monarch, <span class="smcap">Francis
      the First</span>, seeing how important it was to his interests that she
      should take for her second husband no one but an Englishman, advised her
      first lover, the Duke of Suffolk, when King Henry sent him over to France
      to fetch her home, to marry her.&nbsp; The Princess being herself so fond
      of that Duke, as to tell him that he must either do so then, or for ever
      lose her, they were wedded; and Henry afterwards forgave them.&nbsp; In
      making interest with the King, the Duke of Suffolk had addressed his most
      powerful favourite and adviser, <span class="smcap">Thomas Wolsey</span>&mdash;a
      name very famous in history for its rise and downfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wolsey was the son of a respectable butcher at Ipswich, in Suffolk and
      received so excellent an education that he became a tutor to the family of
      the Marquis of Dorset, who afterwards got him appointed one of the late
      King&rsquo;s chaplains.&nbsp; On the accession of Henry the Eighth, he was
      promoted and taken into great favour.&nbsp; He was now Archbishop of York;
      the Pope had made him a Cardinal besides; and whoever wanted influence in
      England or favour with the King&mdash;whether he were a foreign monarch or
      an English nobleman&mdash;was obliged to make a friend of the great
      Cardinal Wolsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a gay man, who could dance and jest, and sing and drink; and those
      were the roads to so much, or rather so little, of a heart as King Henry
      had.&nbsp; He was wonderfully fond of pomp and glitter, and so was the
      King.&nbsp; He knew a good deal of the Church learning of that time; much
      of which consisted in finding artful excuses and pretences for almost any
      wrong thing, and in arguing that black was white, or any other colour.&nbsp;
      This kind of learning pleased the King too.&nbsp; For many such reasons,
      the Cardinal was high in estimation with the King; and, being a man of far
      greater ability, knew as well how to manage him, as a clever keeper may
      know how to manage a wolf or a tiger, or any other cruel and uncertain
      beast, that may turn upon him and tear him any day.&nbsp; Never had there
      been seen in England such state as my Lord Cardinal kept.&nbsp; His wealth
      was enormous; equal, it was reckoned, to the riches of the Crown.&nbsp;
      His palaces were as splendid as the King&rsquo;s, and his retinue was
      eight hundred strong.&nbsp; He held his Court, dressed out from top to toe
      in flaming scarlet; and his very shoes were golden, set with precious
      stones.&nbsp; His followers rode on blood horses; while he, with a
      wonderful affectation of humility in the midst of his great splendour,
      ambled on a mule with a red velvet saddle and bridle and golden stirrups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the influence of this stately priest, a grand meeting was arranged
      to take place between the French and English Kings in France; but on
      ground belonging to England.&nbsp; A prodigious show of friendship and
      rejoicing was to be made on the occasion; and heralds were sent to
      proclaim with brazen trumpets through all the principal cities of Europe,
      that, on a certain day, the Kings of France and England, as companions and
      brothers in arms, each attended by eighteen followers, would hold a
      tournament against all knights who might choose to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Charles</span>, the new Emperor of Germany (the old
      one being dead), wanted to prevent too cordial an alliance between these
      sovereigns, and came over to England before the King could repair to the
      place of meeting; and, besides making an agreeable impression upon him,
      secured Wolsey&rsquo;s interest by promising that his influence should
      make him Pope when the next vacancy occurred.&nbsp; On the day when the
      Emperor left England, the King and all the Court went over to Calais, and
      thence to the place of meeting, between Ardres and Guisnes, commonly
      called the Field of the Cloth of Gold.&nbsp; Here, all manner of expense
      and prodigality was lavished on the decorations of the show; many of the
      knights and gentlemen being so superbly dressed that it was said they
      carried their whole estates upon their shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sham castles, temporary chapels, fountains running wine, great
      cellars full of wine free as water to all comers, silk tents, gold lace
      and foil, gilt lions, and such things without end; and, in the midst of
      all, the rich Cardinal out-shone and out-glittered all the noblemen and
      gentlemen assembled.&nbsp; After a treaty made between the two Kings with
      as much solemnity as if they had intended to keep it, the lists&mdash;nine
      hundred feet long, and three hundred and twenty broad&mdash;were opened
      for the tournament; the Queens of France and England looking on with great
      array of lords and ladies.&nbsp; Then, for ten days, the two sovereigns
      fought five combats every day, and always beat their polite adversaries;
      though they <i>do</i> write that the King of England, being thrown in a
      wrestle one day by the King of France, lost his kingly temper with his
      brother-in-arms, and wanted to make a quarrel of it.&nbsp; Then, there is
      a great story belonging to this Field of the Cloth of Gold, showing how
      the English were distrustful of the French, and the French of the English,
      until Francis rode alone one morning to Henry&rsquo;s tent; and, going in
      before he was out of bed, told him in joke that he was his prisoner; and
      how Henry jumped out of bed and embraced Francis; and how Francis helped
      Henry to dress, and warmed his linen for him; and how Henry gave Francis a
      splendid jewelled collar, and how Francis gave Henry, in return, a costly
      bracelet.&nbsp; All this and a great deal more was so written about, and
      sung about, and talked about at that time (and, indeed, since that time
      too), that the world has had good cause to be sick of it, for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, nothing came of all these fine doings but a speedy renewal of
      the war between England and France, in which the two Royal companions and
      brothers in arms longed very earnestly to damage one another.&nbsp; But,
      before it broke out again, the Duke of Buckingham was shamefully executed
      on Tower Hill, on the evidence of a discharged servant&mdash;really for
      nothing, except the folly of having believed in a friar of the name of
      <span class="smcap">Hopkins</span>, who had pretended to be a prophet, and
      who had mumbled and jumbled out some nonsense about the Duke&rsquo;s son
      being destined to be very great in the land.&nbsp; It was believed that
      the unfortunate Duke had given offence to the great Cardinal by expressing
      his mind freely about the expense and absurdity of the whole business of
      the Field of the Cloth of Gold.&nbsp; At any rate, he was beheaded, as I
      have said, for nothing.&nbsp; And the people who saw it done were very
      angry, and cried out that it was the work of &lsquo;the butcher&rsquo;s
      son!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The new war was a short one, though the Earl of Surrey invaded France
      again, and did some injury to that country.&nbsp; It ended in another
      treaty of peace between the two kingdoms, and in the discovery that the
      Emperor of Germany was not such a good friend to England in reality, as he
      pretended to be.&nbsp; Neither did he keep his promise to Wolsey to make
      him Pope, though the King urged him.&nbsp; Two Popes died in pretty quick
      succession; but the foreign priests were too much for the Cardinal, and
      kept him out of the post.&nbsp; So the Cardinal and King together found
      out that the Emperor of Germany was not a man to keep faith with; broke
      off a projected marriage between the King&rsquo;s daughter <span
      class="smcap">Mary</span>, Princess of Wales, and that sovereign; and
      began to consider whether it might not be well to marry the young lady,
      either to Francis himself, or to his eldest son.
    </p>
    <p>
      There now arose at Wittemberg, in Germany, the great leader of the mighty
      change in England which is called The Reformation, and which set the
      people free from their slavery to the priests.&nbsp; This was a learned
      Doctor, named <span class="smcap">Martin Luther</span>, who knew all about
      them, for he had been a priest, and even a monk, himself.&nbsp; The
      preaching and writing of Wickliffe had set a number of men thinking on
      this subject; and Luther, finding one day to his great surprise, that
      there really was a book called the New Testament which the priests did not
      allow to be read, and which contained truths that they suppressed, began
      to be very vigorous against the whole body, from the Pope downward.&nbsp;
      It happened, while he was yet only beginning his vast work of awakening
      the nation, that an impudent fellow named <span class="smcap">Tetzel</span>,
      a friar of very bad character, came into his neighbourhood selling what
      were called Indulgences, by wholesale, to raise money for beautifying the
      great Cathedral of St. Peter&rsquo;s, at Rome.&nbsp; Whoever bought an
      Indulgence of the Pope was supposed to buy himself off from the punishment
      of Heaven for his offences.&nbsp; Luther told the people that these
      Indulgences were worthless bits of paper, before God, and that Tetzel and
      his masters were a crew of impostors in selling them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King and the Cardinal were mightily indignant at this presumption; and
      the King (with the help of <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas More</span>, a
      wise man, whom he afterwards repaid by striking off his head) even wrote a
      book about it, with which the Pope was so well pleased that he gave the
      King the title of Defender of the Faith.&nbsp; The King and the Cardinal
      also issued flaming warnings to the people not to read Luther&rsquo;s
      books, on pain of excommunication.&nbsp; But they did read them for all
      that; and the rumour of what was in them spread far and wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this great change was thus going on, the King began to show himself
      in his truest and worst colours.&nbsp; Anne Boleyn, the pretty little girl
      who had gone abroad to France with his sister, was by this time grown up
      to be very beautiful, and was one of the ladies in attendance on Queen
      Catherine.&nbsp; Now, Queen Catherine was no longer young or handsome, and
      it is likely that she was not particularly good-tempered; having been
      always rather melancholy, and having been made more so by the deaths of
      four of her children when they were very young.&nbsp; So, the King fell in
      love with the fair Anne Boleyn, and said to himself, &lsquo;How can I be
      best rid of my own troublesome wife whom I am tired of, and marry Anne?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      You recollect that Queen Catherine had been the wife of Henry&rsquo;s
      brother.&nbsp; What does the King do, after thinking it over, but calls
      his favourite priests about him, and says, O! his mind is in such a
      dreadful state, and he is so frightfully uneasy, because he is afraid it
      was not lawful for him to marry the Queen!&nbsp; Not one of those priests
      had the courage to hint that it was rather curious he had never thought of
      that before, and that his mind seemed to have been in a tolerably jolly
      condition during a great many years, in which he certainly had not fretted
      himself thin; but, they all said, Ah! that was very true, and it was a
      serious business; and perhaps the best way to make it right, would be for
      his Majesty to be divorced!&nbsp; The King replied, Yes, he thought that
      would be the best way, certainly; so they all went to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to relate to you the intrigues and plots that took place in the
      endeavour to get this divorce, you would think the History of England the
      most tiresome book in the world.&nbsp; So I shall say no more, than that
      after a vast deal of negotiation and evasion, the Pope issued a commission
      to Cardinal Wolsey and <span class="smcap">Cardinal Campeggio</span> (whom
      he sent over from Italy for the purpose), to try the whole case in
      England.&nbsp; It is supposed&mdash;and I think with reason&mdash;that
      Wolsey was the Queen&rsquo;s enemy, because she had reproved him for his
      proud and gorgeous manner of life.&nbsp; But, he did not at first know
      that the King wanted to marry Anne Boleyn; and when he did know it, he
      even went down on his knees, in the endeavour to dissuade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinals opened their court in the Convent of the Black Friars, near
      to where the bridge of that name in London now stands; and the King and
      Queen, that they might be near it, took up their lodgings at the adjoining
      palace of Bridewell, of which nothing now remains but a bad prison.&nbsp;
      On the opening of the court, when the King and Queen were called on to
      appear, that poor ill-used lady, with a dignity and firmness and yet with
      a womanly affection worthy to be always admired, went and kneeled at the
      King&rsquo;s feet, and said that she had come, a stranger, to his
      dominions; that she had been a good and true wife to him for twenty years;
      and that she could acknowledge no power in those Cardinals to try whether
      she should be considered his wife after all that time, or should be put
      away.&nbsp; With that, she got up and left the court, and would never
      afterwards come back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King pretended to be very much overcome, and said, O! my lords and
      gentlemen, what a good woman she was to be sure, and how delighted he
      would be to live with her unto death, but for that terrible uneasiness in
      his mind which was quite wearing him away!&nbsp; So, the case went on, and
      there was nothing but talk for two months.&nbsp; Then Cardinal Campeggio,
      who, on behalf of the Pope, wanted nothing so much as delay, adjourned it
      for two more months; and before that time was elapsed, the Pope himself
      adjourned it indefinitely, by requiring the King and Queen to come to Rome
      and have it tried there.&nbsp; But by good luck for the King, word was
      brought to him by some of his people, that they had happened to meet at
      supper, <span class="smcap">Thomas Cranmer</span>, a learned Doctor of
      Cambridge, who had proposed to urge the Pope on, by referring the case to
      all the learned doctors and bishops, here and there and everywhere, and
      getting their opinions that the King&rsquo;s marriage was unlawful.&nbsp;
      The King, who was now in a hurry to marry Anne Boleyn, thought this such a
      good idea, that he sent for Cranmer, post haste, and said to <span
      class="smcap">Lord Rochfort</span>, Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s father, &lsquo;Take
      this learned Doctor down to your country-house, and there let him have a
      good room for a study, and no end of books out of which to prove that I
      may marry your daughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord Rochfort, not at all reluctant,
      made the learned Doctor as comfortable as he could; and the learned Doctor
      went to work to prove his case.&nbsp; All this time, the King and Anne
      Boleyn were writing letters to one another almost daily, full of
      impatience to have the case settled; and Anne Boleyn was showing herself
      (as I think) very worthy of the fate which afterwards befel her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bad for Cardinal Wolsey that he had left Cranmer to render this
      help.&nbsp; It was worse for him that he had tried to dissuade the King
      from marrying Anne Boleyn.&nbsp; Such a servant as he, to such a master as
      Henry, would probably have fallen in any case; but, between the hatred of
      the party of the Queen that was, and the hatred of the party of the Queen
      that was to be, he fell suddenly and heavily.&nbsp; Going down one day to
      the Court of Chancery, where he now presided, he was waited upon by the
      Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, who told him that they brought an order to
      him to resign that office, and to withdraw quietly to a house he had at
      Esher, in Surrey.&nbsp; The Cardinal refusing, they rode off to the King;
      and next day came back with a letter from him, on reading which, the
      Cardinal submitted.&nbsp; An inventory was made out of all the riches in
      his palace at York Place (now Whitehall), and he went sorrowfully up the
      river, in his barge, to Putney.&nbsp; An abject man he was, in spite of
      his pride; for being overtaken, riding out of that place towards Esher, by
      one of the King&rsquo;s chamberlains who brought him a kind message and a
      ring, he alighted from his mule, took off his cap, and kneeled down in the
      dirt.&nbsp; His poor Fool, whom in his prosperous days he had always kept
      in his palace to entertain him, cut a far better figure than he; for, when
      the Cardinal said to the chamberlain that he had nothing to send to his
      lord the King as a present, but that jester who was a most excellent one,
      it took six strong yeomen to remove the faithful fool from his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The once proud Cardinal was soon further disgraced, and wrote the most
      abject letters to his vile sovereign; who humbled him one day and
      encouraged him the next, according to his humour, until he was at last
      ordered to go and reside in his diocese of York.&nbsp; He said he was too
      poor; but I don&rsquo;t know how he made that out, for he took a hundred
      and sixty servants with him, and seventy-two cart-loads of furniture,
      food, and wine.&nbsp; He remained in that part of the country for the best
      part of a year, and showed himself so improved by his misfortunes, and was
      so mild and so conciliating, that he won all hearts.&nbsp; And indeed,
      even in his proud days, he had done some magnificent things for learning
      and education.&nbsp; At last, he was arrested for high treason; and,
      coming slowly on his journey towards London, got as far as Leicester.&nbsp;
      Arriving at Leicester Abbey after dark, and very ill, he said&mdash;when
      the monks came out at the gate with lighted torches to receive him&mdash;that
      he had come to lay his bones among them.&nbsp; He had indeed; for he was
      taken to a bed, from which he never rose again.&nbsp; His last words were,
      &lsquo;Had I but served God as diligently as I have served the King, He
      would not have given me over, in my grey hairs.&nbsp; Howbeit, this is my
      just reward for my pains and diligence, not regarding my service to God,
      but only my duty to my prince.&rsquo;&nbsp; The news of his death was
      quickly carried to the King, who was amusing himself with archery in the
      garden of the magnificent Palace at Hampton Court, which that very Wolsey
      had presented to him.&nbsp; The greatest emotion his royal mind displayed
      at the loss of a servant so faithful and so ruined, was a particular
      desire to lay hold of fifteen hundred pounds which the Cardinal was
      reported to have hidden somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinions concerning the divorce, of the learned doctors and bishops
      and others, being at last collected, and being generally in the King&rsquo;s
      favour, were forwarded to the Pope, with an entreaty that he would now
      grant it.&nbsp; The unfortunate Pope, who was a timid man, was half
      distracted between his fear of his authority being set aside in England if
      he did not do as he was asked, and his dread of offending the Emperor of
      Germany, who was Queen Catherine&rsquo;s nephew.&nbsp; In this state of
      mind he still evaded and did nothing.&nbsp; Then, <span class="smcap">Thomas
      Cromwell</span>, who had been one of Wolsey&rsquo;s faithful attendants,
      and had remained so even in his decline, advised the King to take the
      matter into his own hands, and make himself the head of the whole Church.&nbsp;
      This, the King by various artful means, began to do; but he recompensed
      the clergy by allowing them to burn as many people as they pleased, for
      holding Luther&rsquo;s opinions.&nbsp; You must understand that Sir Thomas
      More, the wise man who had helped the King with his book, had been made
      Chancellor in Wolsey&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; But, as he was truly attached to
      the Church as it was even in its abuses, he, in this state of things,
      resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being now quite resolved to get rid of Queen Catherine, and to marry Anne
      Boleyn without more ado, the King made Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury,
      and directed Queen Catherine to leave the Court.&nbsp; She obeyed; but
      replied that wherever she went, she was Queen of England still, and would
      remain so, to the last.&nbsp; The King then married Anne Boleyn privately;
      and the new Archbishop of Canterbury, within half a year, declared his
      marriage with Queen Catherine void, and crowned Anne Boleyn Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have known that no good could ever come from such wrong, and
      that the corpulent brute who had been so faithless and so cruel to his
      first wife, could be more faithless and more cruel to his second.&nbsp;
      She might have known that, even when he was in love with her, he had been
      a mean and selfish coward, running away, like a frightened cur, from her
      society and her house, when a dangerous sickness broke out in it, and when
      she might easily have taken it and died, as several of the household did.&nbsp;
      But, Anne Boleyn arrived at all this knowledge too late, and bought it at
      a dear price.&nbsp; Her bad marriage with a worse man came to its natural
      end.&nbsp; Its natural end was not, as we shall too soon see, a natural
      death for her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PART THE SECOND
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Pope was thrown into a very angry state of mind when he heard of the
      King&rsquo;s marriage, and fumed exceedingly.&nbsp; Many of the English
      monks and friars, seeing that their order was in danger, did the same;
      some even declaimed against the King in church before his face, and were
      not to be stopped until he himself roared out &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      The King, not much the worse for this, took it pretty quietly; and was
      very glad when his Queen gave birth to a daughter, who was christened
      <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, and declared Princess of Wales as
      her sister Mary had already been.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most atrocious features of this reign was that Henry the Eighth
      was always trimming between the reformed religion and the unreformed one;
      so that the more he quarrelled with the Pope, the more of his own subjects
      he roasted alive for not holding the Pope&rsquo;s opinions.&nbsp; Thus, an
      unfortunate student named John Frith, and a poor simple tailor named
      Andrew Hewet who loved him very much, and said that whatever John Frith
      believed <i>he</i> believed, were burnt in Smithfield&mdash;to show what a
      capital Christian the King was.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, these were speedily followed by two much greater victims, Sir Thomas
      More, and John Fisher, the Bishop of Rochester.&nbsp; The latter, who was
      a good and amiable old man, had committed no greater offence than
      believing in Elizabeth Barton, called the Maid of Kent&mdash;another of
      those ridiculous women who pretended to be inspired, and to make all sorts
      of heavenly revelations, though they indeed uttered nothing but evil
      nonsense.&nbsp; For this offence&mdash;as it was pretended, but really for
      denying the King to be the supreme Head of the Church&mdash;he got into
      trouble, and was put in prison; but, even then, he might have been
      suffered to die naturally (short work having been made of executing the
      Kentish Maid and her principal followers), but that the Pope, to spite the
      King, resolved to make him a cardinal.&nbsp; Upon that the King made a
      ferocious joke to the effect that the Pope might send Fisher a red hat&mdash;which
      is the way they make a cardinal&mdash;but he should have no head on which
      to wear it; and he was tried with all unfairness and injustice, and
      sentenced to death.&nbsp; He died like a noble and virtuous old man, and
      left a worthy name behind him.&nbsp; The King supposed, I dare say, that
      Sir Thomas More would be frightened by this example; but, as he was not to
      be easily terrified, and, thoroughly believing in the Pope, had made up
      his mind that the King was not the rightful Head of the Church, he
      positively refused to say that he was.&nbsp; For this crime he too was
      tried and sentenced, after having been in prison a whole year.&nbsp; When
      he was doomed to death, and came away from his trial with the edge of the
      executioner&rsquo;s axe turned towards him&mdash;as was always done in
      those times when a state prisoner came to that hopeless pass&mdash;he bore
      it quite serenely, and gave his blessing to his son, who pressed through
      the crowd in Westminster Hall and kneeled down to receive it.&nbsp; But,
      when he got to the Tower Wharf on his way back to his prison, and his
      favourite daughter, <span class="smcap">Margaret Roper</span>, a very good
      woman, rushed through the guards again and again, to kiss him and to weep
      upon his neck, he was overcome at last.&nbsp; He soon recovered, and never
      more showed any feeling but cheerfulness and courage.&nbsp; When he was
      going up the steps of the scaffold to his death, he said jokingly to the
      Lieutenant of the Tower, observing that they were weak and shook beneath
      his tread, &lsquo;I pray you, master Lieutenant, see me safe up; and, for
      my coming down, I can shift for myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Also he said to the
      executioner, after he had laid his head upon the block, &lsquo;Let me put
      my beard out of the way; for that, at least, has never committed any
      treason.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then his head was struck off at a blow.&nbsp; These
      two executions were worthy of King Henry the Eighth.&nbsp; Sir Thomas More
      was one of the most virtuous men in his dominions, and the Bishop was one
      of his oldest and truest friends.&nbsp; But to be a friend of that fellow
      was almost as dangerous as to be his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the news of these two murders got to Rome, the Pope raged against the
      murderer more than ever Pope raged since the world began, and prepared a
      Bull, ordering his subjects to take arms against him and dethrone him.&nbsp;
      The King took all possible precautions to keep that document out of his
      dominions, and set to work in return to suppress a great number of the
      English monasteries and abbeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      This destruction was begun by a body of commissioners, of whom Cromwell
      (whom the King had taken into great favour) was the head; and was carried
      on through some few years to its entire completion.&nbsp; There is no
      doubt that many of these religious establishments were religious in
      nothing but in name, and were crammed with lazy, indolent, and sensual
      monks.&nbsp; There is no doubt that they imposed upon the people in every
      possible way; that they had images moved by wires, which they pretended
      were miraculously moved by Heaven; that they had among them a whole tun
      measure full of teeth, all purporting to have come out of the head of one
      saint, who must indeed have been a very extraordinary person with that
      enormous allowance of grinders; that they had bits of coal which they said
      had fried Saint Lawrence, and bits of toe-nails which they said belonged
      to other famous saints; penknives, and boots, and girdles, which they said
      belonged to others; and that all these bits of rubbish were called Relics,
      and adored by the ignorant people.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, there is
      no doubt either, that the King&rsquo;s officers and men punished the good
      monks with the bad; did great injustice; demolished many beautiful things
      and many valuable libraries; destroyed numbers of paintings, stained glass
      windows, fine pavements, and carvings; and that the whole court were
      ravenously greedy and rapacious for the division of this great spoil among
      them.&nbsp; The King seems to have grown almost mad in the ardour of this
      pursuit; for he declared Thomas &agrave; Becket a traitor, though he had
      been dead so many years, and had his body dug up out of his grave.&nbsp;
      He must have been as miraculous as the monks pretended, if they had told
      the truth, for he was found with one head on his shoulders, and they had
      shown another as his undoubted and genuine head ever since his death; it
      had brought them vast sums of money, too.&nbsp; The gold and jewels on his
      shrine filled two great chests, and eight men tottered as they carried
      them away.&nbsp; How rich the monasteries were you may infer from the fact
      that, when they were all suppressed, one hundred and thirty thousand
      pounds a year&mdash;in those days an immense sum&mdash;came to the Crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things were not done without causing great discontent among the
      people.&nbsp; The monks had been good landlords and hospitable
      entertainers of all travellers, and had been accustomed to give away a
      great deal of corn, and fruit, and meat, and other things.&nbsp; In those
      days it was difficult to change goods into money, in consequence of the
      roads being very few and very bad, and the carts, and waggons of the worst
      description; and they must either have given away some of the good things
      they possessed in enormous quantities, or have suffered them to spoil and
      moulder.&nbsp; So, many of the people missed what it was more agreeable to
      get idly than to work for; and the monks who were driven out of their
      homes and wandered about encouraged their discontent; and there were,
      consequently, great risings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.&nbsp; These
      were put down by terrific executions, from which the monks themselves did
      not escape, and the King went on grunting and growling in his own fat way,
      like a Royal pig.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have told all this story of the religious houses at one time, to make it
      plainer, and to get back to the King&rsquo;s domestic affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Queen Catherine was by this time dead; and the King was by
      this time as tired of his second Queen as he had been of his first.&nbsp;
      As he had fallen in love with Anne when she was in the service of
      Catherine, so he now fell in love with another lady in the service of
      Anne.&nbsp; See how wicked deeds are punished, and how bitterly and
      self-reproachfully the Queen must now have thought of her own rise to the
      throne!&nbsp; The new fancy was a <span class="smcap">Lady Jane Seymour</span>;
      and the King no sooner set his mind on her, than he resolved to have Anne
      Boleyn&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; So, he brought a number of charges against
      Anne, accusing her of dreadful crimes which she had never committed, and
      implicating in them her own brother and certain gentlemen in her service:
      among whom one Norris, and Mark Smeaton a musician, are best remembered.&nbsp;
      As the lords and councillors were as afraid of the King and as subservient
      to him as the meanest peasant in England was, they brought in Anne Boleyn
      guilty, and the other unfortunate persons accused with her, guilty too.&nbsp;
      Those gentlemen died like men, with the exception of Smeaton, who had been
      tempted by the King into telling lies, which he called confessions, and
      who had expected to be pardoned; but who, I am very glad to say, was not.&nbsp;
      There was then only the Queen to dispose of.&nbsp; She had been surrounded
      in the Tower with women spies; had been monstrously persecuted and foully
      slandered; and had received no justice.&nbsp; But her spirit rose with her
      afflictions; and, after having in vain tried to soften the King by writing
      an affecting letter to him which still exists, &lsquo;from her doleful
      prison in the Tower,&rsquo; she resigned herself to death.&nbsp; She said
      to those about her, very cheerfully, that she had heard say the
      executioner was a good one, and that she had a little neck (she laughed
      and clasped it with her hands as she said that), and would soon be out of
      her pain.&nbsp; And she <i>was</i> soon out of her pain, poor creature, on
      the Green inside the Tower, and her body was flung into an old box and put
      away in the ground under the chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a story that the King sat in his palace listening very anxiously
      for the sound of the cannon which was to announce this new murder; and
      that, when he heard it come booming on the air, he rose up in great
      spirits and ordered out his dogs to go a-hunting.&nbsp; He was bad enough
      to do it; but whether he did it or not, it is certain that he married Jane
      Seymour the very next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not much pleasure in recording that she lived just long enough to
      give birth to a son who was christened <span class="smcap">Edward</span>,
      and then to die of a fever: for, I cannot but think that any woman who
      married such a ruffian, and knew what innocent blood was on his hands,
      deserved the axe that would assuredly have fallen on the neck of Jane
      Seymour, if she had lived much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranmer had done what he could to save some of the Church property for
      purposes of religion and education; but, the great families had been so
      hungry to get hold of it, that very little could be rescued for such
      objects.&nbsp; Even <span class="smcap">Miles Coverdale</span>, who did
      the people the inestimable service of translating the Bible into English
      (which the unreformed religion never permitted to be done), was left in
      poverty while the great families clutched the Church lands and money.&nbsp;
      The people had been told that when the Crown came into possession of these
      funds, it would not be necessary to tax them; but they were taxed afresh
      directly afterwards.&nbsp; It was fortunate for them, indeed, that so many
      nobles were so greedy for this wealth; since, if it had remained with the
      Crown, there might have been no end to tyranny for hundreds of years.&nbsp;
      One of the most active writers on the Church&rsquo;s side against the King
      was a member of his own family&mdash;a sort of distant cousin, <span
      class="smcap">Reginald Pole</span> by name&mdash;who attacked him in the
      most violent manner (though he received a pension from him all the time),
      and fought for the Church with his pen, day and night.&nbsp; As he was
      beyond the King&rsquo;s reach&mdash;being in Italy&mdash;the King politely
      invited him over to discuss the subject; but he, knowing better than to
      come, and wisely staying where he was, the King&rsquo;s rage fell upon his
      brother Lord Montague, the Marquis of Exeter, and some other gentlemen:
      who were tried for high treason in corresponding with him and aiding him&mdash;which
      they probably did&mdash;and were all executed.&nbsp; The Pope made
      Reginald Pole a cardinal; but, so much against his will, that it is
      thought he even aspired in his own mind to the vacant throne of England,
      and had hopes of marrying the Princess Mary.&nbsp; His being made a high
      priest, however, put an end to all that.&nbsp; His mother, the venerable
      Countess of Salisbury&mdash;who was, unfortunately for herself, within the
      tyrant&rsquo;s reach&mdash;was the last of his relatives on whom his wrath
      fell.&nbsp; When she was told to lay her grey head upon the block, she
      answered the executioner, &lsquo;No!&nbsp; My head never committed
      treason, and if you want it, you shall seize it.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, she ran
      round and round the scaffold with the executioner striking at her, and her
      grey hair bedabbled with blood; and even when they held her down upon the
      block she moved her head about to the last, resolved to be no party to her
      own barbarous murder.&nbsp; All this the people bore, as they had borne
      everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed they bore much more; for the slow fires of Smithfield were
      continually burning, and people were constantly being roasted to death&mdash;still
      to show what a good Christian the King was.&nbsp; He defied the Pope and
      his Bull, which was now issued, and had come into England; but he burned
      innumerable people whose only offence was that they differed from the Pope&rsquo;s
      religious opinions.&nbsp; There was a wretched man named <span
      class="smcap">Lambert</span>, among others, who was tried for this before
      the King, and with whom six bishops argued one after another.&nbsp; When
      he was quite exhausted (as well he might be, after six bishops), he threw
      himself on the King&rsquo;s mercy; but the King blustered out that he had
      no mercy for heretics.&nbsp; So, <i>he</i> too fed the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this the people bore, and more than all this yet.&nbsp; The national
      spirit seems to have been banished from the kingdom at this time.&nbsp;
      The very people who were executed for treason, the very wives and friends
      of the &lsquo;bluff&rsquo; King, spoke of him on the scaffold as a good
      prince, and a gentle prince&mdash;just as serfs in similar circumstances
      have been known to do, under the Sultan and Bashaws of the East, or under
      the fierce old tyrants of Russia, who poured boiling and freezing water on
      them alternately, until they died.&nbsp; The Parliament were as bad as the
      rest, and gave the King whatever he wanted; among other vile
      accommodations, they gave him new powers of murdering, at his will and
      pleasure, any one whom he might choose to call a traitor.&nbsp; But the
      worst measure they passed was an Act of Six Articles, commonly called at
      the time &lsquo;the whip with six strings;&rsquo; which punished offences
      against the Pope&rsquo;s opinions, without mercy, and enforced the very
      worst parts of the monkish religion.&nbsp; Cranmer would have modified it,
      if he could; but, being overborne by the Romish party, had not the power.&nbsp;
      As one of the articles declared that priests should not marry, and as he
      was married himself, he sent his wife and children into Germany, and began
      to tremble at his danger; none the less because he was, and had long been,
      the King&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; This whip of six strings was made under the
      King&rsquo;s own eye.&nbsp; It should never be forgotten of him how
      cruelly he supported the worst of the Popish doctrines when there was
      nothing to be got by opposing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This amiable monarch now thought of taking another wife.&nbsp; He proposed
      to the French King to have some of the ladies of the French Court
      exhibited before him, that he might make his Royal choice; but the French
      King answered that he would rather not have his ladies trotted out to be
      shown like horses at a fair.&nbsp; He proposed to the Dowager Duchess of
      Milan, who replied that she might have thought of such a match if she had
      had two heads; but, that only owning one, she must beg to keep it safe.&nbsp;
      At last Cromwell represented that there was a Protestant Princess in
      Germany&mdash;those who held the reformed religion were called
      Protestants, because their leaders had Protested against the abuses and
      impositions of the unreformed Church&mdash;named <span class="smcap">Anne
      of Cleves</span>, who was beautiful, and would answer the purpose
      admirably.&nbsp; The King said was she a large woman, because he must have
      a fat wife?&nbsp; &lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Cromwell; &lsquo;she was very
      large, just the thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; On hearing this the King sent over his
      famous painter, Hans Holbein, to take her portrait.&nbsp; Hans made her
      out to be so good-looking that the King was satisfied, and the marriage
      was arranged.&nbsp; But, whether anybody had paid Hans to touch up the
      picture; or whether Hans, like one or two other painters, flattered a
      princess in the ordinary way of business, I cannot say: all I know is,
      that when Anne came over and the King went to Rochester to meet her, and
      first saw her without her seeing him, he swore she was &lsquo;a great
      Flanders mare,&rsquo; and said he would never marry her.&nbsp; Being
      obliged to do it now matters had gone so far, he would not give her the
      presents he had prepared, and would never notice her.&nbsp; He never
      forgave Cromwell his part in the affair.&nbsp; His downfall dates from
      that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quickened by his enemies, in the interests of the unreformed
      religion, putting in the King&rsquo;s way, at a state dinner, a niece of
      the Duke of Norfolk, <span class="smcap">Catherine Howard</span>, a young
      lady of fascinating manners, though small in stature and not particularly
      beautiful.&nbsp; Falling in love with her on the spot, the King soon
      divorced Anne of Cleves after making her the subject of much brutal talk,
      on pretence that she had been previously betrothed to some one else&mdash;which
      would never do for one of his dignity&mdash;and married Catherine.&nbsp;
      It is probable that on his wedding day, of all days in the year, he sent
      his faithful Cromwell to the scaffold, and had his head struck off.&nbsp;
      He further celebrated the occasion by burning at one time, and causing to
      be drawn to the fire on the same hurdles, some Protestant prisoners for
      denying the Pope&rsquo;s doctrines, and some Roman Catholic prisoners for
      denying his own supremacy.&nbsp; Still the people bore it, and not a
      gentleman in England raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, by a just retribution, it soon came out that Catherine Howard, before
      her marriage, had been really guilty of such crimes as the King had
      falsely attributed to his second wife Anne Boleyn; so, again the dreadful
      axe made the King a widower, and this Queen passed away as so many in that
      reign had passed away before her.&nbsp; As an appropriate pursuit under
      the circumstances, Henry then applied himself to superintending the
      composition of a religious book called &lsquo;A necessary doctrine for any
      Christian Man.&rsquo;&nbsp; He must have been a little confused in his
      mind, I think, at about this period; for he was so false to himself as to
      be true to some one: that some one being Cranmer, whom the Duke of Norfolk
      and others of his enemies tried to ruin; but to whom the King was
      steadfast, and to whom he one night gave his ring, charging him when he
      should find himself, next day, accused of treason, to show it to the
      council board.&nbsp; This Cranmer did to the confusion of his enemies.&nbsp;
      I suppose the King thought he might want him a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He married yet once more.&nbsp; Yes, strange to say, he found in England
      another woman who would become his wife, and she was <span class="smcap">Catherine
      Parr</span>, widow of Lord Latimer.&nbsp; She leaned towards the reformed
      religion; and it is some comfort to know, that she tormented the King
      considerably by arguing a variety of doctrinal points with him on all
      possible occasions.&nbsp; She had very nearly done this to her own
      destruction.&nbsp; After one of these conversations the King in a very
      black mood actually instructed <span class="smcap">Gardiner</span>, one of
      his Bishops who favoured the Popish opinions, to draw a bill of accusation
      against her, which would have inevitably brought her to the scaffold where
      her predecessors had died, but that one of her friends picked up the paper
      of instructions which had been dropped in the palace, and gave her timely
      notice.&nbsp; She fell ill with terror; but managed the King so well when
      he came to entrap her into further statements&mdash;by saying that she had
      only spoken on such points to divert his mind and to get some information
      from his extraordinary wisdom&mdash;that he gave her a kiss and called her
      his sweetheart.&nbsp; And, when the Chancellor came next day actually to
      take her to the Tower, the King sent him about his business, and honoured
      him with the epithets of a beast, a knave, and a fool.&nbsp; So near was
      Catherine Parr to the block, and so narrow was her escape!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was war with Scotland in this reign, and a short clumsy war with
      France for favouring Scotland; but, the events at home were so dreadful,
      and leave such an enduring stain on the country, that I need say no more
      of what happened abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more horrors, and this reign is over.&nbsp; There was a lady, <span
      class="smcap">Anne Askew</span>, in Lincolnshire, who inclined to the
      Protestant opinions, and whose husband being a fierce Catholic, turned her
      out of his house.&nbsp; She came to London, and was considered as
      offending against the six articles, and was taken to the Tower, and put
      upon the rack&mdash;probably because it was hoped that she might, in her
      agony, criminate some obnoxious persons; if falsely, so much the better.&nbsp;
      She was tortured without uttering a cry, until the Lieutenant of the Tower
      would suffer his men to torture her no more; and then two priests who were
      present actually pulled off their robes, and turned the wheels of the rack
      with their own hands, so rending and twisting and breaking her that she
      was afterwards carried to the fire in a chair.&nbsp; She was burned with
      three others, a gentleman, a clergyman, and a tailor; and so the world
      went on.

      Either the King became afraid of the power of the Duke of Norfolk, and his
      son the Earl of Surrey, or they gave him some offence, but he resolved to
      pull <i>them</i> down, to follow all the rest who were gone.&nbsp; The son
      was tried first&mdash;of course for nothing&mdash;and defended himself
      bravely; but of course he was found guilty, and of course he was executed.&nbsp;
      Then his father was laid hold of, and left for death too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the King himself was left for death by a Greater King, and the earth
      was to be rid of him at last.&nbsp; He was now a swollen, hideous
      spectacle, with a great hole in his leg, and so odious to every sense that
      it was dreadful to approach him.&nbsp; When he was found to be dying,
      Cranmer was sent for from his palace at Croydon, and came with all speed,
      but found him speechless.&nbsp; Happily, in that hour he perished.&nbsp;
      He was in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and the thirty-eighth of his
      reign.

      Henry the Eighth has been favoured by some Protestant writers, because the
      Reformation was achieved in his time.&nbsp; But the mighty merit of it
      lies with other men and not with him; and it can be rendered none the
      worse by this monster&rsquo;s crimes, and none the better by any defence
      of them.&nbsp; The plain truth is, that he was a most intolerable ruffian,
      a disgrace to human nature, and a blot of blood and grease upon the
      History of England.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SIXTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Henry the Eighth had made a will, appointing a council of sixteen to
      govern the kingdom for his son while he was under age (he was now only ten
      years old), and another council of twelve to help them.&nbsp; The most
      powerful of the first council was the <span class="smcap">Earl of Hertford</span>,
      the young King&rsquo;s uncle, who lost no time in bringing his nephew with
      great state up to Enfield, and thence to the Tower.&nbsp; It was
      considered at the time a striking proof of virtue in the young King that
      he was sorry for his father&rsquo;s death; but, as common subjects have
      that virtue too, sometimes, we will say no more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious part of the late King&rsquo;s will, requiring his
      executors to fulfil whatever promises he had made.&nbsp; Some of the court
      wondering what these might be, the Earl of Hertford and the other noblemen
      interested, said that they were promises to advance and enrich <i>them</i>.&nbsp;
      So, the Earl of Hertford made himself <span class="smcap">Duke of Somerset</span>,
      and made his brother <span class="smcap">Edward Seymour</span> a baron;
      and there were various similar promotions, all very agreeable to the
      parties concerned, and very dutiful, no doubt, to the late King&rsquo;s
      memory.&nbsp; To be more dutiful still, they made themselves rich out of
      the Church lands, and were very comfortable.&nbsp; The new Duke of
      Somerset caused himself to be declared <span class="smcap">Protector</span>
      of the kingdom, and was, indeed, the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      As young Edward the Sixth had been brought up in the principles of the
      Protestant religion, everybody knew that they would be maintained.&nbsp;
      But Cranmer, to whom they were chiefly entrusted, advanced them steadily
      and temperately.&nbsp; Many superstitious and ridiculous practices were
      stopped; but practices which were harmless were not interfered with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Somerset, the Protector, was anxious to have the young King
      engaged in marriage to the young Queen of Scotland, in order to prevent
      that princess from making an alliance with any foreign power; but, as a
      large party in Scotland were unfavourable to this plan, he invaded that
      country.&nbsp; His excuse for doing so was, that the Border men&mdash;that
      is, the Scotch who lived in that part of the country where England and
      Scotland joined&mdash;troubled the English very much.&nbsp; But there were
      two sides to this question; for the English Border men troubled the Scotch
      too; and, through many long years, there were perpetual border quarrels
      which gave rise to numbers of old tales and songs.&nbsp; However, the
      Protector invaded Scotland; and <span class="smcap">Arran</span>, the
      Scottish Regent, with an army twice as large as his, advanced to meet him.&nbsp;
      They encountered on the banks of the river Esk, within a few miles of
      Edinburgh; and there, after a little skirmish, the Protector made such
      moderate proposals, in offering to retire if the Scotch would only engage
      not to marry their princess to any foreign prince, that the Regent thought
      the English were afraid.&nbsp; But in this he made a horrible mistake; for
      the English soldiers on land, and the English sailors on the water, so set
      upon the Scotch, that they broke and fled, and more than ten thousand of
      them were killed.&nbsp; It was a dreadful battle, for the fugitives were
      slain without mercy.&nbsp; The ground for four miles, all the way to
      Edinburgh, was strewn with dead men, and with arms, and legs, and heads.&nbsp;
      Some hid themselves in streams and were drowned; some threw away their
      armour and were killed running, almost naked; but in this battle of Pinkey
      the English lost only two or three hundred men.&nbsp; They were much
      better clothed than the Scotch; at the poverty of whose appearance and
      country they were exceedingly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Parliament was called when Somerset came back, and it repealed the whip
      with six strings, and did one or two other good things; though it
      unhappily retained the punishment of burning for those people who did not
      make believe to believe, in all religious matters, what the Government had
      declared that they must and should believe.&nbsp; It also made a foolish
      law (meant to put down beggars), that any man who lived idly and loitered
      about for three days together, should be burned with a hot iron, made a
      slave, and wear an iron fetter.&nbsp; But this savage absurdity soon came
      to an end, and went the way of a great many other foolish laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protector was now so proud that he sat in Parliament before all the
      nobles, on the right hand of the throne.&nbsp; Many other noblemen, who
      only wanted to be as proud if they could get a chance, became his enemies
      of course; and it is supposed that he came back suddenly from Scotland
      because he had received news that his brother, <span class="smcap">Lord
      Seymour</span>, was becoming dangerous to him.&nbsp; This lord was now
      High Admiral of England; a very handsome man, and a great favourite with
      the Court ladies&mdash;even with the young Princess Elizabeth, who romped
      with him a little more than young princesses in these times do with any
      one.&nbsp; He had married Catherine Parr, the late King&rsquo;s widow, who
      was now dead; and, to strengthen his power, he secretly supplied the young
      King with money.&nbsp; He may even have engaged with some of his brother&rsquo;s
      enemies in a plot to carry the boy off.&nbsp; On these and other
      accusations, at any rate, he was confined in the Tower, impeached, and
      found guilty; his own brother&rsquo;s name being&mdash;unnatural and sad
      to tell&mdash;the first signed to the warrant of his execution.&nbsp; He
      was executed on Tower Hill, and died denying his treason.&nbsp; One of his
      last proceedings in this world was to write two letters, one to the
      Princess Elizabeth, and one to the Princess Mary, which a servant of his
      took charge of, and concealed in his shoe.&nbsp; These letters are
      supposed to have urged them against his brother, and to revenge his death.&nbsp;
      What they truly contained is not known; but there is no doubt that he had,
      at one time, obtained great influence over the Princess Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while, the Protestant religion was making progress.&nbsp; The
      images which the people had gradually come to worship, were removed from
      the churches; the people were informed that they need not confess
      themselves to priests unless they chose; a common prayer-book was drawn up
      in the English language, which all could understand, and many other
      improvements were made; still moderately.&nbsp; For Cranmer was a very
      moderate man, and even restrained the Protestant clergy from violently
      abusing the unreformed religion&mdash;as they very often did, and which
      was not a good example.&nbsp; But the people were at this time in great
      distress.&nbsp; The rapacious nobility who had come into possession of the
      Church lands, were very bad landlords.&nbsp; They enclosed great
      quantities of ground for the feeding of sheep, which was then more
      profitable than the growing of crops; and this increased the general
      distress.&nbsp; So the people, who still understood little of what was
      going on about them, and still readily believed what the homeless monks
      told them&mdash;many of whom had been their good friends in their better
      days&mdash;took it into their heads that all this was owing to the
      reformed religion, and therefore rose, in many parts of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most powerful risings were in Devonshire and Norfolk.&nbsp; In
      Devonshire, the rebellion was so strong that ten thousand men united
      within a few days, and even laid siege to Exeter.&nbsp; But <span
      class="smcap">Lord Russell</span>, coming to the assistance of the
      citizens who defended that town, defeated the rebels; and, not only hanged
      the Mayor of one place, but hanged the vicar of another from his own
      church steeple.&nbsp; What with hanging and killing by the sword, four
      thousand of the rebels are supposed to have fallen in that one county.&nbsp;
      In Norfolk (where the rising was more against the enclosure of open lands
      than against the reformed religion), the popular leader was a man named
      <span class="smcap">Robert Ket</span>, a tanner of Wymondham.&nbsp; The
      mob were, in the first instance, excited against the tanner by one <span
      class="smcap">John Flowerdew</span>, a gentleman who owed him a grudge:
      but the tanner was more than a match for the gentleman, since he soon got
      the people on his side, and established himself near Norwich with quite an
      army.&nbsp; There was a large oak-tree in that place, on a spot called
      Moushold Hill, which Ket named the Tree of Reformation; and under its
      green boughs, he and his men sat, in the midsummer weather, holding courts
      of justice, and debating affairs of state.&nbsp; They were even impartial
      enough to allow some rather tiresome public speakers to get up into this
      Tree of Reformation, and point out their errors to them, in long
      discourses, while they lay listening (not always without some grumbling
      and growling) in the shade below.&nbsp; At last, one sunny July day, a
      herald appeared below the tree, and proclaimed Ket and all his men
      traitors, unless from that moment they dispersed and went home: in which
      case they were to receive a pardon.&nbsp; But, Ket and his men made light
      of the herald and became stronger than ever, until the Earl of Warwick
      went after them with a sufficient force, and cut them all to pieces.&nbsp;
      A few were hanged, drawn, and quartered, as traitors, and their limbs were
      sent into various country places to be a terror to the people.&nbsp; Nine
      of them were hanged upon nine green branches of the Oak of Reformation;
      and so, for the time, that tree may be said to have withered away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protector, though a haughty man, had compassion for the real
      distresses of the common people, and a sincere desire to help them.&nbsp;
      But he was too proud and too high in degree to hold even their favour
      steadily; and many of the nobles always envied and hated him, because they
      were as proud and not as high as he.&nbsp; He was at this time building a
      great Palace in the Strand: to get the stone for which he blew up church
      steeples with gunpowder, and pulled down bishops&rsquo; houses: thus
      making himself still more disliked.&nbsp; At length, his principal enemy,
      the Earl of Warwick&mdash;Dudley by name, and the son of that Dudley who
      had made himself so odious with Empson, in the reign of Henry the Seventh&mdash;joined
      with seven other members of the Council against him, formed a separate
      Council; and, becoming stronger in a few days, sent him to the Tower under
      twenty-nine articles of accusation.&nbsp; After being sentenced by the
      Council to the forfeiture of all his offices and lands, he was liberated
      and pardoned, on making a very humble submission.&nbsp; He was even taken
      back into the Council again, after having suffered this fall, and married
      his daughter, <span class="smcap">Lady Anne Seymour</span>, to Warwick&rsquo;s
      eldest son.&nbsp; But such a reconciliation was little likely to last, and
      did not outlive a year.&nbsp; Warwick, having got himself made Duke of
      Northumberland, and having advanced the more important of his friends,
      then finished the history by causing the Duke of Somerset and his friend
      <span class="smcap">Lord Grey</span>, and others, to be arrested for
      treason, in having conspired to seize and dethrone the King.&nbsp; They
      were also accused of having intended to seize the new Duke of
      Northumberland, with his friends <span class="smcap">Lord Northampton</span>
      and <span class="smcap">Lord Pembroke</span>; to murder them if they found
      need; and to raise the City to revolt.&nbsp; All this the fallen Protector
      positively denied; except that he confessed to having spoken of the murder
      of those three noblemen, but having never designed it.&nbsp; He was
      acquitted of the charge of treason, and found guilty of the other charges;
      so when the people&mdash;who remembered his having been their friend, now
      that he was disgraced and in danger, saw him come out from his trial with
      the axe turned from him&mdash;they thought he was altogether acquitted,
      and sent up a loud shout of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Duke of Somerset was ordered to be beheaded on Tower Hill, at
      eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and proclamations were issued bidding
      the citizens keep at home until after ten.&nbsp; They filled the streets,
      however, and crowded the place of execution as soon as it was light; and,
      with sad faces and sad hearts, saw the once powerful Protector ascend the
      scaffold to lay his head upon the dreadful block.&nbsp; While he was yet
      saying his last words to them with manly courage, and telling them, in
      particular, how it comforted him, at that pass, to have assisted in
      reforming the national religion, a member of the Council was seen riding
      up on horseback.&nbsp; They again thought that the Duke was saved by his
      bringing a reprieve, and again shouted for joy.&nbsp; But the Duke himself
      told them they were mistaken, and laid down his head and had it struck off
      at a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the bystanders rushed forward and steeped their handkerchiefs in
      his blood, as a mark of their affection.&nbsp; He had, indeed, been
      capable of many good acts, and one of them was discovered after he was no
      more.&nbsp; The Bishop of Durham, a very good man, had been informed
      against to the Council, when the Duke was in power, as having answered a
      treacherous letter proposing a rebellion against the reformed religion.&nbsp;
      As the answer could not be found, he could not be declared guilty; but it
      was now discovered, hidden by the Duke himself among some private papers,
      in his regard for that good man.&nbsp; The Bishop lost his office, and was
      deprived of his possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not very pleasant to know that while his uncle lay in prison under
      sentence of death, the young King was being vastly entertained by plays,
      and dances, and sham fights: but there is no doubt of it, for he kept a
      journal himself.&nbsp; It is pleasanter to know that not a single Roman
      Catholic was burnt in this reign for holding that religion; though two
      wretched victims suffered for heresy.&nbsp; One, a woman named <span
      class="smcap">Joan Bocher</span>, for professing some opinions that even
      she could only explain in unintelligible jargon.&nbsp; The other, a
      Dutchman, named <span class="smcap">Von Paris</span>, who practised as a
      surgeon in London.&nbsp; Edward was, to his credit, exceedingly unwilling
      to sign the warrant for the woman&rsquo;s execution: shedding tears before
      he did so, and telling Cranmer, who urged him to do it (though Cranmer
      really would have spared the woman at first, but for her own determined
      obstinacy), that the guilt was not his, but that of the man who so
      strongly urged the dreadful act.&nbsp; We shall see, too soon, whether the
      time ever came when Cranmer is likely to have remembered this with sorrow
      and remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranmer and <span class="smcap">Ridley</span> (at first Bishop of
      Rochester, and afterwards Bishop of London) were the most powerful of the
      clergy of this reign.&nbsp; Others were imprisoned and deprived of their
      property for still adhering to the unreformed religion; the most important
      among whom were <span class="smcap">Gardiner</span> Bishop of Winchester,
      <span class="smcap">Heath</span> Bishop of Worcester, <span class="smcap">Day</span>
      Bishop of Chichester, and <span class="smcap">Bonner</span> that Bishop of
      London who was superseded by Ridley.&nbsp; The Princess Mary, who
      inherited her mother&rsquo;s gloomy temper, and hated the reformed
      religion as connected with her mother&rsquo;s wrongs and sorrows&mdash;she
      knew nothing else about it, always refusing to read a single book in which
      it was truly described&mdash;held by the unreformed religion too, and was
      the only person in the kingdom for whom the old Mass was allowed to be
      performed; nor would the young King have made that exception even in her
      favour, but for the strong persuasions of Cranmer and Ridley.&nbsp; He
      always viewed it with horror; and when he fell into a sickly condition,
      after having been very ill, first of the measles and then of the
      small-pox, he was greatly troubled in mind to think that if he died, and
      she, the next heir to the throne, succeeded, the Roman Catholic religion
      would be set up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This uneasiness, the Duke of Northumberland was not slow to encourage:
      for, if the Princess Mary came to the throne, he, who had taken part with
      the Protestants, was sure to be disgraced.&nbsp; Now, the Duchess of
      Suffolk was descended from King Henry the Seventh; and, if she resigned
      what little or no right she had, in favour of her daughter <span
      class="smcap">Lady Jane Grey</span>, that would be the succession to
      promote the Duke&rsquo;s greatness; because <span class="smcap">Lord
      Guilford Dudley</span>, one of his sons, was, at this very time, newly
      married to her.&nbsp; So, he worked upon the King&rsquo;s fears, and
      persuaded him to set aside both the Princess Mary and the Princess
      Elizabeth, and assert his right to appoint his successor.&nbsp;
      Accordingly the young King handed to the Crown lawyers a writing signed
      half a dozen times over by himself, appointing Lady Jane Grey to succeed
      to the Crown, and requiring them to have his will made out according to
      law.&nbsp; They were much against it at first, and told the King so; but
      the Duke of Northumberland&mdash;being so violent about it that the
      lawyers even expected him to beat them, and hotly declaring that, stripped
      to his shirt, he would fight any man in such a quarrel&mdash;they yielded.&nbsp;
      Cranmer, also, at first hesitated; pleading that he had sworn to maintain
      the succession of the Crown to the Princess Mary; but, he was a weak man
      in his resolutions, and afterwards signed the document with the rest of
      the council.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was completed none too soon; for Edward was now sinking in a rapid
      decline; and, by way of making him better, they handed him over to a
      woman-doctor who pretended to be able to cure it.&nbsp; He speedily got
      worse.&nbsp; On the sixth of July, in the year one thousand five hundred
      and fifty-three, he died, very peaceably and piously, praying God, with
      his last breath, to protect the reformed religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This King died in the sixteenth year of his age, and in the seventh of his
      reign.&nbsp; It is difficult to judge what the character of one so young
      might afterwards have become among so many bad, ambitious, quarrelling
      nobles.&nbsp; But, he was an amiable boy, of very good abilities, and had
      nothing coarse or cruel or brutal in his disposition&mdash;which in the
      son of such a father is rather surprising.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER MARY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Duke of Northumberland was very anxious to keep the young King&rsquo;s
      death a secret, in order that he might get the two Princesses into his
      power.&nbsp; But, the Princess Mary, being informed of that event as she
      was on her way to London to see her sick brother, turned her horse&rsquo;s
      head, and rode away into Norfolk.&nbsp; The Earl of Arundel was her
      friend, and it was he who sent her warning of what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the secret could not be kept, the Duke of Northumberland and the
      council sent for the Lord Mayor of London and some of the aldermen, and
      made a merit of telling it to them.&nbsp; Then, they made it known to the
      people, and set off to inform Lady Jane Grey that she was to be Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a pretty girl of only sixteen, and was amiable, learned, and
      clever.&nbsp; When the lords who came to her, fell on their knees before
      her, and told her what tidings they brought, she was so astonished that
      she fainted.&nbsp; On recovering, she expressed her sorrow for the young
      King&rsquo;s death, and said that she knew she was unfit to govern the
      kingdom; but that if she must be Queen, she prayed God to direct her.&nbsp;
      She was then at Sion House, near Brentford; and the lords took her down
      the river in state to the Tower, that she might remain there (as the
      custom was) until she was crowned.&nbsp; But the people were not at all
      favourable to Lady Jane, considering that the right to be Queen was Mary&rsquo;s,
      and greatly disliking the Duke of Northumberland.&nbsp; They were not put
      into a better humour by the Duke&rsquo;s causing a vintner&rsquo;s
      servant, one Gabriel Pot, to be taken up for expressing his
      dissatisfaction among the crowd, and to have his ears nailed to the
      pillory, and cut off.&nbsp; Some powerful men among the nobility declared
      on Mary&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; They raised troops to support her cause, had
      her proclaimed Queen at Norwich, and gathered around her at the castle of
      Framlingham, which belonged to the Duke of Norfolk.&nbsp; For, she was not
      considered so safe as yet, but that it was best to keep her in a castle on
      the sea-coast, from whence she might be sent abroad, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council would have despatched Lady Jane&rsquo;s father, the Duke of
      Suffolk, as the general of the army against this force; but, as Lady Jane
      implored that her father might remain with her, and as he was known to be
      but a weak man, they told the Duke of Northumberland that he must take the
      command himself.&nbsp; He was not very ready to do so, as he mistrusted
      the Council much; but there was no help for it, and he set forth with a
      heavy heart, observing to a lord who rode beside him through Shoreditch at
      the head of the troops, that, although the people pressed in great numbers
      to look at them, they were terribly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his fears for himself turned out to be well founded.&nbsp; While he
      was waiting at Cambridge for further help from the Council, the Council
      took it into their heads to turn their backs on Lady Jane&rsquo;s cause,
      and to take up the Princess Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This was chiefly owing to
      the before-mentioned Earl of Arundel, who represented to the Lord Mayor
      and aldermen, in a second interview with those sagacious persons, that, as
      for himself, he did not perceive the Reformed religion to be in much
      danger&mdash;which Lord Pembroke backed by flourishing his sword as
      another kind of persuasion.&nbsp; The Lord Mayor and aldermen, thus
      enlightened, said there could be no doubt that the Princess Mary ought to
      be Queen.&nbsp; So, she was proclaimed at the Cross by St. Paul&rsquo;s,
      and barrels of wine were given to the people, and they got very drunk, and
      danced round blazing bonfires&mdash;little thinking, poor wretches, what
      other bonfires would soon be blazing in Queen Mary&rsquo;s name.

      After a ten days&rsquo; dream of royalty, Lady Jane Grey resigned the
      Crown with great willingness, saying that she had only accepted it in
      obedience to her father and mother; and went gladly back to her pleasant
      house by the river, and her books.&nbsp; Mary then came on towards London;
      and at Wanstead in Essex, was joined by her half-sister, the Princess
      Elizabeth.&nbsp; They passed through the streets of London to the Tower,
      and there the new Queen met some eminent prisoners then confined in it,
      kissed them, and gave them their liberty.&nbsp; Among these was that
      Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, who had been imprisoned in the last reign
      for holding to the unreformed religion.&nbsp; Him she soon made
      chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Northumberland had been taken prisoner, and, together with his
      son and five others, was quickly brought before the Council.&nbsp; He, not
      unnaturally, asked that Council, in his defence, whether it was treason to
      obey orders that had been issued under the great seal; and, if it were,
      whether they, who had obeyed them too, ought to be his judges?&nbsp; But
      they made light of these points; and, being resolved to have him out of
      the way, soon sentenced him to death.&nbsp; He had risen into power upon
      the death of another man, and made but a poor show (as might be expected)
      when he himself lay low.&nbsp; He entreated Gardiner to let him live, if
      it were only in a mouse&rsquo;s hole; and, when he ascended the scaffold
      to be beheaded on Tower Hill, addressed the people in a miserable way,
      saying that he had been incited by others, and exhorting them to return to
      the unreformed religion, which he told them was his faith.&nbsp; There
      seems reason to suppose that he expected a pardon even then, in return for
      this confession; but it matters little whether he did or not.&nbsp; His
      head was struck off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was now crowned Queen.&nbsp; She was thirty-seven years of age, short
      and thin, wrinkled in the face, and very unhealthy.&nbsp; But she had a
      great liking for show and for bright colours, and all the ladies of her
      Court were magnificently dressed.&nbsp; She had a great liking too for old
      customs, without much sense in them; and she was oiled in the oldest way,
      and blessed in the oldest way, and done all manner of things to in the
      oldest way, at her coronation.&nbsp; I hope they did her good.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon began to show her desire to put down the Reformed religion, and
      put up the unreformed one: though it was dangerous work as yet, the people
      being something wiser than they used to be.&nbsp; They even cast a shower
      of stones&mdash;and among them a dagger&mdash;at one of the royal
      chaplains who attacked the Reformed religion in a public sermon.&nbsp; But
      the Queen and her priests went steadily on.&nbsp; Ridley, the powerful
      bishop of the last reign, was seized and sent to the Tower.&nbsp; <span
      class="smcap">Latimer</span>, also celebrated among the Clergy of the last
      reign, was likewise sent to the Tower, and Cranmer speedily followed.&nbsp;
      Latimer was an aged man; and, as his guards took him through Smithfield,
      he looked round it, and said, &lsquo;This is a place that hath long
      groaned for me.&rsquo;&nbsp; For he knew well, what kind of bonfires would
      soon be burning.&nbsp; Nor was the knowledge confined to him.&nbsp; The
      prisons were fast filled with the chief Protestants, who were there left
      rotting in darkness, hunger, dirt, and separation from their friends;
      many, who had time left them for escape, fled from the kingdom; and the
      dullest of the people began, now, to see what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came on fast.&nbsp; A Parliament was got together; not without strong
      suspicion of unfairness; and they annulled the divorce, formerly
      pronounced by Cranmer between the Queen&rsquo;s mother and King Henry the
      Eighth, and unmade all the laws on the subject of religion that had been
      made in the last King Edward&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; They began their
      proceedings, in violation of the law, by having the old mass said before
      them in Latin, and by turning out a bishop who would not kneel down.&nbsp;
      They also declared guilty of treason, Lady Jane Grey for aspiring to the
      Crown; her husband, for being her husband; and Cranmer, for not believing
      in the mass aforesaid.&nbsp; They then prayed the Queen graciously to
      choose a husband for herself, as soon as might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the question who should be the Queen&rsquo;s husband had given rise
      to a great deal of discussion, and to several contending parties.&nbsp;
      Some said Cardinal Pole was the man&mdash;but the Queen was of opinion
      that he was <i>not</i> the man, he being too old and too much of a
      student.&nbsp; Others said that the gallant young <span class="smcap">Courtenay</span>,
      whom the Queen had made Earl of Devonshire, was the man&mdash;and the
      Queen thought so too, for a while; but she changed her mind.&nbsp; At last
      it appeared that <span class="smcap">Philip</span>, <span class="smcap">Prince
      of Spain</span>, was certainly the man&mdash;though certainly not the
      people&rsquo;s man; for they detested the idea of such a marriage from the
      beginning to the end, and murmured that the Spaniard would establish in
      England, by the aid of foreign soldiers, the worst abuses of the Popish
      religion, and even the terrible Inquisition itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      These discontents gave rise to a conspiracy for marrying young Courtenay
      to the Princess Elizabeth, and setting them up, with popular tumults all
      over the kingdom, against the Queen.&nbsp; This was discovered in time by
      Gardiner; but in Kent, the old bold county, the people rose in their old
      bold way.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Wyat</span>, a man of great
      daring, was their leader.&nbsp; He raised his standard at Maidstone,
      marched on to Rochester, established himself in the old castle there, and
      prepared to hold out against the Duke of Norfolk, who came against him
      with a party of the Queen&rsquo;s guards, and a body of five hundred
      London men.&nbsp; The London men, however, were all for Elizabeth, and not
      at all for Mary.&nbsp; They declared, under the castle walls, for Wyat;
      the Duke retreated; and Wyat came on to Deptford, at the head of fifteen
      thousand men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these, in their turn, fell away.&nbsp; When he came to Southwark,
      there were only two thousand left.&nbsp; Not dismayed by finding the
      London citizens in arms, and the guns at the Tower ready to oppose his
      crossing the river there, Wyat led them off to Kingston-upon-Thames,
      intending to cross the bridge that he knew to be in that place, and so to
      work his way round to Ludgate, one of the old gates of the City.&nbsp; He
      found the bridge broken down, but mended it, came across, and bravely
      fought his way up Fleet Street to Ludgate Hill.&nbsp; Finding the gate
      closed against him, he fought his way back again, sword in hand, to Temple
      Bar.&nbsp; Here, being overpowered, he surrendered himself, and three or
      four hundred of his men were taken, besides a hundred killed.&nbsp; Wyat,
      in a moment of weakness (and perhaps of torture) was afterwards made to
      accuse the Princess Elizabeth as his accomplice to some very small extent.&nbsp;
      But his manhood soon returned to him, and he refused to save his life by
      making any more false confessions.&nbsp; He was quartered and distributed
      in the usual brutal way, and from fifty to a hundred of his followers were
      hanged.&nbsp; The rest were led out, with halters round their necks, to be
      pardoned, and to make a parade of crying out, &lsquo;God save Queen Mary!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the danger of this rebellion, the Queen showed herself to be a woman of
      courage and spirit.&nbsp; She disdained to retreat to any place of safety,
      and went down to the Guildhall, sceptre in hand, and made a gallant speech
      to the Lord Mayor and citizens.&nbsp; But on the day after Wyat&rsquo;s
      defeat, she did the most cruel act, even of her cruel reign, in signing
      the warrant for the execution of Lady Jane Grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tried to persuade Lady Jane to accept the unreformed religion; but
      she steadily refused.&nbsp; On the morning when she was to die, she saw
      from her window the bleeding and headless body of her husband brought back
      in a cart from the scaffold on Tower Hill where he had laid down his life.&nbsp;
      But, as she had declined to see him before his execution, lest she should
      be overpowered and not make a good end, so, she even now showed a
      constancy and calmness that will never be forgotten.&nbsp; She came up to
      the scaffold with a firm step and a quiet face, and addressed the
      bystanders in a steady voice.&nbsp; They were not numerous; for she was
      too young, too innocent and fair, to be murdered before the people on
      Tower Hill, as her husband had just been; so, the place of her execution
      was within the Tower itself.&nbsp; She said that she had done an unlawful
      act in taking what was Queen Mary&rsquo;s right; but that she had done so
      with no bad intent, and that she died a humble Christian.&nbsp; She begged
      the executioner to despatch her quickly, and she asked him, &lsquo;Will
      you take my head off before I lay me down?&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered,
      &lsquo;No, Madam,&rsquo; and then she was very quiet while they bandaged
      her eyes.&nbsp; Being blinded, and unable to see the block on which she
      was to lay her young head, she was seen to feel about for it with her
      hands, and was heard to say, confused, &lsquo;O what shall I do!&nbsp;
      Where is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then they guided her to the right place, and the
      executioner struck off her head.&nbsp; You know too well, now, what
      dreadful deeds the executioner did in England, through many, many years,
      and how his axe descended on the hateful block through the necks of some
      of the bravest, wisest, and best in the land.&nbsp; But it never struck so
      cruel and so vile a blow as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father of Lady Jane soon followed, but was little pitied.&nbsp; Queen
      Mary&rsquo;s next object was to lay hold of Elizabeth, and this was
      pursued with great eagerness.&nbsp; Five hundred men were sent to her
      retired house at Ashridge, by Berkhampstead, with orders to bring her up,
      alive or dead.&nbsp; They got there at ten at night, when she was sick in
      bed.&nbsp; But, their leaders followed her lady into her bedchamber,
      whence she was brought out betimes next morning, and put into a litter to
      be conveyed to London.&nbsp; She was so weak and ill, that she was five
      days on the road; still, she was so resolved to be seen by the people that
      she had the curtains of the litter opened; and so, very pale and sickly,
      passed through the streets.&nbsp; She wrote to her sister, saying she was
      innocent of any crime, and asking why she was made a prisoner; but she got
      no answer, and was ordered to the Tower.&nbsp; They took her in by the
      Traitor&rsquo;s Gate, to which she objected, but in vain.&nbsp; One of the
      lords who conveyed her offered to cover her with his cloak, as it was
      raining, but she put it away from her, proudly and scornfully, and passed
      into the Tower, and sat down in a court-yard on a stone.&nbsp; They
      besought her to come in out of the wet; but she answered that it was
      better sitting there, than in a worse place.&nbsp; At length she went to
      her apartment, where she was kept a prisoner, though not so close a
      prisoner as at Woodstock, whither she was afterwards removed, and where
      she is said to have one day envied a milkmaid whom she heard singing in
      the sunshine as she went through the green fields.&nbsp; Gardiner, than
      whom there were not many worse men among the fierce and sullen priests,
      cared little to keep secret his stern desire for her death: being used to
      say that it was of little service to shake off the leaves, and lop the
      branches of the tree of heresy, if its root, the hope of heretics, were
      left.&nbsp; He failed, however, in his benevolent design.&nbsp; Elizabeth
      was, at length, released; and Hatfield House was assigned to her as a
      residence, under the care of one <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Pope</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem that Philip, the Prince of Spain, was a main cause of this
      change in Elizabeth&rsquo;s fortunes.&nbsp; He was not an amiable man,
      being, on the contrary, proud, overbearing, and gloomy; but he and the
      Spanish lords who came over with him, assuredly did discountenance the
      idea of doing any violence to the Princess.&nbsp; It may have been mere
      prudence, but we will hope it was manhood and honour.&nbsp; The Queen had
      been expecting her husband with great impatience, and at length he came,
      to her great joy, though he never cared much for her.&nbsp; They were
      married by Gardiner, at Winchester, and there was more holiday-making
      among the people; but they had their old distrust of this Spanish
      marriage, in which even the Parliament shared.&nbsp; Though the members of
      that Parliament were far from honest, and were strongly suspected to have
      been bought with Spanish money, they would pass no bill to enable the
      Queen to set aside the Princess Elizabeth and appoint her own successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Gardiner failed in this object, as well as in the darker one of
      bringing the Princess to the scaffold, he went on at a great pace in the
      revival of the unreformed religion.&nbsp; A new Parliament was packed, in
      which there were no Protestants.&nbsp; Preparations were made to receive
      Cardinal Pole in England as the Pope&rsquo;s messenger, bringing his holy
      declaration that all the nobility who had acquired Church property, should
      keep it&mdash;which was done to enlist their selfish interest on the Pope&rsquo;s
      side.&nbsp; Then a great scene was enacted, which was the triumph of the
      Queen&rsquo;s plans.&nbsp; Cardinal Pole arrived in great splendour and
      dignity, and was received with great pomp.&nbsp; The Parliament joined in
      a petition expressive of their sorrow at the change in the national
      religion, and praying him to receive the country again into the Popish
      Church.&nbsp; With the Queen sitting on her throne, and the King on one
      side of her, and the Cardinal on the other, and the Parliament present,
      Gardiner read the petition aloud.&nbsp; The Cardinal then made a great
      speech, and was so obliging as to say that all was forgotten and forgiven,
      and that the kingdom was solemnly made Roman Catholic again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was now ready for the lighting of the terrible bonfires.&nbsp;
      The Queen having declared to the Council, in writing, that she would wish
      none of her subjects to be burnt without some of the Council being
      present, and that she would particularly wish there to be good sermons at
      all burnings, the Council knew pretty well what was to be done next.&nbsp;
      So, after the Cardinal had blessed all the bishops as a preface to the
      burnings, the Chancellor Gardiner opened a High Court at Saint Mary Overy,
      on the Southwark side of London Bridge, for the trial of heretics.&nbsp;
      Here, two of the late Protestant clergymen, <span class="smcap">Hooper</span>,
      Bishop of Gloucester, and <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>, a Prebendary
      of St. Paul&rsquo;s, were brought to be tried.&nbsp; Hooper was tried
      first for being married, though a priest, and for not believing in the
      mass.&nbsp; He admitted both of these accusations, and said that the mass
      was a wicked imposition.&nbsp; Then they tried Rogers, who said the same.&nbsp;
      Next morning the two were brought up to be sentenced; and then Rogers said
      that his poor wife, being a German woman and a stranger in the land, he
      hoped might be allowed to come to speak to him before he died.&nbsp; To
      this the inhuman Gardiner replied, that she was not his wife.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;Yea, but she is, my lord,&rsquo; said Rogers, &lsquo;and she hath
      been my wife these eighteen years.&rsquo;&nbsp; His request was still
      refused, and they were both sent to Newgate; all those who stood in the
      streets to sell things, being ordered to put out their lights that the
      people might not see them.&nbsp; But, the people stood at their doors with
      candles in their hands, and prayed for them as they went by.&nbsp; Soon
      afterwards, Rogers was taken out of jail to be burnt in Smithfield; and,
      in the crowd as he went along, he saw his poor wife and his ten children,
      of whom the youngest was a little baby.&nbsp; And so he was burnt to
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, Hooper, who was to be burnt at Gloucester, was brought out
      to take his last journey, and was made to wear a hood over his face that
      he might not be known by the people.&nbsp; But, they did know him for all
      that, down in his own part of the country; and, when he came near
      Gloucester, they lined the road, making prayers and lamentations.&nbsp;
      His guards took him to a lodging, where he slept soundly all night.&nbsp;
      At nine o&rsquo;clock next morning, he was brought forth leaning on a
      staff; for he had taken cold in prison, and was infirm.&nbsp; The iron
      stake, and the iron chain which was to bind him to it, were fixed up near
      a great elm-tree in a pleasant open place before the cathedral, where, on
      peaceful Sundays, he had been accustomed to preach and to pray, when he
      was bishop of Gloucester.&nbsp; This tree, which had no leaves then, it
      being February, was filled with people; and the priests of Gloucester
      College were looking complacently on from a window, and there was a great
      concourse of spectators in every spot from which a glimpse of the dreadful
      sight could be beheld.&nbsp; When the old man kneeled down on the small
      platform at the foot of the stake, and prayed aloud, the nearest people
      were observed to be so attentive to his prayers that they were ordered to
      stand farther back; for it did not suit the Romish Church to have those
      Protestant words heard.&nbsp; His prayers concluded, he went up to the
      stake and was stripped to his shirt, and chained ready for the fire.&nbsp;
      One of his guards had such compassion on him that, to shorten his agonies,
      he tied some packets of gunpowder about him.&nbsp; Then they heaped up
      wood and straw and reeds, and set them all alight.&nbsp; But, unhappily,
      the wood was green and damp, and there was a wind blowing that blew what
      flame there was, away.&nbsp; Thus, through three-quarters of an hour, the
      good old man was scorched and roasted and smoked, as the fire rose and
      sank; and all that time they saw him, as he burned, moving his lips in
      prayer, and beating his breast with one hand, even after the other was
      burnt away and had fallen off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, were taken to Oxford to dispute with a
      commission of priests and doctors about the mass.&nbsp; They were
      shamefully treated; and it is recorded that the Oxford scholars hissed and
      howled and groaned, and misconducted themselves in an anything but a
      scholarly way.&nbsp; The prisoners were taken back to jail, and afterwards
      tried in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; They were all found guilty.&nbsp;
      On the sixteenth of the month of October, Ridley and Latimer were brought
      out, to make another of the dreadful bonfires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene of the suffering of these two good Protestant men was in the
      City ditch, near Baliol College.&nbsp; On coming to the dreadful spot,
      they kissed the stakes, and then embraced each other.&nbsp; And then a
      learned doctor got up into a pulpit which was placed there, and preached a
      sermon from the text, &lsquo;Though I give my body to be burned, and have
      not charity, it profiteth me nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; When you think of the
      charity of burning men alive, you may imagine that this learned doctor had
      a rather brazen face.&nbsp; Ridley would have answered his sermon when it
      came to an end, but was not allowed.&nbsp; When Latimer was stripped, it
      appeared that he had dressed himself under his other clothes, in a new
      shroud; and, as he stood in it before all the people, it was noted of him,
      and long remembered, that, whereas he had been stooping and feeble but a
      few minutes before, he now stood upright and handsome, in the knowledge
      that he was dying for a just and a great cause.&nbsp; Ridley&rsquo;s
      brother-in-law was there with bags of gunpowder; and when they were both
      chained up, he tied them round their bodies.&nbsp; Then, a light was
      thrown upon the pile to fire it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be of good comfort, Master
      Ridley,&rsquo; said Latimer, at that awful moment, &lsquo;and play the
      man!&nbsp; We shall this day light such a candle, by God&rsquo;s grace, in
      England, as I trust shall never be put out.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he was
      seen to make motions with his hands as if he were washing them in the
      flames, and to stroke his aged face with them, and was heard to cry,
      &lsquo;Father of Heaven, receive my soul!&rsquo;&nbsp; He died quickly,
      but the fire, after having burned the legs of Ridley, sunk.&nbsp; There he
      lingered, chained to the iron post, and crying, &lsquo;O!&nbsp; I cannot
      burn!&nbsp; O! for Christ&rsquo;s sake let the fire come unto me!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      And still, when his brother-in-law had heaped on more wood, he was heard
      through the blinding smoke, still dismally crying, &lsquo;O!&nbsp; I
      cannot burn, I cannot burn!&rsquo;&nbsp; At last, the gunpowder caught
      fire, and ended his miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days after this fearful scene, Gardiner went to his tremendous
      account before God, for the cruelties he had so much assisted in
      committing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranmer remained still alive and in prison.&nbsp; He was brought out again
      in February, for more examining and trying, by Bonner, Bishop of London:
      another man of blood, who had succeeded to Gardiner&rsquo;s work, even in
      his lifetime, when Gardiner was tired of it.&nbsp; Cranmer was now
      degraded as a priest, and left for death; but, if the Queen hated any one
      on earth, she hated him, and it was resolved that he should be ruined and
      disgraced to the utmost.&nbsp; There is no doubt that the Queen and her
      husband personally urged on these deeds, because they wrote to the
      Council, urging them to be active in the kindling of the fearful fires.&nbsp;
      As Cranmer was known not to be a firm man, a plan was laid for surrounding
      him with artful people, and inducing him to recant to the unreformed
      religion.&nbsp; Deans and friars visited him, played at bowls with him,
      showed him various attentions, talked persuasively with him, gave him
      money for his prison comforts, and induced him to sign, I fear, as many as
      six recantations.&nbsp; But when, after all, he was taken out to be burnt,
      he was nobly true to his better self, and made a glorious end.
    </p>
    <p>
      After prayers and a sermon, Dr. Cole, the preacher of the day (who had
      been one of the artful priests about Cranmer in prison), required him to
      make a public confession of his faith before the people.&nbsp; This, Cole
      did, expecting that he would declare himself a Roman Catholic.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;I will make a profession of my faith,&rsquo; said Cranmer, &lsquo;and
      with a good will too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, he arose before them all, and took from the sleeve of his robe a
      written prayer and read it aloud.&nbsp; That done, he kneeled and said the
      Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, all the people joining; and then he arose again and
      told them that he believed in the Bible, and that in what he had lately
      written, he had written what was not the truth, and that, because his
      right hand had signed those papers, he would burn his right hand first
      when he came to the fire.&nbsp; As for the Pope, he did refuse him and
      denounce him as the enemy of Heaven.&nbsp; Hereupon the pious Dr. Cole
      cried out to the guards to stop that heretic&rsquo;s mouth and take him
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they took him away, and chained him to the stake, where he hastily took
      off his own clothes to make ready for the flames.&nbsp; And he stood
      before the people with a bald head and a white and flowing beard.&nbsp; He
      was so firm now when the worst was come, that he again declared against
      his recantation, and was so impressive and so undismayed, that a certain
      lord, who was one of the directors of the execution, called out to the men
      to make haste!&nbsp; When the fire was lighted, Cranmer, true to his
      latest word, stretched out his right hand, and crying out, &lsquo;This
      hand hath offended!&rsquo; held it among the flames, until it blazed and
      burned away.&nbsp; His heart was found entire among his ashes, and he left
      at last a memorable name in English history.&nbsp; Cardinal Pole
      celebrated the day by saying his first mass, and next day he was made
      Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer&rsquo;s place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen&rsquo;s husband, who was now mostly abroad in his own dominions,
      and generally made a coarse jest of her to his more familiar courtiers,
      was at war with France, and came over to seek the assistance of England.&nbsp;
      England was very unwilling to engage in a French war for his sake; but it
      happened that the King of France, at this very time, aided a descent upon
      the English coast.&nbsp; Hence, war was declared, greatly to Philip&rsquo;s
      satisfaction; and the Queen raised a sum of money with which to carry it
      on, by every unjustifiable means in her power.&nbsp; It met with no
      profitable return, for the French Duke of Guise surprised Calais, and the
      English sustained a complete defeat.&nbsp; The losses they met with in
      France greatly mortified the national pride, and the Queen never recovered
      the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bad fever raging in England at this time, and I am glad to
      write that the Queen took it, and the hour of her death came.&nbsp;
      &lsquo;When I am dead and my body is opened,&rsquo; she said to those
      around those around her, &lsquo;ye shall find <span class="smcap">Calais</span>
      written on my heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should have thought, if anything were
      written on it, they would have found the words&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jane
      Grey</span>, <span class="smcap">Hooper</span>, <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>,
      <span class="smcap">Ridley</span>, <span class="smcap">Latimer</span>,
      <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>, <span class="smcap">and three hundred
      people burnt alive within four years of my wicked reign</span>, <span
      class="smcap">including sixty women and forty little children</span>.&nbsp;
      But it is enough that their deaths were written in Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen died on the seventeenth of November, fifteen hundred and
      fifty-eight, after reigning not quite five years and a half, and in the
      forty-fourth year of her age.&nbsp; Cardinal Pole died of the same fever
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As <span class="smcap">Bloody Queen Mary</span>, this woman has become
      famous, and as <span class="smcap">Bloody Queen Mary</span>, she will ever
      be justly remembered with horror and detestation in Great Britain.&nbsp;
      Her memory has been held in such abhorrence that some writers have arisen
      in later years to take her part, and to show that she was, upon the whole,
      quite an amiable and cheerful sovereign!&nbsp; &lsquo;By their fruits ye
      shall know them,&rsquo; said <span class="smcap">Our Saviour</span>.&nbsp;
      The stake and the fire were the fruits of this reign, and you will judge
      this Queen by nothing else.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was great rejoicing all over the land when the Lords of the Council
      went down to Hatfield, to hail the Princess Elizabeth as the new Queen of
      England.&nbsp; Weary of the barbarities of Mary&rsquo;s reign, the people
      looked with hope and gladness to the new Sovereign.&nbsp; The nation
      seemed to wake from a horrible dream; and Heaven, so long hidden by the
      smoke of the fires that roasted men and women to death, appeared to
      brighten once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Elizabeth was five-and-twenty years of age when she rode through the
      streets of London, from the Tower to Westminster Abbey, to be crowned.&nbsp;
      Her countenance was strongly marked, but on the whole, commanding and
      dignified; her hair was red, and her nose something too long and sharp for
      a woman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She was not the beautiful creature her courtiers
      made out; but she was well enough, and no doubt looked all the better for
      coming after the dark and gloomy Mary.&nbsp; She was well educated, but a
      roundabout writer, and rather a hard swearer and coarse talker.&nbsp; She
      was clever, but cunning and deceitful, and inherited much of her father&rsquo;s
      violent temper.&nbsp; I mention this now, because she has been so
      over-praised by one party, and so over-abused by another, that it is
      hardly possible to understand the greater part of her reign without first
      understanding what kind of woman she really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began her reign with the great advantage of having a very wise and
      careful Minister, <span class="smcap">Sir William Cecil</span>, whom she
      afterwards made <span class="smcap">Lord Burleigh</span>.&nbsp;
      Altogether, the people had greater reason for rejoicing than they usually
      had, when there were processions in the streets; and they were happy with
      some reason.&nbsp; All kinds of shows and images were set up; <span
      class="smcap">Gog</span> and <span class="smcap">Magog</span> were hoisted
      to the top of Temple Bar, and (which was more to the purpose) the
      Corporation dutifully presented the young Queen with the sum of a thousand
      marks in gold&mdash;so heavy a present, that she was obliged to take it
      into her carriage with both hands.&nbsp; The coronation was a great
      success; and, on the next day, one of the courtiers presented a petition
      to the new Queen, praying that as it was the custom to release some
      prisoners on such occasions, she would have the goodness to release the
      four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and also the Apostle
      Saint Paul, who had been for some time shut up in a strange language so
      that the people could not get at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this, the Queen replied that it would be better first to inquire of
      themselves whether they desired to be released or not; and, as a means of
      finding out, a great public discussion&mdash;a sort of religious
      tournament&mdash;was appointed to take place between certain champions of
      the two religions, in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; You may suppose that it was
      soon made pretty clear to common sense, that for people to benefit by what
      they repeat or read, it is rather necessary they should understand
      something about it.&nbsp; Accordingly, a Church Service in plain English
      was settled, and other laws and regulations were made, completely
      establishing the great work of the Reformation.&nbsp; The Romish bishops
      and champions were not harshly dealt with, all things considered; and the
      Queen&rsquo;s Ministers were both prudent and merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one great trouble of this reign, and the unfortunate cause of the
      greater part of such turmoil and bloodshed as occurred in it, was <span
      class="smcap">Mary Stuart</span>, <span class="smcap">Queen of Scots</span>.&nbsp;
      We will try to understand, in as few words as possible, who Mary was, what
      she was, and how she came to be a thorn in the royal pillow of Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the daughter of the Queen Regent of Scotland, <span class="smcap">Mary
      of Guise</span>.&nbsp; She had been married, when a mere child, to the
      Dauphin, the son and heir of the King of France.&nbsp; The Pope, who
      pretended that no one could rightfully wear the crown of England without
      his gracious permission, was strongly opposed to Elizabeth, who had not
      asked for the said gracious permission.&nbsp; And as Mary Queen of Scots
      would have inherited the English crown in right of her birth, supposing
      the English Parliament not to have altered the succession, the Pope
      himself, and most of the discontented who were followers of his,
      maintained that Mary was the rightful Queen of England, and Elizabeth the
      wrongful Queen.&nbsp; Mary being so closely connected with France, and
      France being jealous of England, there was far greater danger in this than
      there would have been if she had had no alliance with that great power.&nbsp;
      And when her young husband, on the death of his father, became <span
      class="smcap">Francis the Second</span>, King of France, the matter grew
      very serious.&nbsp; For, the young couple styled themselves King and Queen
      of England, and the Pope was disposed to help them by doing all the
      mischief he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the reformed religion, under the guidance of a stern and powerful
      preacher, named <span class="smcap">John Knox</span>, and other such men,
      had been making fierce progress in Scotland.&nbsp; It was still a half
      savage country, where there was a great deal of murdering and rioting
      continually going on; and the Reformers, instead of reforming those evils
      as they should have done, went to work in the ferocious old Scottish
      spirit, laying churches and chapels waste, pulling down pictures and
      altars, and knocking about the Grey Friars, and the Black Friars, and the
      White Friars, and the friars of all sorts of colours, in all directions.&nbsp;
      This obdurate and harsh spirit of the Scottish Reformers (the Scotch have
      always been rather a sullen and frowning people in religious matters) put
      up the blood of the Romish French court, and caused France to send troops
      over to Scotland, with the hope of setting the friars of all sorts of
      colours on their legs again; of conquering that country first, and England
      afterwards; and so crushing the Reformation all to pieces.&nbsp; The
      Scottish Reformers, who had formed a great league which they called The
      Congregation of the Lord, secretly represented to Elizabeth that, if the
      reformed religion got the worst of it with them, it would be likely to get
      the worst of it in England too; and thus, Elizabeth, though she had a high
      notion of the rights of Kings and Queens to do anything they liked, sent
      an army to Scotland to support the Reformers, who were in arms against
      their sovereign.&nbsp; All these proceedings led to a treaty of peace at
      Edinburgh, under which the French consented to depart from the kingdom.&nbsp;
      By a separate treaty, Mary and her young husband engaged to renounce their
      assumed title of King and Queen of England.&nbsp; But this treaty they
      never fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, soon after matters had got to this state, that the young
      French King died, leaving Mary a young widow.&nbsp; She was then invited
      by her Scottish subjects to return home and reign over them; and as she
      was not now happy where she was, she, after a little time, complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth had been Queen three years, when Mary Queen of Scots embarked at
      Calais for her own rough, quarrelling country.&nbsp; As she came out of
      the harbour, a vessel was lost before her eyes, and she said, &lsquo;O!
      good God! what an omen this is for such a voyage!&rsquo;&nbsp; She was
      very fond of France, and sat on the deck, looking back at it and weeping,
      until it was quite dark.&nbsp; When she went to bed, she directed to be
      called at daybreak, if the French coast were still visible, that she might
      behold it for the last time.&nbsp; As it proved to be a clear morning,
      this was done, and she again wept for the country she was leaving, and
      said many times, &lsquo;Farewell, France!&nbsp; Farewell, France!&nbsp; I
      shall never see thee again!&rsquo;&nbsp; All this was long remembered
      afterwards, as sorrowful and interesting in a fair young princess of
      nineteen.&nbsp; Indeed, I am afraid it gradually came, together with her
      other distresses, to surround her with greater sympathy than she deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came to Scotland, and took up her abode at the palace of Holyrood
      in Edinburgh, she found herself among uncouth strangers and wild
      uncomfortable customs very different from her experiences in the court of
      France.&nbsp; The very people who were disposed to love her, made her head
      ache when she was tired out by her voyage, with a serenade of discordant
      music&mdash;a fearful concert of bagpipes, I suppose&mdash;and brought her
      and her train home to her palace on miserable little Scotch horses that
      appeared to be half starved.&nbsp; Among the people who were not disposed
      to love her, she found the powerful leaders of the Reformed Church, who
      were bitter upon her amusements, however innocent, and denounced music and
      dancing as works of the devil.&nbsp; John Knox himself often lectured her,
      violently and angrily, and did much to make her life unhappy.&nbsp; All
      these reasons confirmed her old attachment to the Romish religion, and
      caused her, there is no doubt, most imprudently and dangerously both for
      herself and for England too, to give a solemn pledge to the heads of the
      Romish Church that if she ever succeeded to the English crown, she would
      set up that religion again.&nbsp; In reading her unhappy history, you must
      always remember this; and also that during her whole life she was
      constantly put forward against the Queen, in some form or other, by the
      Romish party.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Elizabeth, on the other hand, was not inclined to like her, is pretty
      certain.&nbsp; Elizabeth was very vain and jealous, and had an
      extraordinary dislike to people being married.&nbsp; She treated Lady
      Catherine Grey, sister of the beheaded Lady Jane, with such shameful
      severity, for no other reason than her being secretly married, that she
      died and her husband was ruined; so, when a second marriage for Mary began
      to be talked about, probably Elizabeth disliked her more.&nbsp; Not that
      Elizabeth wanted suitors of her own, for they started up from Spain,
      Austria, Sweden, and England.&nbsp; Her English lover at this time, and
      one whom she much favoured too, was <span class="smcap">Lord Robert Dudley</span>,
      Earl of Leicester&mdash;himself secretly married to <span class="smcap">Amy
      Robsart</span>, the daughter of an English gentleman, whom he was strongly
      suspected of causing to be murdered, down at his country seat, Cumnor Hall
      in Berkshire, that he might be free to marry the Queen.&nbsp; Upon this
      story, the great writer, <span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott</span>, has
      founded one of his best romances.&nbsp; But if Elizabeth knew how to lead
      her handsome favourite on, for her own vanity and pleasure, she knew how
      to stop him for her own pride; and his love, and all the other proposals,
      came to nothing.&nbsp; The Queen always declared in good set speeches,
      that she would never be married at all, but would live and die a Maiden
      Queen.&nbsp; It was a very pleasant and meritorious declaration, I
      suppose; but it has been puffed and trumpeted so much, that I am rather
      tired of it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divers princes proposed to marry Mary, but the English court had reasons
      for being jealous of them all, and even proposed as a matter of policy
      that she should marry that very Earl of Leicester who had aspired to be
      the husband of Elizabeth.&nbsp; At last, <span class="smcap">Lord Darnley</span>,
      son of the Earl of Lennox, and himself descended from the Royal Family of
      Scotland, went over with Elizabeth&rsquo;s consent to try his fortune at
      Holyrood.&nbsp; He was a tall simpleton; and could dance and play the
      guitar; but I know of nothing else he could do, unless it were to get very
      drunk, and eat gluttonously, and make a contemptible spectacle of himself
      in many mean and vain ways.&nbsp; However, he gained Mary&rsquo;s heart,
      not disdaining in the pursuit of his object to ally himself with one of
      her secretaries, <span class="smcap">David Rizzio</span>, who had great
      influence with her.&nbsp; He soon married the Queen.&nbsp; This marriage
      does not say much for her, but what followed will presently say less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s brother, the <span class="smcap">Earl of Murray</span>, and
      head of the Protestant party in Scotland, had opposed this marriage,
      partly on religious grounds, and partly perhaps from personal dislike of
      the very contemptible bridegroom.&nbsp; When it had taken place, through
      Mary&rsquo;s gaining over to it the more powerful of the lords about her,
      she banished Murray for his pains; and, when he and some other nobles rose
      in arms to support the reformed religion, she herself, within a month of
      her wedding day, rode against them in armour with loaded pistols in her
      saddle.&nbsp; Driven out of Scotland, they presented themselves before
      Elizabeth&mdash;who called them traitors in public, and assisted them in
      private, according to her crafty nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had been married but a little while, when she began to hate her
      husband, who, in his turn, began to hate that David Rizzio, with whom he
      had leagued to gain her favour, and whom he now believed to be her lover.&nbsp;
      He hated Rizzio to that extent, that he made a compact with <span
      class="smcap">Lord Ruthven</span> and three other lords to get rid of him
      by murder.&nbsp; This wicked agreement they made in solemn secrecy upon
      the first of March, fifteen hundred and sixty-six, and on the night of
      Saturday the ninth, the conspirators were brought by Darnley up a private
      staircase, dark and steep, into a range of rooms where they knew that Mary
      was sitting at supper with her sister, Lady Argyle, and this doomed man.&nbsp;
      When they went into the room, Darnley took the Queen round the waist, and
      Lord Ruthven, who had risen from a bed of sickness to do this murder, came
      in, gaunt and ghastly, leaning on two men.&nbsp; Rizzio ran behind the
      Queen for shelter and protection.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let him come out of the
      room,&rsquo; said Ruthven.&nbsp; &lsquo;He shall not leave the room,&rsquo;
      replied the Queen; &lsquo;I read his danger in your face, and it is my
      will that he remain here.&rsquo;&nbsp; They then set upon him, struggled
      with him, overturned the table, dragged him out, and killed him with
      fifty-six stabs.&nbsp; When the Queen heard that he was dead, she said,
      &lsquo;No more tears.&nbsp; I will think now of revenge!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a day or two, she gained her husband over, and prevailed on the
      tall idiot to abandon the conspirators and fly with her to Dunbar.&nbsp;
      There, he issued a proclamation, audaciously and falsely denying that he
      had any knowledge of the late bloody business; and there they were joined
      by the <span class="smcap">Earl Bothwell</span> and some other nobles.&nbsp;
      With their help, they raised eight thousand men; returned to Edinburgh,
      and drove the assassins into England.&nbsp; Mary soon afterwards gave
      birth to a son&mdash;still thinking of revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she should have had a greater scorn for her husband after his late
      cowardice and treachery than she had had before, was natural enough.&nbsp;
      There is little doubt that she now began to love Bothwell instead, and to
      plan with him means of getting rid of Darnley.&nbsp; Bothwell had such
      power over her that he induced her even to pardon the assassins of Rizzio.&nbsp;
      The arrangements for the Christening of the young Prince were entrusted to
      him, and he was one of the most important people at the ceremony, where
      the child was named <span class="smcap">James</span>: Elizabeth being his
      godmother, though not present on the occasion.&nbsp; A week afterwards,
      Darnley, who had left Mary and gone to his father&rsquo;s house at
      Glasgow, being taken ill with the small-pox, she sent her own physician to
      attend him.&nbsp; But there is reason to apprehend that this was merely a
      show and a pretence, and that she knew what was doing, when Bothwell
      within another month proposed to one of the late conspirators against
      Rizzio, to murder Darnley, &lsquo;for that it was the Queen&rsquo;s mind
      that he should be taken away.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is certain that on that very
      day she wrote to her ambassador in France, complaining of him, and yet
      went immediately to Glasgow, feigning to be very anxious about him, and to
      love him very much.&nbsp; If she wanted to get him in her power, she
      succeeded to her heart&rsquo;s content; for she induced him to go back
      with her to Edinburgh, and to occupy, instead of the palace, a lone house
      outside the city called the Kirk of Field.&nbsp; Here, he lived for about
      a week.&nbsp; One Sunday night, she remained with him until ten o&rsquo;clock,
      and then left him, to go to Holyrood to be present at an entertainment
      given in celebration of the marriage of one of her favourite servants.&nbsp;
      At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning the city was shaken by a great
      explosion, and the Kirk of Field was blown to atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darnley&rsquo;s body was found next day lying under a tree at some
      distance.&nbsp; How it came there, undisfigured and unscorched by
      gunpowder, and how this crime came to be so clumsily and strangely
      committed, it is impossible to discover.&nbsp; The deceitful character of
      Mary, and the deceitful character of Elizabeth, have rendered almost every
      part of their joint history uncertain and obscure.&nbsp; But, I fear that
      Mary was unquestionably a party to her husband&rsquo;s murder, and that
      this was the revenge she had threatened.&nbsp; The Scotch people
      universally believed it.&nbsp; Voices cried out in the streets of
      Edinburgh in the dead of the night, for justice on the murderess.&nbsp;
      Placards were posted by unknown hands in the public places denouncing
      Bothwell as the murderer, and the Queen as his accomplice; and, when he
      afterwards married her (though himself already married), previously making
      a show of taking her prisoner by force, the indignation of the people knew
      no bounds.&nbsp; The women particularly are described as having been quite
      frantic against the Queen, and to have hooted and cried after her in the
      streets with terrific vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such guilty unions seldom prosper.&nbsp; This husband and wife had lived
      together but a month, when they were separated for ever by the successes
      of a band of Scotch nobles who associated against them for the protection
      of the young Prince: whom Bothwell had vainly endeavoured to lay hold of,
      and whom he would certainly have murdered, if the <span class="smcap">Earl
      of Mar</span>, in whose hands the boy was, had not been firmly and
      honourably faithful to his trust.&nbsp; Before this angry power, Bothwell
      fled abroad, where he died, a prisoner and mad, nine miserable years
      afterwards.&nbsp; Mary being found by the associated lords to deceive them
      at every turn, was sent a prisoner to Lochleven Castle; which, as it stood
      in the midst of a lake, could only be approached by boat.&nbsp; Here, one
      <span class="smcap">Lord Lindsay</span>, who was so much of a brute that
      the nobles would have done better if they had chosen a mere gentleman for
      their messenger, made her sign her abdication, and appoint Murray, Regent
      of Scotland.&nbsp; Here, too, Murray saw her in a sorrowing and humbled
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had better have remained in the castle of Lochleven, dull prison as it
      was, with the rippling of the lake against it, and the moving shadows of
      the water on the room walls; but she could not rest there, and more than
      once tried to escape.&nbsp; The first time she had nearly succeeded,
      dressed in the clothes of her own washer-woman, but, putting up her hand
      to prevent one of the boatmen from lifting her veil, the men suspected
      her, seeing how white it was, and rowed her back again.&nbsp; A short time
      afterwards, her fascinating manners enlisted in her cause a boy in the
      Castle, called the little <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, who, while
      the family were at supper, stole the keys of the great gate, went softly
      out with the Queen, locked the gate on the outside, and rowed her away
      across the lake, sinking the keys as they went along.&nbsp; On the
      opposite shore she was met by another Douglas, and some few lords; and, so
      accompanied, rode away on horseback to Hamilton, where they raised three
      thousand men.&nbsp; Here, she issued a proclamation declaring that the
      abdication she had signed in her prison was illegal, and requiring the
      Regent to yield to his lawful Queen.&nbsp; Being a steady soldier, and in
      no way discomposed although he was without an army, Murray pretended to
      treat with her, until he had collected a force about half equal to her
      own, and then he gave her battle.&nbsp; In one quarter of an hour he cut
      down all her hopes.&nbsp; She had another weary ride on horse-back of
      sixty long Scotch miles, and took shelter at Dundrennan Abbey, whence she
      fled for safety to Elizabeth&rsquo;s dominions.

    <p>
      Mary Queen of Scots came to England&mdash;to her own ruin, the trouble of
      the kingdom, and the misery and death of many&mdash;in the year one
      thousand five hundred and sixty-eight.&nbsp; How she left it and the
      world, nineteen years afterwards, we have now to see.
    </p>
    <h3>
      SECOND PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Mary Queen of Scots arrived in England, without money and even
      without any other clothes than those she wore, she wrote to Elizabeth,
      representing herself as an innocent and injured piece of Royalty, and
      entreating her assistance to oblige her Scottish subjects to take her back
      again and obey her.&nbsp; But, as her character was already known in
      England to be a very different one from what she made it out to be, she
      was told in answer that she must first clear herself.&nbsp; Made uneasy by
      this condition, Mary, rather than stay in England, would have gone to
      Spain, or to France, or would even have gone back to Scotland.&nbsp; But,
      as her doing either would have been likely to trouble England afresh, it
      was decided that she should be detained here.&nbsp; She first came to
      Carlisle, and, after that, was moved about from castle to castle, as was
      considered necessary; but England she never left again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After trying very hard to get rid of the necessity of clearing herself,
      Mary, advised by <span class="smcap">Lord Herries</span>, her best friend
      in England, agreed to answer the charges against her, if the Scottish
      noblemen who made them would attend to maintain them before such English
      noblemen as Elizabeth might appoint for that purpose.&nbsp; Accordingly,
      such an assembly, under the name of a conference, met, first at York, and
      afterwards at Hampton Court.&nbsp; In its presence Lord Lennox, Darnley&rsquo;s
      father, openly charged Mary with the murder of his son; and whatever Mary&rsquo;s
      friends may now say or write in her behalf, there is no doubt that, when
      her brother Murray produced against her a casket containing certain guilty
      letters and verses which he stated to have passed between her and
      Bothwell, she withdrew from the inquiry.&nbsp; Consequently, it is to be
      supposed that she was then considered guilty by those who had the best
      opportunities of judging of the truth, and that the feeling which
      afterwards arose in her behalf was a very generous but not a very
      reasonable one.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the <span class="smcap">Duke of Norfolk</span>, an honourable but
      rather weak nobleman, partly because Mary was captivating, partly because
      he was ambitious, partly because he was over-persuaded by artful plotters
      against Elizabeth, conceived a strong idea that he would like to marry the
      Queen of Scots&mdash;though he was a little frightened, too, by the
      letters in the casket.&nbsp; This idea being secretly encouraged by some
      of the noblemen of Elizabeth&rsquo;s court, and even by the favourite Earl
      of Leicester (because it was objected to by other favourites who were his
      rivals), Mary expressed her approval of it, and the King of France and the
      King of Spain are supposed to have done the same.&nbsp; It was not so
      quietly planned, though, but that it came to Elizabeth&rsquo;s ears, who
      warned the Duke &lsquo;to be careful what sort of pillow he was going to
      lay his head upon.&rsquo;&nbsp; He made a humble reply at the time; but
      turned sulky soon afterwards, and, being considered dangerous, was sent to
      the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, from the moment of Mary&rsquo;s coming to England she began to be
      the centre of plots and miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rise of the Catholics in the north was the next of these, and it was
      only checked by many executions and much bloodshed.&nbsp; It was followed
      by a great conspiracy of the Pope and some of the Catholic sovereigns of
      Europe to depose Elizabeth, place Mary on the throne, and restore the
      unreformed religion.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to doubt that Mary knew
      and approved of this; and the Pope himself was so hot in the matter that
      he issued a bull, in which he openly called Elizabeth the &lsquo;pretended
      Queen&rsquo; of England, excommunicated her, and excommunicated all her
      subjects who should continue to obey her.&nbsp; A copy of this miserable
      paper got into London, and was found one morning publicly posted on the
      Bishop of London&rsquo;s gate.&nbsp; A great hue and cry being raised,
      another copy was found in the chamber of a student of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn,
      who confessed, being put upon the rack, that he had received it from one
      <span class="smcap">John Felton</span>, a rich gentleman who lived across
      the Thames, near Southwark.&nbsp; This John Felton, being put upon the
      rack too, confessed that he had posted the placard on the Bishop&rsquo;s
      gate.&nbsp; For this offence he was, within four days, taken to St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Churchyard, and there hanged and quartered.&nbsp; As to the Pope&rsquo;s
      bull, the people by the reformation having thrown off the Pope, did not
      care much, you may suppose, for the Pope&rsquo;s throwing off them.&nbsp;
      It was a mere dirty piece of paper, and not half so powerful as a street
      ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very day when Felton was brought to his trial, the poor Duke of
      Norfolk was released.&nbsp; It would have been well for him if he had kept
      away from the Tower evermore, and from the snares that had taken him
      there.&nbsp; But, even while he was in that dismal place he corresponded
      with Mary, and as soon as he was out of it, he began to plot again.&nbsp;
      Being discovered in correspondence with the Pope, with a view to a rising
      in England which should force Elizabeth to consent to his marriage with
      Mary and to repeal the laws against the Catholics, he was re-committed to
      the Tower and brought to trial.&nbsp; He was found guilty by the unanimous
      verdict of the Lords who tried him, and was sentenced to the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very difficult to make out, at this distance of time, and between
      opposite accounts, whether Elizabeth really was a humane woman, or desired
      to appear so, or was fearful of shedding the blood of people of great name
      who were popular in the country.&nbsp; Twice she commanded and
      countermanded the execution of this Duke, and it did not take place until
      five months after his trial.&nbsp; The scaffold was erected on Tower Hill,
      and there he died like a brave man.&nbsp; He refused to have his eyes
      bandaged, saying that he was not at all afraid of death; and he admitted
      the justice of his sentence, and was much regretted by the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mary had shrunk at the most important time from disproving her
      guilt, she was very careful never to do anything that would admit it.&nbsp;
      All such proposals as were made to her by Elizabeth for her release,
      required that admission in some form or other, and therefore came to
      nothing.&nbsp; Moreover, both women being artful and treacherous, and
      neither ever trusting the other, it was not likely that they could ever
      make an agreement.&nbsp; So, the Parliament, aggravated by what the Pope
      had done, made new and strong laws against the spreading of the Catholic
      religion in England, and declared it treason in any one to say that the
      Queen and her successors were not the lawful sovereigns of England.&nbsp;
      It would have done more than this, but for Elizabeth&rsquo;s moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Reformation, there had come to be three great sects of religious
      people&mdash;or people who called themselves so&mdash;in England; that is
      to say, those who belonged to the Reformed Church, those who belonged to
      the Unreformed Church, and those who were called the Puritans, because
      they said that they wanted to have everything very pure and plain in all
      the Church service.&nbsp; These last were for the most part an
      uncomfortable people, who thought it highly meritorious to dress in a
      hideous manner, talk through their noses, and oppose all harmless
      enjoyments.&nbsp; But they were powerful too, and very much in earnest,
      and they were one and all the determined enemies of the Queen of Scots.&nbsp;
      The Protestant feeling in England was further strengthened by the
      tremendous cruelties to which Protestants were exposed in France and in
      the Netherlands.&nbsp; Scores of thousands of them were put to death in
      those countries with every cruelty that can be imagined, and at last, in
      the autumn of the year one thousand five hundred and seventy-two, one of
      the greatest barbarities ever committed in the world took place at Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is called in history, <span class="smcap">The Massacre of Saint
      Bartholomew</span>, because it took place on Saint Bartholomew&rsquo;s
      Eve.&nbsp; The day fell on Saturday the twenty-third of August.&nbsp; On
      that day all the great leaders of the Protestants (who were there called
      <span class="smcap">Huguenots</span>) were assembled together, for the
      purpose, as was represented to them, of doing honour to the marriage of
      their chief, the young King of Navarre, with the sister of <span
      class="smcap">Charles the Ninth</span>: a miserable young King who then
      occupied the French throne.&nbsp; This dull creature was made to believe
      by his mother and other fierce Catholics about him that the Huguenots
      meant to take his life; and he was persuaded to give secret orders that,
      on the tolling of a great bell, they should be fallen upon by an
      overpowering force of armed men, and slaughtered wherever they could be
      found.&nbsp; When the appointed hour was close at hand, the stupid wretch,
      trembling from head to foot, was taken into a balcony by his mother to see
      the atrocious work begun.&nbsp; The moment the bell tolled, the murderers
      broke forth.&nbsp; During all that night and the two next days, they broke
      into the houses, fired the houses, shot and stabbed the Protestants, men,
      women, and children, and flung their bodies into the streets.&nbsp; They
      were shot at in the streets as they passed along, and their blood ran down
      the gutters.&nbsp; Upwards of ten thousand Protestants were killed in
      Paris alone; in all France four or five times that number.&nbsp; To return
      thanks to Heaven for these diabolical murders, the Pope and his train
      actually went in public procession at Rome, and as if this were not shame
      enough for them, they had a medal struck to commemorate the event.&nbsp;
      But, however comfortable the wholesale murders were to these high
      authorities, they had not that soothing effect upon the doll-King.&nbsp; I
      am happy to state that he never knew a moment&rsquo;s peace afterwards;
      that he was continually crying out that he saw the Huguenots covered with
      blood and wounds falling dead before him; and that he died within a year,
      shrieking and yelling and raving to that degree, that if all the Popes who
      had ever lived had been rolled into one, they would not have afforded His
      guilty Majesty the slightest consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the terrible news of the massacre arrived in England, it made a
      powerful impression indeed upon the people.&nbsp; If they began to run a
      little wild against the Catholics at about this time, this fearful reason
      for it, coming so soon after the days of bloody Queen Mary, must be
      remembered in their excuse.&nbsp; The Court was not quite so honest as the
      people&mdash;but perhaps it sometimes is not.&nbsp; It received the French
      ambassador, with all the lords and ladies dressed in deep mourning, and
      keeping a profound silence.&nbsp; Nevertheless, a proposal of marriage
      which he had made to Elizabeth only two days before the eve of Saint
      Bartholomew, on behalf of the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, the French King&rsquo;s
      brother, a boy of seventeen, still went on; while on the other hand, in
      her usual crafty way, the Queen secretly supplied the Huguenots with money
      and weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must say that for a Queen who made all those fine speeches, of which I
      have confessed myself to be rather tired, about living and dying a Maiden
      Queen, Elizabeth was &lsquo;going&rsquo; to be married pretty often.&nbsp;
      Besides always having some English favourite or other whom she by turns
      encouraged and swore at and knocked about&mdash;for the maiden Queen was
      very free with her fists&mdash;she held this French Duke off and on
      through several years.&nbsp; When he at last came over to England, the
      marriage articles were actually drawn up, and it was settled that the
      wedding should take place in six weeks.&nbsp; The Queen was then so bent
      upon it, that she prosecuted a poor Puritan named <span class="smcap">Stubbs</span>,
      and a poor bookseller named <span class="smcap">Page</span>, for writing
      and publishing a pamphlet against it.&nbsp; Their right hands were chopped
      off for this crime; and poor Stubbs&mdash;more loyal than I should have
      been myself under the circumstances&mdash;immediately pulled off his hat
      with his left hand, and cried, &lsquo;God save the Queen!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      Stubbs was cruelly treated; for the marriage never took place after all,
      though the Queen pledged herself to the Duke with a ring from her own
      finger.&nbsp; He went away, no better than he came, when the courtship had
      lasted some ten years altogether; and he died a couple of years
      afterwards, mourned by Elizabeth, who appears to have been really fond of
      him.&nbsp; It is not much to her credit, for he was a bad enough member of
      a bad family.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to the Catholics.&nbsp; There arose two orders of priests, who
      were very busy in England, and who were much dreaded.&nbsp; These were the
      <span class="smcap">Jesuits</span> (who were everywhere in all sorts of
      disguises), and the <span class="smcap">Seminary Priests</span>.&nbsp; The
      people had a great horror of the first, because they were known to have
      taught that murder was lawful if it were done with an object of which they
      approved; and they had a great horror of the second, because they came to
      teach the old religion, and to be the successors of &lsquo;Queen Mary&rsquo;s
      priests,&rsquo; as those yet lingering in England were called, when they
      should die out.&nbsp; The severest laws were made against them, and were
      most unmercifully executed.&nbsp; Those who sheltered them in their houses
      often suffered heavily for what was an act of humanity; and the rack, that
      cruel torture which tore men&rsquo;s limbs asunder, was constantly kept
      going.&nbsp; What these unhappy men confessed, or what was ever confessed
      by any one under that agony, must always be received with great doubt, as
      it is certain that people have frequently owned to the most absurd and
      impossible crimes to escape such dreadful suffering.&nbsp; But I cannot
      doubt it to have been proved by papers, that there were many plots, both
      among the Jesuits, and with France, and with Scotland, and with Spain, for
      the destruction of Queen Elizabeth, for the placing of Mary on the throne,
      and for the revival of the old religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the English people were too ready to believe in plots, there were, as I
      have said, good reasons for it.&nbsp; When the massacre of Saint
      Bartholomew was yet fresh in their recollection, a great Protestant Dutch
      hero, the <span class="smcap">Prince of Orange</span>, was shot by an
      assassin, who confessed that he had been kept and trained for the purpose
      in a college of Jesuits.&nbsp; The Dutch, in this surprise and distress,
      offered to make Elizabeth their sovereign, but she declined the honour,
      and sent them a small army instead, under the command of the Earl of
      Leicester, who, although a capital Court favourite, was not much of a
      general.&nbsp; He did so little in Holland, that his campaign there would
      probably have been forgotten, but for its occasioning the death of one of
      the best writers, the best knights, and the best gentlemen, of that or any
      age.&nbsp; This was <span class="smcap">Sir Philip Sidney</span>, who was
      wounded by a musket ball in the thigh as he mounted a fresh horse, after
      having had his own killed under him.&nbsp; He had to ride back wounded, a
      long distance, and was very faint with fatigue and loss of blood, when
      some water, for which he had eagerly asked, was handed to him.&nbsp; But
      he was so good and gentle even then, that seeing a poor badly wounded
      common soldier lying on the ground, looking at the water with longing
      eyes, he said, &lsquo;Thy necessity is greater than mine,&rsquo; and gave
      it up to him.&nbsp; This touching action of a noble heart is perhaps as
      well known as any incident in history&mdash;is as famous far and wide as
      the blood-stained Tower of London, with its axe, and block, and murders
      out of number.&nbsp; So delightful is an act of true humanity, and so glad
      are mankind to remember it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home, intelligence of plots began to thicken every day.&nbsp; I suppose
      the people never did live under such continual terrors as those by which
      they were possessed now, of Catholic risings, and burnings, and
      poisonings, and I don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; Still, we must always
      remember that they lived near and close to awful realities of that kind,
      and that with their experience it was not difficult to believe in any
      enormity.&nbsp; The government had the same fear, and did not take the
      best means of discovering the truth&mdash;for, besides torturing the
      suspected, it employed paid spies, who will always lie for their own
      profit.&nbsp; It even made some of the conspiracies it brought to light,
      by sending false letters to disaffected people, inviting them to join in
      pretended plots, which they too readily did.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, one great real plot was at length discovered, and it ended the career
      of Mary, Queen of Scots.&nbsp; A seminary priest named <span class="smcap">Ballard</span>,
      and a Spanish soldier named <span class="smcap">Savage</span>, set on and
      encouraged by certain French priests, imparted a design to one <span
      class="smcap">Antony Babington</span>&mdash;a gentleman of fortune in
      Derbyshire, who had been for some time a secret agent of Mary&rsquo;s&mdash;for
      murdering the Queen.&nbsp; Babington then confided the scheme to some
      other Catholic gentlemen who were his friends, and they joined in it
      heartily.&nbsp; They were vain, weak-headed young men, ridiculously
      confident, and preposterously proud of their plan; for they got a gimcrack
      painting made, of the six choice spirits who were to murder Elizabeth,
      with Babington in an attitude for the centre figure.&nbsp; Two of their
      number, however, one of whom was a priest, kept Elizabeth&rsquo;s wisest
      minister, <span class="smcap">Sir Francis Walsingham</span>, acquainted
      with the whole project from the first.&nbsp; The conspirators were
      completely deceived to the final point, when Babington gave Savage,
      because he was shabby, a ring from his finger, and some money from his
      purse, wherewith to buy himself new clothes in which to kill the Queen.&nbsp;
      Walsingham, having then full evidence against the whole band, and two
      letters of Mary&rsquo;s besides, resolved to seize them.&nbsp; Suspecting
      something wrong, they stole out of the city, one by one, and hid
      themselves in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, and other places which really were
      hiding places then; but they were all taken, and all executed.&nbsp; When
      they were seized, a gentleman was sent from Court to inform Mary of the
      fact, and of her being involved in the discovery.&nbsp; Her friends have
      complained that she was kept in very hard and severe custody.&nbsp; It
      does not appear very likely, for she was going out a hunting that very
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Elizabeth had been warned long ago, by one in France who had good
      information of what was secretly doing, that in holding Mary alive, she
      held &lsquo;the wolf who would devour her.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bishop of
      London had, more lately, given the Queen&rsquo;s favourite minister the
      advice in writing, &lsquo;forthwith to cut off the Scottish Queen&rsquo;s
      head.&rsquo;&nbsp; The question now was, what to do with her?&nbsp; The
      Earl of Leicester wrote a little note home from Holland, recommending that
      she should be quietly poisoned; that noble favourite having accustomed his
      mind, it is possible, to remedies of that nature.&nbsp; His black advice,
      however, was disregarded, and she was brought to trial at Fotheringay
      Castle in Northamptonshire, before a tribunal of forty, composed of both
      religions.&nbsp; There, and in the Star Chamber at Westminster, the trial
      lasted a fortnight.&nbsp; She defended herself with great ability, but
      could only deny the confessions that had been made by Babington and
      others; could only call her own letters, produced against her by her own
      secretaries, forgeries; and, in short, could only deny everything.&nbsp;
      She was found guilty, and declared to have incurred the penalty of death.&nbsp;
      The Parliament met, approved the sentence, and prayed the Queen to have it
      executed.&nbsp; The Queen replied that she requested them to consider
      whether no means could be found of saving Mary&rsquo;s life without
      endangering her own.&nbsp; The Parliament rejoined, No; and the citizens
      illuminated their houses and lighted bonfires, in token of their joy that
      all these plots and troubles were to be ended by the death of the Queen of
      Scots.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, feeling sure that her time was now come, wrote a letter to the Queen
      of England, making three entreaties; first, that she might be buried in
      France; secondly, that she might not be executed in secret, but before her
      servants and some others; thirdly, that after her death, her servants
      should not be molested, but should be suffered to go home with the
      legacies she left them.&nbsp; It was an affecting letter, and Elizabeth
      shed tears over it, but sent no answer.&nbsp; Then came a special
      ambassador from France, and another from Scotland, to intercede for Mary&rsquo;s
      life; and then the nation began to clamour, more and more, for her death.

      What the real feelings or intentions of Elizabeth were, can never be known
      now; but I strongly suspect her of only wishing one thing more than Mary&rsquo;s
      death, and that was to keep free of the blame of it.&nbsp; On the first of
      February, one thousand five hundred and eighty-seven, Lord Burleigh having
      drawn out the warrant for the execution, the Queen sent to the secretary
      <span class="smcap">Davison</span> to bring it to her, that she might sign
      it: which she did.&nbsp; Next day, when Davison told her it was sealed,
      she angrily asked him why such haste was necessary?&nbsp; Next day but
      one, she joked about it, and swore a little.&nbsp; Again, next day but
      one, she seemed to complain that it was not yet done, but still she would
      not be plain with those about her.&nbsp; So, on the seventh, the Earls of
      Kent and Shrewsbury, with the Sheriff of Northamptonshire, came with the
      warrant to Fotheringay, to tell the Queen of Scots to prepare for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      When those messengers of ill omen were gone, Mary made a frugal supper,
      drank to her servants, read over her will, went to bed, slept for some
      hours, and then arose and passed the remainder of the night saying
      prayers.&nbsp; In the morning she dressed herself in her best clothes;
      and, at eight o&rsquo;clock when the sheriff came for her to her chapel,
      took leave of her servants who were there assembled praying with her, and
      went down-stairs, carrying a Bible in one hand and a crucifix in the
      other.&nbsp; Two of her women and four of her men were allowed to be
      present in the hall; where a low scaffold, only two feet from the ground,
      was erected and covered with black; and where the executioner from the
      Tower, and his assistant, stood, dressed in black velvet.&nbsp; The hall
      was full of people.&nbsp; While the sentence was being read she sat upon a
      stool; and, when it was finished, she again denied her guilt, as she had
      done before.&nbsp; The Earl of Kent and the Dean of Peterborough, in their
      Protestant zeal, made some very unnecessary speeches to her; to which she
      replied that she died in the Catholic religion, and they need not trouble
      themselves about that matter.&nbsp; When her head and neck were uncovered
      by the executioners, she said that she had not been used to be undressed
      by such hands, or before so much company.&nbsp; Finally, one of her women
      fastened a cloth over her face, and she laid her neck upon the block, and
      repeated more than once in Latin, &lsquo;Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend
      my spirit!&rsquo;&nbsp; Some say her head was struck off in two blows,
      some say in three.&nbsp; However that be, when it was held up, streaming
      with blood, the real hair beneath the false hair she had long worn was
      seen to be as grey as that of a woman of seventy, though she was at that
      time only in her forty-sixth year.&nbsp; All her beauty was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was beautiful enough to her little dog, who cowered under her
      dress, frightened, when she went upon the scaffold, and who lay down
      beside her headless body when all her earthly sorrows were over.
    </p>
    <h3>
      THIRD PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      On its being formally made known to Elizabeth that the sentence had been
      executed on the Queen of Scots, she showed the utmost grief and rage,
      drove her favourites from her with violent indignation, and sent Davison
      to the Tower; from which place he was only released in the end by paying
      an immense fine which completely ruined him.&nbsp; Elizabeth not only
      over-acted her part in making these pretences, but most basely reduced to
      poverty one of her faithful servants for no other fault than obeying her
      commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, King of Scotland, Mary&rsquo;s son, made a show likewise of being
      very angry on the occasion; but he was a pensioner of England to the
      amount of five thousand pounds a year, and he had known very little of his
      mother, and he possibly regarded her as the murderer of his father, and he
      soon took it quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, King of Spain, however, threatened to do greater things than ever
      had been done yet, to set up the Catholic religion and punish Protestant
      England.&nbsp; Elizabeth, hearing that he and the Prince of Parma were
      making great preparations for this purpose, in order to be beforehand with
      them sent out <span class="smcap">Admiral Drake</span> (a famous
      navigator, who had sailed about the world, and had already brought great
      plunder from Spain) to the port of Cadiz, where he burnt a hundred vessels
      full of stores.&nbsp; This great loss obliged the Spaniards to put off the
      invasion for a year; but it was none the less formidable for that,
      amounting to one hundred and thirty ships, nineteen thousand soldiers,
      eight thousand sailors, two thousand slaves, and between two and three
      thousand great guns.&nbsp; England was not idle in making ready to resist
      this great force.&nbsp; All the men between sixteen years old and sixty,
      were trained and drilled; the national fleet of ships (in number only
      thirty-four at first) was enlarged by public contributions and by private
      ships, fitted out by noblemen; the city of London, of its own accord,
      furnished double the number of ships and men that it was required to
      provide; and, if ever the national spirit was up in England, it was up all
      through the country to resist the Spaniards.&nbsp; Some of the Queen&rsquo;s
      advisers were for seizing the principal English Catholics, and putting
      them to death; but the Queen&mdash;who, to her honour, used to say, that
      she would never believe any ill of her subjects, which a parent would not
      believe of her own children&mdash;rejected the advice, and only confined a
      few of those who were the most suspected, in the fens in Lincolnshire.&nbsp;
      The great body of Catholics deserved this confidence; for they behaved
      most loyally, nobly, and bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with all England firing up like one strong, angry man, and with both
      sides of the Thames fortified, and with the soldiers under arms, and with
      the sailors in their ships, the country waited for the coming of the proud
      Spanish fleet, which was called <span class="smcap">The Invincible Armada</span>.&nbsp;
      The Queen herself, riding in armour on a white horse, and the Earl of
      Essex and the Earl of Leicester holding her bridal rein, made a brave
      speech to the troops at Tilbury Fort opposite Gravesend, which was
      received with such enthusiasm as is seldom known.&nbsp; Then came the
      Spanish Armada into the English Channel, sailing along in the form of a
      half moon, of such great size that it was seven miles broad.&nbsp; But the
      English were quickly upon it, and woe then to all the Spanish ships that
      dropped a little out of the half moon, for the English took them
      instantly!&nbsp; And it soon appeared that the great Armada was anything
      but invincible, for on a summer night, bold Drake sent eight blazing
      fire-ships right into the midst of it.&nbsp; In terrible consternation the
      Spaniards tried to get out to sea, and so became dispersed; the English
      pursued them at a great advantage; a storm came on, and drove the
      Spaniards among rocks and shoals; and the swift end of the Invincible
      fleet was, that it lost thirty great ships and ten thousand men, and,
      defeated and disgraced, sailed home again.&nbsp; Being afraid to go by the
      English Channel, it sailed all round Scotland and Ireland; some of the
      ships getting cast away on the latter coast in bad weather, the Irish, who
      were a kind of savages, plundered those vessels and killed their crews.&nbsp;
      So ended this great attempt to invade and conquer England.&nbsp; And I
      think it will be a long time before any other invincible fleet coming to
      England with the same object, will fare much better than the Spanish
      Armada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the Spanish king had had this bitter taste of English bravery, he
      was so little the wiser for it, as still to entertain his old designs, and
      even to conceive the absurd idea of placing his daughter on the English
      throne.&nbsp; But the Earl of Essex, <span class="smcap">Sir Walter
      Raleigh</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Howard</span>, and some
      other distinguished leaders, put to sea from Plymouth, entered the port of
      Cadiz once more, obtained a complete victory over the shipping assembled
      there, and got possession of the town.&nbsp; In obedience to the Queen&rsquo;s
      express instructions, they behaved with great humanity; and the principal
      loss of the Spaniards was a vast sum of money which they had to pay for
      ransom.&nbsp; This was one of many gallant achievements on the sea,
      effected in this reign.&nbsp; Sir Walter Raleigh himself, after marrying a
      maid of honour and giving offence to the Maiden Queen thereby, had already
      sailed to South America in search of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Leicester was now dead, and so was Sir Thomas Walsingham, whom
      Lord Burleigh was soon to follow.&nbsp; The principal favourite was the
      <span class="smcap">Earl of Essex</span>, a spirited and handsome man, a
      favourite with the people too as well as with the Queen, and possessed of
      many admirable qualities.&nbsp; It was much debated at Court whether there
      should be peace with Spain or no, and he was very urgent for war.&nbsp; He
      also tried hard to have his own way in the appointment of a deputy to
      govern in Ireland.&nbsp; One day, while this question was in dispute, he
      hastily took offence, and turned his back upon the Queen; as a gentle
      reminder of which impropriety, the Queen gave him a tremendous box on the
      ear, and told him to go to the devil.&nbsp; He went home instead, and did
      not reappear at Court for half a year or so, when he and the Queen were
      reconciled, though never (as some suppose) thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time the fate of the Earl of Essex and that of the Queen seemed
      to be blended together.&nbsp; The Irish were still perpetually quarrelling
      and fighting among themselves, and he went over to Ireland as Lord
      Lieutenant, to the great joy of his enemies (Sir Walter Raleigh among the
      rest), who were glad to have so dangerous a rival far off.&nbsp; Not being
      by any means successful there, and knowing that his enemies would take
      advantage of that circumstance to injure him with the Queen, he came home
      again, though against her orders.&nbsp; The Queen being taken by surprise
      when he appeared before her, gave him her hand to kiss, and he was
      overjoyed&mdash;though it was not a very lovely hand by this time&mdash;but
      in the course of the same day she ordered him to confine himself to his
      room, and two or three days afterwards had him taken into custody.&nbsp;
      With the same sort of caprice&mdash;and as capricious an old woman she now
      was, as ever wore a crown or a head either&mdash;she sent him broth from
      her own table on his falling ill from anxiety, and cried about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man who could find comfort and occupation in his books, and he
      did so for a time; not the least happy time, I dare say, of his life.&nbsp;
      But it happened unfortunately for him, that he held a monopoly in sweet
      wines: which means that nobody could sell them without purchasing his
      permission.&nbsp; This right, which was only for a term, expiring, he
      applied to have it renewed.&nbsp; The Queen refused, with the rather
      strong observation&mdash;but she <i>did</i> make strong observations&mdash;that
      an unruly beast must be stinted in his food.&nbsp; Upon this, the angry
      Earl, who had been already deprived of many offices, thought himself in
      danger of complete ruin, and turned against the Queen, whom he called a
      vain old woman who had grown as crooked in her mind as she had in her
      figure.&nbsp; These uncomplimentary expressions the ladies of the Court
      immediately snapped up and carried to the Queen, whom they did not put in
      a better tempter, you may believe.&nbsp; The same Court ladies, when they
      had beautiful dark hair of their own, used to wear false red hair, to be
      like the Queen.&nbsp; So they were not very high-spirited ladies, however
      high in rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst object of the Earl of Essex, and some friends of his who used to
      meet at <span class="smcap">Lord Southampton&rsquo;s</span> house, was to
      obtain possession of the Queen, and oblige her by force to dismiss her
      ministers and change her favourites.&nbsp; On Saturday the seventh of
      February, one thousand six hundred and one, the council suspecting this,
      summoned the Earl to come before them.&nbsp; He, pretending to be ill,
      declined; it was then settled among his friends, that as the next day
      would be Sunday, when many of the citizens usually assembled at the Cross
      by St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, he should make one bold effort to induce
      them to rise and follow him to the Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on the Sunday morning, he and a small body of adherents started out of
      his house&mdash;Essex House by the Strand, with steps to the river&mdash;having
      first shut up in it, as prisoners, some members of the council who came to
      examine him&mdash;and hurried into the City with the Earl at their head
      crying out &lsquo;For the Queen!&nbsp; For the Queen!&nbsp; A plot is laid
      for my life!&rsquo;&nbsp; No one heeded them, however, and when they came
      to St. Paul&rsquo;s there were no citizens there.&nbsp; In the meantime
      the prisoners at Essex House had been released by one of the Earl&rsquo;s
      own friends; he had been promptly proclaimed a traitor in the City itself;
      and the streets were barricaded with carts and guarded by soldiers.&nbsp;
      The Earl got back to his house by water, with difficulty, and after an
      attempt to defend his house against the troops and cannon by which it was
      soon surrounded, gave himself up that night.&nbsp; He was brought to trial
      on the nineteenth, and found guilty; on the twenty-fifth, he was executed
      on Tower Hill, where he died, at thirty-four years old, both courageously
      and penitently.&nbsp; His step-father suffered with him.&nbsp; His enemy,
      Sir Walter Raleigh, stood near the scaffold all the time&mdash;but not so
      near it as we shall see him stand, before we finish his history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, as in the cases of the Duke of Norfolk and Mary Queen of
      Scots, the Queen had commanded, and countermanded, and again commanded,
      the execution.&nbsp; It is probable that the death of her young and
      gallant favourite in the prime of his good qualities, was never off her
      mind afterwards, but she held out, the same vain, obstinate and capricious
      woman, for another year.&nbsp; Then she danced before her Court on a state
      occasion&mdash;and cut, I should think, a mighty ridiculous figure, doing
      so in an immense ruff, stomacher and wig, at seventy years old.&nbsp; For
      another year still, she held out, but, without any more dancing, and as a
      moody, sorrowful, broken creature.&nbsp; At last, on the tenth of March,
      one thousand six hundred and three, having been ill of a very bad cold,
      and made worse by the death of the Countess of Nottingham who was her
      intimate friend, she fell into a stupor and was supposed to be dead.&nbsp;
      She recovered her consciousness, however, and then nothing would induce
      her to go to bed; for she said that she knew that if she did, she should
      never get up again.&nbsp; There she lay for ten days, on cushions on the
      floor, without any food, until the Lord Admiral got her into bed at last,
      partly by persuasions and partly by main force.&nbsp; When they asked her
      who should succeed her, she replied that her seat had been the seat of
      Kings, and that she would have for her successor, &lsquo;No rascal&rsquo;s
      son, but a King&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; Upon this, the lords present stared
      at one another, and took the liberty of asking whom she meant; to which
      she replied, &lsquo;Whom should I mean, but our cousin of Scotland!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      This was on the twenty-third of March.&nbsp; They asked her once again
      that day, after she was speechless, whether she was still in the same
      mind?&nbsp; She struggled up in bed, and joined her hands over her head in
      the form of a crown, as the only reply she could make.&nbsp; At three o&rsquo;clock
      next morning, she very quietly died, in the forty-fifth year of her reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      That reign had been a glorious one, and is made for ever memorable by the
      distinguished men who flourished in it.&nbsp; Apart from the great
      voyagers, statesmen, and scholars, whom it produced, the names of <span
      class="smcap">Bacon</span>, <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, and <span
      class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>, will always be remembered with pride and
      veneration by the civilised world, and will always impart (though with no
      great reason, perhaps) some portion of their lustre to the name of
      Elizabeth herself.&nbsp; It was a great reign for discovery, for commerce,
      and for English enterprise and spirit in general.&nbsp; It was a great
      reign for the Protestant religion and for the Reformation which made
      England free.&nbsp; The Queen was very popular, and in her progresses, or
      journeys about her dominions, was everywhere received with the liveliest
      joy.&nbsp; I think the truth is, that she was not half so good as she has
      been made out, and not half so bad as she has been made out.&nbsp; She had
      her fine qualities, but she was coarse, capricious, and treacherous, and
      had all the faults of an excessively vain young woman long after she was
      an old one.&nbsp; On the whole, she had a great deal too much of her
      father in her, to please me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many improvements and luxuries were introduced in the course of these
      five-and-forty years in the general manner of living; but cock-fighting,
      bull-baiting, and bear-baiting, were still the national amusements; and a
      coach was so rarely seen, and was such an ugly and cumbersome affair when
      it was seen, that even the Queen herself, on many high occasions, rode on
      horseback on a pillion behind the Lord Chancellor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE FIRST
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our cousin of Scotland&rsquo; was ugly, awkward, and shuffling both
      in mind and person.&nbsp; His tongue was much too large for his mouth, his
      legs were much too weak for his body, and his dull goggle-eyes stared and
      rolled like an idiot&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was cunning, covetous, wasteful,
      idle, drunken, greedy, dirty, cowardly, a great swearer, and the most
      conceited man on earth.&nbsp; His figure&mdash;what is commonly called
      rickety from his birth&mdash;presented a most ridiculous appearance,
      dressed in thick padded clothes, as a safeguard against being stabbed (of
      which he lived in continual fear), of a grass-green colour from head to
      foot, with a hunting-horn dangling at his side instead of a sword, and his
      hat and feather sticking over one eye, or hanging on the back of his head,
      as he happened to toss it on.&nbsp; He used to loll on the necks of his
      favourite courtiers, and slobber their faces, and kiss and pinch their
      cheeks; and the greatest favourite he ever had, used to sign himself in
      his letters to his royal master, His Majesty&rsquo;s &lsquo;dog and slave,&rsquo;
      and used to address his majesty as &lsquo;his Sowship.&rsquo;&nbsp; His
      majesty was the worst rider ever seen, and thought himself the best.&nbsp;
      He was one of the most impertinent talkers (in the broadest Scotch) ever
      heard, and boasted of being unanswerable in all manner of argument.&nbsp;
      He wrote some of the most wearisome treatises ever read&mdash;among
      others, a book upon witchcraft, in which he was a devout believer&mdash;and
      thought himself a prodigy of authorship.&nbsp; He thought, and wrote, and
      said, that a king had a right to make and unmake what laws he pleased, and
      ought to be accountable to nobody on earth.&nbsp; This is the plain, true
      character of the personage whom the greatest men about the court praised
      and flattered to that degree, that I doubt if there be anything much more
      shameful in the annals of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to the English throne with great ease.&nbsp; The miseries of a
      disputed succession had been felt so long, and so dreadfully, that he was
      proclaimed within a few hours of Elizabeth&rsquo;s death, and was accepted
      by the nation, even without being asked to give any pledge that he would
      govern well, or that he would redress crying grievances.&nbsp; He took a
      month to come from Edinburgh to London; and, by way of exercising his new
      power, hanged a pickpocket on the journey without any trial, and knighted
      everybody he could lay hold of.&nbsp; He made two hundred knights before
      he got to his palace in London, and seven hundred before he had been in it
      three months.&nbsp; He also shovelled sixty-two new peers into the House
      of Lords&mdash;and there was a pretty large sprinkling of Scotchmen among
      them, you may believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Sowship&rsquo;s prime Minister, <span class="smcap">Cecil</span> (for
      I cannot do better than call his majesty what his favourite called him),
      was the enemy of Sir Walter Raleigh, and also of Sir Walter&rsquo;s
      political friend, <span class="smcap">Lord Cobham</span>; and his Sowship&rsquo;s
      first trouble was a plot originated by these two, and entered into by some
      others, with the old object of seizing the King and keeping him in
      imprisonment until he should change his ministers.&nbsp; There were
      Catholic priests in the plot, and there were Puritan noblemen too; for,
      although the Catholics and Puritans were strongly opposed to each other,
      they united at this time against his Sowship, because they knew that he
      had a design against both, after pretending to be friendly to each; this
      design being to have only one high and convenient form of the Protestant
      religion, which everybody should be bound to belong to, whether they liked
      it or not.&nbsp; This plot was mixed up with another, which may or may not
      have had some reference to placing on the throne, at some time, the <span
      class="smcap">Lady Arabella Stuart</span>; whose misfortune it was, to be
      the daughter of the younger brother of his Sowship&rsquo;s father, but who
      was quite innocent of any part in the scheme.&nbsp; Sir Walter Raleigh was
      accused on the confession of Lord Cobham&mdash;a miserable creature, who
      said one thing at one time, and another thing at another time, and could
      be relied upon in nothing.&nbsp; The trial of Sir Walter Raleigh lasted
      from eight in the morning until nearly midnight; he defended himself with
      such eloquence, genius, and spirit against all accusations, and against
      the insults of <span class="smcap">Coke</span>, the Attorney-General&mdash;who,
      according to the custom of the time, foully abused him&mdash;that those
      who went there detesting the prisoner, came away admiring him, and
      declaring that anything so wonderful and so captivating was never heard.&nbsp;
      He was found guilty, nevertheless, and sentenced to death.&nbsp; Execution
      was deferred, and he was taken to the Tower.&nbsp; The two Catholic
      priests, less fortunate, were executed with the usual atrocity; and Lord
      Cobham and two others were pardoned on the scaffold.&nbsp; His Sowship
      thought it wonderfully knowing in him to surprise the people by pardoning
      these three at the very block; but, blundering, and bungling, as usual, he
      had very nearly overreached himself.&nbsp; For, the messenger on horseback
      who brought the pardon, came so late, that he was pushed to the outside of
      the crowd, and was obliged to shout and roar out what he came for.&nbsp;
      The miserable Cobham did not gain much by being spared that day.&nbsp; He
      lived, both as a prisoner and a beggar, utterly despised, and miserably
      poor, for thirteen years, and then died in an old outhouse belonging to
      one of his former servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plot got rid of, and Sir Walter Raleigh safely shut up in the Tower,
      his Sowship held a great dispute with the Puritans on their presenting a
      petition to him, and had it all his own way&mdash;not so very wonderful,
      as he would talk continually, and would not hear anybody else&mdash;and
      filled the Bishops with admiration.&nbsp; It was comfortably settled that
      there was to be only one form of religion, and that all men were to think
      exactly alike.&nbsp; But, although this was arranged two centuries and a
      half ago, and although the arrangement was supported by much fining and
      imprisonment, I do not find that it is quite successful, even yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Sowship, having that uncommonly high opinion of himself as a king, had
      a very low opinion of Parliament as a power that audaciously wanted to
      control him.&nbsp; When he called his first Parliament after he had been
      king a year, he accordingly thought he would take pretty high ground with
      them, and told them that he commanded them &lsquo;as an absolute king.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      The Parliament thought those strong words, and saw the necessity of
      upholding their authority.&nbsp; His Sowship had three children: Prince
      Henry, Prince Charles, and the Princess Elizabeth.&nbsp; It would have
      been well for one of these, and we shall too soon see which, if he had
      learnt a little wisdom concerning Parliaments from his father&rsquo;s
      obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the people still labouring under their old dread of the Catholic
      religion, this Parliament revived and strengthened the severe laws against
      it.&nbsp; And this so angered <span class="smcap">Robert Catesby</span>, a
      restless Catholic gentleman of an old family, that he formed one of the
      most desperate and terrible designs ever conceived in the mind of man; no
      less a scheme than the Gunpowder Plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      His object was, when the King, lords, and commons, should be assembled at
      the next opening of Parliament, to blow them up, one and all, with a great
      mine of gunpowder.&nbsp; The first person to whom he confided this
      horrible idea was <span class="smcap">Thomas Winter</span>, a
      Worcestershire gentleman who had served in the army abroad, and had been
      secretly employed in Catholic projects.&nbsp; While Winter was yet
      undecided, and when he had gone over to the Netherlands, to learn from the
      Spanish Ambassador there whether there was any hope of Catholics being
      relieved through the intercession of the King of Spain with his Sowship,
      he found at Ostend a tall, dark, daring man, whom he had known when they
      were both soldiers abroad, and whose name was <span class="smcap">Guido</span>&mdash;or
      <span class="smcap">Guy</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fawkes</span>.&nbsp;
      Resolved to join the plot, he proposed it to this man, knowing him to be
      the man for any desperate deed, and they two came back to England
      together.&nbsp; Here, they admitted two other conspirators; <span
      class="smcap">Thomas Percy</span>, related to the Earl of Northumberland,
      and <span class="smcap">John Wright</span>, his brother-in-law.&nbsp; All
      these met together in a solitary house in the open fields which were then
      near Clement&rsquo;s Inn, now a closely blocked-up part of London; and
      when they had all taken a great oath of secrecy, Catesby told the rest
      what his plan was.&nbsp; They then went up-stairs into a garret, and
      received the Sacrament from <span class="smcap">Father Gerard</span>, a
      Jesuit, who is said not to have known actually of the Gunpowder Plot, but
      who, I think, must have had his suspicions that there was something
      desperate afoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy was a Gentleman Pensioner, and as he had occasional duties to
      perform about the Court, then kept at Whitehall, there would be nothing
      suspicious in his living at Westminster.&nbsp; So, having looked well
      about him, and having found a house to let, the back of which joined the
      Parliament House, he hired it of a person named <span class="smcap">Ferris</span>,
      for the purpose of undermining the wall.&nbsp; Having got possession of
      this house, the conspirators hired another on the Lambeth side of the
      Thames, which they used as a storehouse for wood, gunpowder, and other
      combustible matters.&nbsp; These were to be removed at night (and
      afterwards were removed), bit by bit, to the house at Westminster; and,
      that there might be some trusty person to keep watch over the Lambeth
      stores, they admitted another conspirator, by name <span class="smcap">Robert
      Kay</span>, a very poor Catholic gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these arrangements had been made some months, and it was a dark,
      wintry, December night, when the conspirators, who had been in the
      meantime dispersed to avoid observation, met in the house at Westminster,
      and began to dig.&nbsp; They had laid in a good stock of eatables, to
      avoid going in and out, and they dug and dug with great ardour.&nbsp; But,
      the wall being tremendously thick, and the work very severe, they took
      into their plot <span class="smcap">Christopher Wright</span>, a younger
      brother of John Wright, that they might have a new pair of hands to help.&nbsp;
      And Christopher Wright fell to like a fresh man, and they dug and dug by
      night and by day, and Fawkes stood sentinel all the time.&nbsp; And if any
      man&rsquo;s heart seemed to fail him at all, Fawkes said, &lsquo;Gentlemen,
      we have abundance of powder and shot here, and there is no fear of our
      being taken alive, even if discovered.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same Fawkes, who,
      in the capacity of sentinel, was always prowling about, soon picked up the
      intelligence that the King had prorogued the Parliament again, from the
      seventh of February, the day first fixed upon, until the third of October.&nbsp;
      When the conspirators knew this, they agreed to separate until after the
      Christmas holidays, and to take no notice of each other in the meanwhile,
      and never to write letters to one another on any account.&nbsp; So, the
      house in Westminster was shut up again, and I suppose the neighbours
      thought that those strange-looking men who lived there so gloomily, and
      went out so seldom, were gone away to have a merry Christmas somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of February, sixteen hundred and five, when Catesby
      met his fellow-conspirators again at this Westminster house.&nbsp; He had
      now admitted three more; <span class="smcap">John Grant</span>, a
      Warwickshire gentleman of a melancholy temper, who lived in a doleful
      house near Stratford-upon-Avon, with a frowning wall all round it, and a
      deep moat; <span class="smcap">Robert Winter</span>, eldest brother of
      Thomas; and Catesby&rsquo;s own servant, <span class="smcap">Thomas Bates</span>,
      who, Catesby thought, had had some suspicion of what his master was about.&nbsp;
      These three had all suffered more or less for their religion in Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      time.&nbsp; And now, they all began to dig again, and they dug and dug by
      night and by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found it dismal work alone there, underground, with such a fearful
      secret on their minds, and so many murders before them.&nbsp; They were
      filled with wild fancies.&nbsp; Sometimes, they thought they heard a great
      bell tolling, deep down in the earth under the Parliament House;
      sometimes, they thought they heard low voices muttering about the
      Gunpowder Plot; once in the morning, they really did hear a great rumbling
      noise over their heads, as they dug and sweated in their mine.&nbsp; Every
      man stopped and looked aghast at his neighbour, wondering what had
      happened, when that bold prowler, Fawkes, who had been out to look, came
      in and told them that it was only a dealer in coals who had occupied a
      cellar under the Parliament House, removing his stock in trade to some
      other place.&nbsp; Upon this, the conspirators, who with all their digging
      and digging had not yet dug through the tremendously thick wall, changed
      their plan; hired that cellar, which was directly under the House of
      Lords; put six-and-thirty barrels of gunpowder in it, and covered them
      over with fagots and coals.&nbsp; Then they all dispersed again till
      September, when the following new conspirators were admitted; <span
      class="smcap">Sir Edward Baynham</span>, of Gloucestershire; <span
      class="smcap">Sir Everard Digby</span>, of Rutlandshire; <span
      class="smcap">Ambrose Rookwood</span>, of Suffolk; <span class="smcap">Francis
      Tresham</span>, of Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Most of these were rich, and
      were to assist the plot, some with money and some with horses on which the
      conspirators were to ride through the country and rouse the Catholics
      after the Parliament should be blown into air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parliament being again prorogued from the third of October to the fifth of
      November, and the conspirators being uneasy lest their design should have
      been found out, Thomas Winter said he would go up into the House of Lords
      on the day of the prorogation, and see how matters looked.&nbsp; Nothing
      could be better.&nbsp; The unconscious Commissioners were walking about
      and talking to one another, just over the six-and-thirty barrels of
      gunpowder.&nbsp; He came back and told the rest so, and they went on with
      their preparations.&nbsp; They hired a ship, and kept it ready in the
      Thames, in which Fawkes was to sail for Flanders after firing with a slow
      match the train that was to explode the powder.&nbsp; A number of Catholic
      gentlemen not in the secret, were invited, on pretence of a hunting party,
      to meet Sir Everard Digby at Dunchurch on the fatal day, that they might
      be ready to act together.&nbsp; And now all was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, now, the great wickedness and danger which had been all along at the
      bottom of this wicked plot, began to show itself.&nbsp; As the fifth of
      November drew near, most of the conspirators, remembering that they had
      friends and relations who would be in the House of Lords that day, felt
      some natural relenting, and a wish to warn them to keep away.&nbsp; They
      were not much comforted by Catesby&rsquo;s declaring that in such a cause
      he would blow up his own son.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lord Mounteagle</span>,
      Tresham&rsquo;s brother-in-law, was certain to be in the house; and when
      Tresham found that he could not prevail upon the rest to devise any means
      of sparing their friends, he wrote a mysterious letter to this lord and
      left it at his lodging in the dusk, urging him to keep away from the
      opening of Parliament, &lsquo;since God and man had concurred to punish
      the wickedness of the times.&rsquo;&nbsp; It contained the words &lsquo;that
      the Parliament should receive a terrible blow, and yet should not see who
      hurt them.&rsquo;&nbsp; And it added, &lsquo;the danger is past, as soon
      as you have burnt the letter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ministers and courtiers made out that his Sowship, by a direct miracle
      from Heaven, found out what this letter meant.&nbsp; The truth is, that
      they were not long (as few men would be) in finding out for themselves;
      and it was decided to let the conspirators alone, until the very day
      before the opening of Parliament.&nbsp; That the conspirators had their
      fears, is certain; for, Tresham himself said before them all, that they
      were every one dead men; and, although even he did not take flight, there
      is reason to suppose that he had warned other persons besides Lord
      Mounteagle.&nbsp; However, they were all firm; and Fawkes, who was a man
      of iron, went down every day and night to keep watch in the cellar as
      usual.&nbsp; He was there about two in the afternoon of the fourth, when
      the Lord Chamberlain and Lord Mounteagle threw open the door and looked
      in.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who are you, friend?&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo;
      said Fawkes, &lsquo;I am Mr. Percy&rsquo;s servant, and am looking after
      his store of fuel here.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your master has laid in a
      pretty good store,&rsquo; they returned, and shut the door, and went away.&nbsp;
      Fawkes, upon this, posted off to the other conspirators to tell them all
      was quiet, and went back and shut himself up in the dark, black cellar
      again, where he heard the bell go twelve o&rsquo;clock and usher in the
      fifth of November.&nbsp; About two hours afterwards, he slowly opened the
      door, and came out to look about him, in his old prowling way.&nbsp; He
      was instantly seized and bound, by a party of soldiers under <span
      class="smcap">Sir Thomas Knevett</span>.&nbsp; He had a watch upon him,
      some touchwood, some tinder, some slow matches; and there was a dark
      lantern with a candle in it, lighted, behind the door.&nbsp; He had his
      boots and spurs on&mdash;to ride to the ship, I suppose&mdash;and it was
      well for the soldiers that they took him so suddenly.&nbsp; If they had
      left him but a moment&rsquo;s time to light a match, he certainly would
      have tossed it in among the powder, and blown up himself and them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took him to the King&rsquo;s bed-chamber first of all, and there the
      King (causing him to be held very tight, and keeping a good way off),
      asked him how he could have the heart to intend to destroy so many
      innocent people?&nbsp; &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said Guy Fawkes, &lsquo;desperate
      diseases need desperate remedies.&rsquo;&nbsp; To a little Scotch
      favourite, with a face like a terrier, who asked him (with no particular
      wisdom) why he had collected so much gunpowder, he replied, because he had
      meant to blow Scotchmen back to Scotland, and it would take a deal of
      powder to do that.&nbsp; Next day he was carried to the Tower, but would
      make no confession.&nbsp; Even after being horribly tortured, he confessed
      nothing that the Government did not already know; though he must have been
      in a fearful state&mdash;as his signature, still preserved, in contrast
      with his natural hand-writing before he was put upon the dreadful rack,
      most frightfully shows.&nbsp; Bates, a very different man, soon said the
      Jesuits had had to do with the plot, and probably, under the torture,
      would as readily have said anything.&nbsp; Tresham, taken and put in the
      Tower too, made confessions and unmade them, and died of an illness that
      was heavy upon him.&nbsp; Rookwood, who had stationed relays of his own
      horses all the way to Dunchurch, did not mount to escape until the middle
      of the day, when the news of the plot was all over London.&nbsp; On the
      road, he came up with the two Wrights, Catesby, and Percy; and they all
      galloped together into Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Thence to Dunchurch, where
      they found the proposed party assembled.&nbsp; Finding, however, that
      there had been a plot, and that it had been discovered, the party
      disappeared in the course of the night, and left them alone with Sir
      Everard Digby.&nbsp; Away they all rode again, through Warwickshire and
      Worcestershire, to a house called Holbeach, on the borders of
      Staffordshire.&nbsp; They tried to raise the Catholics on their way, but
      were indignantly driven off by them.&nbsp; All this time they were hotly
      pursued by the sheriff of Worcester, and a fast increasing concourse of
      riders.&nbsp; At last, resolving to defend themselves at Holbeach, they
      shut themselves up in the house, and put some wet powder before the fire
      to dry.&nbsp; But it blew up, and Catesby was singed and blackened, and
      almost killed, and some of the others were sadly hurt.&nbsp; Still,
      knowing that they must die, they resolved to die there, and with only
      their swords in their hands appeared at the windows to be shot at by the
      sheriff and his assistants.&nbsp; Catesby said to Thomas Winter, after
      Thomas had been hit in the right arm which dropped powerless by his side,
      &lsquo;Stand by me, Tom, and we will die together!&rsquo;&mdash;which they
      did, being shot through the body by two bullets from one gun.&nbsp; John
      Wright, and Christopher Wright, and Percy, were also shot.&nbsp; Rookwood
      and Digby were taken: the former with a broken arm and a wound in his body
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the fifteenth of January, before the trial of Guy Fawkes, and such
      of the other conspirators as were left alive, came on.&nbsp; They were all
      found guilty, all hanged, drawn, and quartered: some, in St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Churchyard, on the top of Ludgate-hill; some, before the Parliament House.&nbsp;
      A Jesuit priest, named <span class="smcap">Henry Garnet</span>, to whom
      the dreadful design was said to have been communicated, was taken and
      tried; and two of his servants, as well as a poor priest who was taken
      with him, were tortured without mercy.&nbsp; He himself was not tortured,
      but was surrounded in the Tower by tamperers and traitors, and so was made
      unfairly to convict himself out of his own mouth.&nbsp; He said, upon his
      trial, that he had done all he could to prevent the deed, and that he
      could not make public what had been told him in confession&mdash;though I
      am afraid he knew of the plot in other ways.&nbsp; He was found guilty and
      executed, after a manful defence, and the Catholic Church made a saint of
      him; some rich and powerful persons, who had had nothing to do with the
      project, were fined and imprisoned for it by the Star Chamber; the
      Catholics, in general, who had recoiled with horror from the idea of the
      infernal contrivance, were unjustly put under more severe laws than
      before; and this was the end of the Gunpowder Plot.
    </p>
    <h3>
      SECOND PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      His Sowship would pretty willingly, I think, have blown the House of
      Commons into the air himself; for, his dread and jealousy of it knew no
      bounds all through his reign.&nbsp; When he was hard pressed for money he
      was obliged to order it to meet, as he could get no money without it; and
      when it asked him first to abolish some of the monopolies in necessaries
      of life which were a great grievance to the people, and to redress other
      public wrongs, he flew into a rage and got rid of it again.&nbsp; At one
      time he wanted it to consent to the Union of England with Scotland, and
      quarrelled about that.&nbsp; At another time it wanted him to put down a
      most infamous Church abuse, called the High Commission Court, and he
      quarrelled with it about that.&nbsp; At another time it entreated him not
      to be quite so fond of his archbishops and bishops who made speeches in
      his praise too awful to be related, but to have some little consideration
      for the poor Puritan clergy who were persecuted for preaching in their own
      way, and not according to the archbishops and bishops; and they quarrelled
      about that.&nbsp; In short, what with hating the House of Commons, and
      pretending not to hate it; and what with now sending some of its members
      who opposed him, to Newgate or to the Tower, and now telling the rest that
      they must not presume to make speeches about the public affairs which
      could not possibly concern them; and what with cajoling, and bullying, and
      fighting, and being frightened; the House of Commons was the plague of his
      Sowship&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; It was pretty firm, however, in
      maintaining its rights, and insisting that the Parliament should make the
      laws, and not the King by his own single proclamations (which he tried
      hard to do); and his Sowship was so often distressed for money, in
      consequence, that he sold every sort of title and public office as if they
      were merchandise, and even invented a new dignity called a Baronetcy,
      which anybody could buy for a thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      These disputes with his Parliaments, and his hunting, and his drinking,
      and his lying in bed&mdash;for he was a great sluggard&mdash;occupied his
      Sowship pretty well.&nbsp; The rest of his time he chiefly passed in
      hugging and slobbering his favourites.&nbsp; The first of these was <span
      class="smcap">Sir Philip Herbert</span>, who had no knowledge whatever,
      except of dogs, and horses, and hunting, but whom he soon made <span
      class="smcap">Earl of Montgomery</span>.&nbsp; The next, and a much more
      famous one, was <span class="smcap">Robert Carr</span>, or <span
      class="smcap">Ker</span> (for it is not certain which was his right name),
      who came from the Border country, and whom he soon made <span class="smcap">Viscount
      Rochester</span>, and afterwards, <span class="smcap">Earl of Somerset</span>.&nbsp;
      The way in which his Sowship doted on this handsome young man, is even
      more odious to think of, than the way in which the really great men of
      England condescended to bow down before him.&nbsp; The favourite&rsquo;s
      great friend was a certain <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Overbury</span>,
      who wrote his love-letters for him, and assisted him in the duties of his
      many high places, which his own ignorance prevented him from discharging.&nbsp;
      But this same Sir Thomas having just manhood enough to dissuade the
      favourite from a wicked marriage with the beautiful Countess of Essex, who
      was to get a divorce from her husband for the purpose, the said Countess,
      in her rage, got Sir Thomas put into the Tower, and there poisoned him.&nbsp;
      Then the favourite and this bad woman were publicly married by the King&rsquo;s
      pet bishop, with as much to-do and rejoicing, as if he had been the best
      man, and she the best woman, upon the face of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after a longer sunshine than might have been expected&mdash;of seven
      years or so, that is to say&mdash;another handsome young man started up
      and eclipsed the <span class="smcap">Earl of Somerset</span>.&nbsp; This
      was <span class="smcap">George Villiers</span>, the youngest son of a
      Leicestershire gentleman: who came to Court with all the Paris fashions on
      him, and could dance as well as the best mountebank that ever was seen.&nbsp;
      He soon danced himself into the good graces of his Sowship, and danced the
      other favourite out of favour.&nbsp; Then, it was all at once discovered
      that the Earl and Countess of Somerset had not deserved all those great
      promotions and mighty rejoicings, and they were separately tried for the
      murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and for other crimes.&nbsp; But, the King
      was so afraid of his late favourite&rsquo;s publicly telling some
      disgraceful things he knew of him&mdash;which he darkly threatened to do&mdash;that
      he was even examined with two men standing, one on either side of him,
      each with a cloak in his hand, ready to throw it over his head and stop
      his mouth if he should break out with what he had it in his power to tell.&nbsp;
      So, a very lame affair was purposely made of the trial, and his punishment
      was an allowance of four thousand pounds a year in retirement, while the
      Countess was pardoned, and allowed to pass into retirement too.&nbsp; They
      hated one another by this time, and lived to revile and torment each other
      some years.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these events were in progress, and while his Sowship was making such
      an exhibition of himself, from day to day and from year to year, as is not
      often seen in any sty, three remarkable deaths took place in England.&nbsp;
      The first was that of the Minister, Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, who
      was past sixty, and had never been strong, being deformed from his birth.&nbsp;
      He said at last that he had no wish to live; and no Minister need have
      had, with his experience of the meanness and wickedness of those
      disgraceful times.&nbsp; The second was that of the Lady Arabella Stuart,
      who alarmed his Sowship mightily, by privately marrying <span class="smcap">William
      Seymour</span>, son of <span class="smcap">Lord Beauchamp</span>, who was
      a descendant of King Henry the Seventh, and who, his Sowship thought,
      might consequently increase and strengthen any claim she might one day set
      up to the throne.&nbsp; She was separated from her husband (who was put in
      the Tower) and thrust into a boat to be confined at Durham.&nbsp; She
      escaped in a man&rsquo;s dress to get away in a French ship from Gravesend
      to France, but unhappily missed her husband, who had escaped too, and was
      soon taken.&nbsp; She went raving mad in the miserable Tower, and died
      there after four years.&nbsp; The last, and the most important of these
      three deaths, was that of Prince Henry, the heir to the throne, in the
      nineteenth year of his age.&nbsp; He was a promising young prince, and
      greatly liked; a quiet, well-conducted youth, of whom two very good things
      are known: first, that his father was jealous of him; secondly, that he
      was the friend of Sir Walter Raleigh, languishing through all those years
      in the Tower, and often said that no man but his father would keep such a
      bird in such a cage.&nbsp; On the occasion of the preparations for the
      marriage of his sister the Princess Elizabeth with a foreign prince (and
      an unhappy marriage it turned out), he came from Richmond, where he had
      been very ill, to greet his new brother-in-law, at the palace at
      Whitehall.&nbsp; There he played a great game at tennis, in his shirt,
      though it was very cold weather, and was seized with an alarming illness,
      and died within a fortnight of a putrid fever.&nbsp; For this young prince
      Sir Walter Raleigh wrote, in his prison in the Tower, the beginning of a
      History of the World: a wonderful instance how little his Sowship could do
      to confine a great man&rsquo;s mind, however long he might imprison his
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this mention of Sir Walter Raleigh, who had many faults, but who never
      showed so many merits as in trouble and adversity, may bring me at once to
      the end of his sad story.&nbsp; After an imprisonment in the Tower of
      twelve long years, he proposed to resume those old sea voyages of his, and
      to go to South America in search of gold.&nbsp; His Sowship, divided
      between his wish to be on good terms with the Spaniards through whose
      territory Sir Walter must pass (he had long had an idea of marrying Prince
      Henry to a Spanish Princess), and his avaricious eagerness to get hold of
      the gold, did not know what to do.&nbsp; But, in the end, he set Sir
      Walter free, taking securities for his return; and Sir Walter fitted out
      an expedition at his own coast and, on the twenty-eighth of March, one
      thousand six hundred and seventeen, sailed away in command of one of its
      ships, which he ominously called the Destiny.&nbsp; The expedition failed;
      the common men, not finding the gold they had expected, mutinied; a
      quarrel broke out between Sir Walter and the Spaniards, who hated him for
      old successes of his against them; and he took and burnt a little town
      called <span class="smcap">Saint Thomas</span>.&nbsp; For this he was
      denounced to his Sowship by the Spanish Ambassador as a pirate; and
      returning almost broken-hearted, with his hopes and fortunes shattered,
      his company of friends dispersed, and his brave son (who had been one of
      them) killed, he was taken&mdash;through the treachery of <span
      class="smcap">Sir Lewis Stukely</span>, his near relation, a scoundrel and
      a Vice-Admiral&mdash;and was once again immured in his prison-home of so
      many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Sowship being mightily disappointed in not getting any gold, Sir
      Walter Raleigh was tried as unfairly, and with as many lies and evasions
      as the judges and law officers and every other authority in Church and
      State habitually practised under such a King.&nbsp; After a great deal of
      prevarication on all parts but his own, it was declared that he must die
      under his former sentence, now fifteen years old.&nbsp; So, on the
      twenty-eighth of October, one thousand six hundred and eighteen, he was
      shut up in the Gate House at Westminster to pass his late night on earth,
      and there he took leave of his good and faithful lady who was worthy to
      have lived in better days.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock next morning,
      after a cheerful breakfast, and a pipe, and a cup of good wine, he was
      taken to Old Palace Yard in Westminster, where the scaffold was set up,
      and where so many people of high degree were assembled to see him die,
      that it was a matter of some difficulty to get him through the crowd.&nbsp;
      He behaved most nobly, but if anything lay heavy on his mind, it was that
      Earl of Essex, whose head he had seen roll off; and he solemnly said that
      he had had no hand in bringing him to the block, and that he had shed
      tears for him when he died.&nbsp; As the morning was very cold, the
      Sheriff said, would he come down to a fire for a little space, and warm
      himself?&nbsp; But Sir Walter thanked him, and said no, he would rather it
      were done at once, for he was ill of fever and ague, and in another
      quarter of an hour his shaking fit would come upon him if he were still
      alive, and his enemies might then suppose that he trembled for fear.&nbsp;
      With that, he kneeled and made a very beautiful and Christian prayer.&nbsp;
      Before he laid his head upon the block he felt the edge of the axe, and
      said, with a smile upon his face, that it was a sharp medicine, but would
      cure the worst disease.&nbsp; When he was bent down ready for death, he
      said to the executioner, finding that he hesitated, &lsquo;What dost thou
      fear?&nbsp; Strike, man!&rsquo;&nbsp; So, the axe came down and struck his
      head off, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new favourite got on fast.&nbsp; He was made a viscount, he was made
      Duke of Buckingham, he was made a marquis, he was made Master of the
      Horse, he was made Lord High Admiral&mdash;and the Chief Commander of the
      gallant English forces that had dispersed the Spanish Armada, was
      displaced to make room for him.&nbsp; He had the whole kingdom at his
      disposal, and his mother sold all the profits and honours of the State, as
      if she had kept a shop.&nbsp; He blazed all over with diamonds and other
      precious stones, from his hatband and his earrings to his shoes.&nbsp; Yet
      he was an ignorant presumptuous, swaggering compound of knave and fool,
      with nothing but his beauty and his dancing to recommend him.&nbsp; This
      is the gentleman who called himself his Majesty&rsquo;s dog and slave, and
      called his Majesty Your Sowship.&nbsp; His Sowship called him <span
      class="smcap">Steenie</span>; it is supposed, because that was a nickname
      for Stephen, and because St. Stephen was generally represented in pictures
      as a handsome saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Sowship was driven sometimes to his wits&rsquo;-end by his trimming
      between the general dislike of the Catholic religion at home, and his
      desire to wheedle and flatter it abroad, as his only means of getting a
      rich princess for his son&rsquo;s wife: a part of whose fortune he might
      cram into his greasy pockets.&nbsp; Prince Charles&mdash;or as his Sowship
      called him, Baby Charles&mdash;being now <span class="smcap">Prince of
      Wales</span>, the old project of a marriage with the Spanish King&rsquo;s
      daughter had been revived for him; and as she could not marry a Protestant
      without leave from the Pope, his Sowship himself secretly and meanly wrote
      to his Infallibility, asking for it.&nbsp; The negotiation for this
      Spanish marriage takes up a larger space in great books, than you can
      imagine, but the upshot of it all is, that when it had been held off by
      the Spanish Court for a long time, Baby Charles and Steenie set off in
      disguise as Mr. Thomas Smith and Mr. John Smith, to see the Spanish
      Princess; that Baby Charles pretended to be desperately in love with her,
      and jumped off walls to look at her, and made a considerable fool of
      himself in a good many ways; that she was called Princess of Wales and
      that the whole Spanish Court believed Baby Charles to be all but dying for
      her sake, as he expressly told them he was; that Baby Charles and Steenie
      came back to England, and were received with as much rapture as if they
      had been a blessing to it; that Baby Charles had actually fallen in love
      with <span class="smcap">Henrietta Maria</span>, the French King&rsquo;s
      sister, whom he had seen in Paris; that he thought it a wonderfully fine
      and princely thing to have deceived the Spaniards, all through; and that
      he openly said, with a chuckle, as soon as he was safe and sound at home
      again, that the Spaniards were great fools to have believed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most dishonest men, the Prince and the favourite complained that the
      people whom they had deluded were dishonest.&nbsp; They made such
      misrepresentations of the treachery of the Spaniards in this business of
      the Spanish match, that the English nation became eager for a war with
      them.&nbsp; Although the gravest Spaniards laughed at the idea of his
      Sowship in a warlike attitude, the Parliament granted money for the
      beginning of hostilities, and the treaties with Spain were publicly
      declared to be at an end.&nbsp; The Spanish ambassador in London&mdash;probably
      with the help of the fallen favourite, the Earl of Somerset&mdash;being
      unable to obtain speech with his Sowship, slipped a paper into his hand,
      declaring that he was a prisoner in his own house, and was entirely
      governed by Buckingham and his creatures.&nbsp; The first effect of this
      letter was that his Sowship began to cry and whine, and took Baby Charles
      away from Steenie, and went down to Windsor, gabbling all sorts of
      nonsense.&nbsp; The end of it was that his Sowship hugged his dog and
      slave, and said he was quite satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had given the Prince and the favourite almost unlimited power to settle
      anything with the Pope as to the Spanish marriage; and he now, with a view
      to the French one, signed a treaty that all Roman Catholics in England
      should exercise their religion freely, and should never be required to
      take any oath contrary thereto.&nbsp; In return for this, and for other
      concessions much less to be defended, Henrietta Maria was to become the
      Prince&rsquo;s wife, and was to bring him a fortune of eight hundred
      thousand crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Sowship&rsquo;s eyes were getting red with eagerly looking for the
      money, when the end of a gluttonous life came upon him; and, after a
      fortnight&rsquo;s illness, on Sunday the twenty-seventh of March, one
      thousand six hundred and twenty-five, he died.&nbsp; He had reigned
      twenty-two years, and was fifty-nine years old.&nbsp; I know of nothing
      more abominable in history than the adulation that was lavished on this
      King, and the vice and corruption that such a barefaced habit of lying
      produced in his court.&nbsp; It is much to be doubted whether one man of
      honour, and not utterly self-disgraced, kept his place near James the
      First.&nbsp; Lord Bacon, that able and wise philosopher, as the First
      Judge in the Kingdom in this reign, became a public spectacle of
      dishonesty and corruption; and in his base flattery of his Sowship, and in
      his crawling servility to his dog and slave, disgraced himself even more.&nbsp;
      But, a creature like his Sowship set upon a throne is like the Plague, and
      everybody receives infection from him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Baby Charles became <span class="smcap">King Charles the First</span>, in
      the twenty-fifth year of his age.&nbsp; Unlike his father, he was usually
      amiable in his private character, and grave and dignified in his bearing;
      but, like his father, he had monstrously exaggerated notions of the rights
      of a king, and was evasive, and not to be trusted.&nbsp; If his word could
      have been relied upon, his history might have had a different end.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first care was to send over that insolent upstart, Buckingham, to
      bring Henrietta Maria from Paris to be his Queen; upon which occasion
      Buckingham&mdash;with his usual audacity&mdash;made love to the young
      Queen of Austria, and was very indignant indeed with <span class="smcap">Cardinal
      Richelieu</span>, the French Minister, for thwarting his intentions.&nbsp;
      The English people were very well disposed to like their new Queen, and to
      receive her with great favour when she came among them as a stranger.&nbsp;
      But, she held the Protestant religion in great dislike, and brought over a
      crowd of unpleasant priests, who made her do some very ridiculous things,
      and forced themselves upon the public notice in many disagreeable ways.&nbsp;
      Hence, the people soon came to dislike her, and she soon came to dislike
      them; and she did so much all through this reign in setting the King (who
      was dotingly fond of her) against his subjects, that it would have been
      better for him if she had never been born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you are to understand that King Charles the First&mdash;of his own
      determination to be a high and mighty King not to be called to account by
      anybody, and urged on by his Queen besides&mdash;deliberately set himself
      to put his Parliament down and to put himself up. You are also to
      understand, that even in pursuit of this wrong idea (enough in itself to
      have ruined any king) he never took a straight course, but always took a
      crooked one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was bent upon war with Spain, though neither the House of Commons nor
      the people were quite clear as to the justice of that war, now that they
      began to think a little more about the story of the Spanish match.&nbsp;
      But the King rushed into it hotly, raised money by illegal means to meet
      its expenses, and encountered a miserable failure at Cadiz, in the very
      first year of his reign.&nbsp; An expedition to Cadiz had been made in the
      hope of plunder, but as it was not successful, it was necessary to get a
      grant of money from the Parliament; and when they met, in no very
      complying humour, the King told them, &lsquo;to make haste to let him have
      it, or it would be the worse for themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not put in a
      more complying humour by this, they impeached the King&rsquo;s favourite,
      the Duke of Buckingham, as the cause (which he undoubtedly was) of many
      great public grievances and wrongs.&nbsp; The King, to save him, dissolved
      the Parliament without getting the money he wanted; and when the Lords
      implored him to consider and grant a little delay, he replied, &lsquo;No,
      not one minute.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then began to raise money for himself by
      the following means among others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He levied certain duties called tonnage and poundage which had not been
      granted by the Parliament, and could lawfully be levied by no other power;
      he called upon the seaport towns to furnish, and to pay all the cost for
      three months of, a fleet of armed ships; and he required the people to
      unite in lending him large sums of money, the repayment of which was very
      doubtful.&nbsp; If the poor people refused, they were pressed as soldiers
      or sailors; if the gentry refused, they were sent to prison.&nbsp; Five
      gentlemen, named <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Darnel</span>, <span
      class="smcap">John Corbet</span>, <span class="smcap">Walter Earl</span>,
      <span class="smcap">John Heveningham</span>, and <span class="smcap">Everard
      Hampden</span>, for refusing were taken up by a warrant of the King&rsquo;s
      privy council, and were sent to prison without any cause but the King&rsquo;s
      pleasure being stated for their imprisonment.&nbsp; Then the question came
      to be solemnly tried, whether this was not a violation of Magna Charta,
      and an encroachment by the King on the highest rights of the English
      people.&nbsp; His lawyers contended No, because to encroach upon the
      rights of the English people would be to do wrong, and the King could do
      no wrong.&nbsp; The accommodating judges decided in favour of this wicked
      nonsense; and here was a fatal division between the King and the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all this, it became necessary to call another Parliament.&nbsp; The
      people, sensible of the danger in which their liberties were, chose for it
      those who were best known for their determined opposition to the King; but
      still the King, quite blinded by his determination to carry everything
      before him, addressed them when they met, in a contemptuous manner, and
      just told them in so many words that he had only called them together
      because he wanted money.&nbsp; The Parliament, strong enough and resolute
      enough to know that they would lower his tone, cared little for what he
      said, and laid before him one of the great documents of history, which is
      called the <span class="smcap">Petition of Right</span>, requiring that
      the free men of England should no longer be called upon to lend the King
      money, and should no longer be pressed or imprisoned for refusing to do
      so; further, that the free men of England should no longer be seized by
      the King&rsquo;s special mandate or warrant, it being contrary to their
      rights and liberties and the laws of their country.&nbsp; At first the
      King returned an answer to this petition, in which he tried to shirk it
      altogether; but, the House of Commons then showing their determination to
      go on with the impeachment of Buckingham, the King in alarm returned an
      answer, giving his consent to all that was required of him.&nbsp; He not
      only afterwards departed from his word and honour on these points, over
      and over again, but, at this very time, he did the mean and dissembling
      act of publishing his first answer and not his second&mdash;merely that
      the people might suppose that the Parliament had not got the better of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That pestilent Buckingham, to gratify his own wounded vanity, had by this
      time involved the country in war with France, as well as with Spain.&nbsp;
      For such miserable causes and such miserable creatures are wars sometimes
      made!&nbsp; But he was destined to do little more mischief in this world.&nbsp;
      One morning, as he was going out of his house to his carriage, he turned
      to speak to a certain Colonel <span class="smcap">Fryer</span> who was
      with him; and he was violently stabbed with a knife, which the murderer
      left sticking in his heart.&nbsp; This happened in his hall.&nbsp; He had
      had angry words up-stairs, just before, with some French gentlemen, who
      were immediately suspected by his servants, and had a close escape from
      being set upon and killed.&nbsp; In the midst of the noise, the real
      murderer, who had gone to the kitchen and might easily have got away, drew
      his sword and cried out, &lsquo;I am the man!&rsquo;&nbsp; His name was
      <span class="smcap">John Felton</span>, a Protestant and a retired officer
      in the army.&nbsp; He said he had had no personal ill-will to the Duke,
      but had killed him as a curse to the country.&nbsp; He had aimed his blow
      well, for Buckingham had only had time to cry out, &lsquo;Villain!&rsquo;
      and then he drew out the knife, fell against a table, and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The council made a mighty business of examining John Felton about this
      murder, though it was a plain case enough, one would think.&nbsp; He had
      come seventy miles to do it, he told them, and he did it for the reason he
      had declared; if they put him upon the rack, as that noble <span
      class="smcap">Marquis of Dorset</span> whom he saw before him, had the
      goodness to threaten, he gave that marquis warning, that he would accuse
      <i>him</i> as his accomplice!&nbsp; The King was unpleasantly anxious to
      have him racked, nevertheless; but as the judges now found out that
      torture was contrary to the law of England&mdash;it is a pity they did not
      make the discovery a little sooner&mdash;John Felton was simply executed
      for the murder he had done.&nbsp; A murder it undoubtedly was, and not in
      the least to be defended: though he had freed England from one of the most
      profligate, contemptible, and base court favourites to whom it has ever
      yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very different man now arose.&nbsp; This was <span class="smcap">Sir
      Thomas Wentworth</span>, a Yorkshire gentleman, who had sat in Parliament
      for a long time, and who had favoured arbitrary and haughty principles,
      but who had gone over to the people&rsquo;s side on receiving offence from
      Buckingham.&nbsp; The King, much wanting such a man&mdash;for, besides
      being naturally favourable to the King&rsquo;s cause, he had great
      abilities&mdash;made him first a Baron, and then a Viscount, and gave him
      high employment, and won him most completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Parliament, however, was still in existence, and was <i>not</i> to be
      won.&nbsp; On the twentieth of January, one thousand six hundred and
      twenty-nine, <span class="smcap">Sir John Eliot</span>, a great man who
      had been active in the Petition of Right, brought forward other strong
      resolutions against the King&rsquo;s chief instruments, and called upon
      the Speaker to put them to the vote.&nbsp; To this the Speaker answered,
      &lsquo;he was commanded otherwise by the King,&rsquo; and got up to leave
      the chair&mdash;which, according to the rules of the House of Commons
      would have obliged it to adjourn without doing anything more&mdash;when
      two members, named Mr. <span class="smcap">Hollis</span> and Mr. <span
      class="smcap">Valentine</span>, held him down.&nbsp; A scene of great
      confusion arose among the members; and while many swords were drawn and
      flashing about, the King, who was kept informed of all that was going on,
      told the captain of his guard to go down to the House and force the doors.&nbsp;
      The resolutions were by that time, however, voted, and the House
      adjourned.&nbsp; Sir John Eliot and those two members who had held the
      Speaker down, were quickly summoned before the council.&nbsp; As they
      claimed it to be their privilege not to answer out of Parliament for
      anything they had said in it, they were committed to the Tower.&nbsp; The
      King then went down and dissolved the Parliament, in a speech wherein he
      made mention of these gentlemen as &lsquo;Vipers&rsquo;&mdash;which did
      not do him much good that ever I have heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they refused to gain their liberty by saying they were sorry for what
      they had done, the King, always remarkably unforgiving, never overlooked
      their offence.&nbsp; When they demanded to be brought up before the court
      of King&rsquo;s Bench, he even resorted to the meanness of having them
      moved about from prison to prison, so that the writs issued for that
      purpose should not legally find them.&nbsp; At last they came before the
      court and were sentenced to heavy fines, and to be imprisoned during the
      King&rsquo;s pleasure.&nbsp; When Sir John Eliot&rsquo;s health had quite
      given way, and he so longed for change of air and scene as to petition for
      his release, the King sent back the answer (worthy of his Sowship himself)
      that the petition was not humble enough.&nbsp; When he sent another
      petition by his young son, in which he pathetically offered to go back to
      prison when his health was restored, if he might be released for its
      recovery, the King still disregarded it.&nbsp; When he died in the Tower,
      and his children petitioned to be allowed to take his body down to
      Cornwall, there to lay it among the ashes of his forefathers, the King
      returned for answer, &lsquo;Let Sir John Eliot&rsquo;s body be buried in
      the church of that parish where he died.&rsquo;&nbsp; All this was like a
      very little King indeed, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, for twelve long years, steadily pursuing his design of setting
      himself up and putting the people down, the King called no Parliament; but
      ruled without one.&nbsp; If twelve thousand volumes were written in his
      praise (as a good many have been) it would still remain a fact, impossible
      to be denied, that for twelve years King Charles the First reigned in
      England unlawfully and despotically, seized upon his subjects&rsquo; goods
      and money at his pleasure, and punished according to his unbridled will
      all who ventured to oppose him.&nbsp; It is a fashion with some people to
      think that this King&rsquo;s career was cut short; but I must say myself
      that I think he ran a pretty long one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">William Laud</span>, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the
      King&rsquo;s right-hand man in the religious part of the putting down of
      the people&rsquo;s liberties.&nbsp; Laud, who was a sincere man, of large
      learning but small sense&mdash;for the two things sometimes go together in
      very different quantities&mdash;though a Protestant, held opinions so near
      those of the Catholics, that the Pope wanted to make a Cardinal of him, if
      he would have accepted that favour.&nbsp; He looked upon vows, robes,
      lighted candles, images, and so forth, as amazingly important in religious
      ceremonies; and he brought in an immensity of bowing and candle-snuffing.&nbsp;
      He also regarded archbishops and bishops as a sort of miraculous persons,
      and was inveterate in the last degree against any who thought otherwise.&nbsp;
      Accordingly, he offered up thanks to Heaven, and was in a state of much
      pious pleasure, when a Scotch clergyman, named <span class="smcap">Leighton</span>,
      was pilloried, whipped, branded in the cheek, and had one of his ears cut
      off and one of his nostrils slit, for calling bishops trumpery and the
      inventions of men.&nbsp; He originated on a Sunday morning the prosecution
      of <span class="smcap">William Prynne</span>, a barrister who was of
      similar opinions, and who was fined a thousand pounds; who was pilloried;
      who had his ears cut off on two occasions&mdash;one ear at a time&mdash;and
      who was imprisoned for life.&nbsp; He highly approved of the punishment of
      <span class="smcap">Doctor Bastwick</span>, a physician; who was also
      fined a thousand pounds; and who afterwards had <i>his</i> ears cut off,
      and was imprisoned for life.&nbsp; These were gentle methods of
      persuasion, some will tell you: I think, they were rather calculated to be
      alarming to the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the money part of the putting down of the people&rsquo;s liberties, the
      King was equally gentle, as some will tell you: as I think, equally
      alarming.&nbsp; He levied those duties of tonnage and poundage, and
      increased them as he thought fit.&nbsp; He granted monopolies to companies
      of merchants on their paying him for them, notwithstanding the great
      complaints that had, for years and years, been made on the subject of
      monopolies.&nbsp; He fined the people for disobeying proclamations issued
      by his Sowship in direct violation of law.&nbsp; He revived the detested
      Forest laws, and took private property to himself as his forest right.&nbsp;
      Above all, he determined to have what was called Ship Money; that is to
      say, money for the support of the fleet&mdash;not only from the seaports,
      but from all the counties of England: having found out that, in some
      ancient time or other, all the counties paid it.&nbsp; The grievance of
      this ship money being somewhat too strong, <span class="smcap">John
      Chambers</span>, a citizen of London, refused to pay his part of it.&nbsp;
      For this the Lord Mayor ordered John Chambers to prison, and for that John
      Chambers brought a suit against the Lord Mayor.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lord
      Say</span>, also, behaved like a real nobleman, and declared he would not
      pay.&nbsp; But, the sturdiest and best opponent of the ship money was
      <span class="smcap">John Hampden</span>, a gentleman of Buckinghamshire,
      who had sat among the &lsquo;vipers&rsquo; in the House of Commons when
      there was such a thing, and who had been the bosom friend of Sir John
      Eliot.&nbsp; This case was tried before the twelve judges in the Court of
      Exchequer, and again the King&rsquo;s lawyers said it was impossible that
      ship money could be wrong, because the King could do no wrong, however
      hard he tried&mdash;and he really did try very hard during these twelve
      years.&nbsp; Seven of the judges said that was quite true, and Mr. Hampden
      was bound to pay: five of the judges said that was quite false, and Mr.
      Hampden was not bound to pay.&nbsp; So, the King triumphed (as he
      thought), by making Hampden the most popular man in England; where matters
      were getting to that height now, that many honest Englishmen could not
      endure their country, and sailed away across the seas to found a colony in
      Massachusetts Bay in America.&nbsp; It is said that Hampden himself and
      his relation <span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span> were going with a
      company of such voyagers, and were actually on board ship, when they were
      stopped by a proclamation, prohibiting sea captains to carry out such
      passengers without the royal license.&nbsp; But O! it would have been well
      for the King if he had let them go!&nbsp; This was the state of England.&nbsp;
      If Laud had been a madman just broke loose, he could not have done more
      mischief than he did in Scotland.&nbsp; In his endeavours (in which he was
      seconded by the King, then in person in that part of his dominions) to
      force his own ideas of bishops, and his own religious forms and ceremonies
      upon the Scotch, he roused that nation to a perfect frenzy.&nbsp; They
      formed a solemn league, which they called The Covenant, for the
      preservation of their own religious forms; they rose in arms throughout
      the whole country; they summoned all their men to prayers and sermons
      twice a day by beat of drum; they sang psalms, in which they compared
      their enemies to all the evil spirits that ever were heard of; and they
      solemnly vowed to smite them with the sword.&nbsp; At first the King tried
      force, then treaty, then a Scottish Parliament which did not answer at
      all.&nbsp; Then he tried the <span class="smcap">Earl of Strafford</span>,
      formerly Sir Thomas Wentworth; who, as <span class="smcap">Lord Wentworth</span>,
      had been governing Ireland.&nbsp; He, too, had carried it with a very high
      hand there, though to the benefit and prosperity of that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strafford and Laud were for conquering the Scottish people by force of
      arms.&nbsp; Other lords who were taken into council, recommended that a
      Parliament should at last be called; to which the King unwillingly
      consented.&nbsp; So, on the thirteenth of April, one thousand six hundred
      and forty, that then strange sight, a Parliament, was seen at Westminster.&nbsp;
      It is called the Short Parliament, for it lasted a very little while.&nbsp;
      While the members were all looking at one another, doubtful who would dare
      to speak, <span class="smcap">Mr. Pym</span> arose and set forth all that
      the King had done unlawfully during the past twelve years, and what was
      the position to which England was reduced.&nbsp; This great example set,
      other members took courage and spoke the truth freely, though with great
      patience and moderation.&nbsp; The King, a little frightened, sent to say
      that if they would grant him a certain sum on certain terms, no more ship
      money should be raised.&nbsp; They debated the matter for two days; and
      then, as they would not give him all he asked without promise or inquiry,
      he dissolved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they knew very well that he must have a Parliament now; and he began
      to make that discovery too, though rather late in the day.&nbsp;
      Wherefore, on the twenty-fourth of September, being then at York with an
      army collected against the Scottish people, but his own men sullen and
      discontented like the rest of the nation, the King told the great council
      of the Lords, whom he had called to meet him there, that he would summon
      another Parliament to assemble on the third of November.&nbsp; The
      soldiers of the Covenant had now forced their way into England and had
      taken possession of the northern counties, where the coals are got.&nbsp;
      As it would never do to be without coals, and as the King&rsquo;s troops
      could make no head against the Covenanters so full of gloomy zeal, a truce
      was made, and a treaty with Scotland was taken into consideration.&nbsp;
      Meanwhile the northern counties paid the Covenanters to leave the coals
      alone, and keep quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now disposed of the Short Parliament.&nbsp; We have next to see
      what memorable things were done by the Long one.
    </p>
    <h3>
      SECOND PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Long Parliament assembled on the third of November, one thousand six
      hundred and forty-one.&nbsp; That day week the Earl of Strafford arrived
      from York, very sensible that the spirited and determined men who formed
      that Parliament were no friends towards him, who had not only deserted the
      cause of the people, but who had on all occasions opposed himself to their
      liberties.&nbsp; The King told him, for his comfort, that the Parliament
      &lsquo;should not hurt one hair of his head.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, on the very
      next day Mr. Pym, in the House of Commons, and with great solemnity,
      impeached the Earl of Strafford as a traitor.&nbsp; He was immediately
      taken into custody and fell from his proud height.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the twenty-second of March before he was brought to trial in
      Westminster Hall; where, although he was very ill and suffered great pain,
      he defended himself with such ability and majesty, that it was doubtful
      whether he would not get the best of it.&nbsp; But on the thirteenth day
      of the trial, Pym produced in the House of Commons a copy of some notes of
      a council, found by young <span class="smcap">Sir Harry Vane</span> in a
      red velvet cabinet belonging to his father (Secretary Vane, who sat at the
      council-table with the Earl), in which Strafford had distinctly told the
      King that he was free from all rules and obligations of government, and
      might do with his people whatever he liked; and in which he had added&mdash;&lsquo;You
      have an army in Ireland that you may employ to reduce this kingdom to
      obedience.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not clear whether by the words &lsquo;this
      kingdom,&rsquo; he had really meant England or Scotland; but the
      Parliament contended that he meant England, and this was treason.&nbsp; At
      the same sitting of the House of Commons it was resolved to bring in a
      bill of attainder declaring the treason to have been committed: in
      preference to proceeding with the trial by impeachment, which would have
      required the treason to be proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, a bill was brought in at once, was carried through the House of
      Commons by a large majority, and was sent up to the House of Lords.&nbsp;
      While it was still uncertain whether the House of Lords would pass it and
      the King consent to it, Pym disclosed to the House of Commons that the
      King and Queen had both been plotting with the officers of the army to
      bring up the soldiers and control the Parliament, and also to introduce
      two hundred soldiers into the Tower of London to effect the Earl&rsquo;s
      escape.&nbsp; The plotting with the army was revealed by one <span
      class="smcap">George Goring</span>, the son of a lord of that name: a bad
      fellow who was one of the original plotters, and turned traitor.&nbsp; The
      King had actually given his warrant for the admission of the two hundred
      men into the Tower, and they would have got in too, but for the refusal of
      the governor&mdash;a sturdy Scotchman of the name of <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>&mdash;to
      admit them.&nbsp; These matters being made public, great numbers of people
      began to riot outside the Houses of Parliament, and to cry out for the
      execution of the Earl of Strafford, as one of the King&rsquo;s chief
      instruments against them.&nbsp; The bill passed the House of Lords while
      the people were in this state of agitation, and was laid before the King
      for his assent, together with another bill declaring that the Parliament
      then assembled should not be dissolved or adjourned without their own
      consent.&nbsp; The King&mdash;not unwilling to save a faithful servant,
      though he had no great attachment for him&mdash;was in some doubt what to
      do; but he gave his consent to both bills, although he in his heart
      believed that the bill against the Earl of Strafford was unlawful and
      unjust.&nbsp; The Earl had written to him, telling him that he was willing
      to die for his sake.&nbsp; But he had not expected that his royal master
      would take him at his word quite so readily; for, when he heard his doom,
      he laid his hand upon his heart, and said, &lsquo;Put not your trust in
      Princes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, who never could be straightforward and plain, through one single
      day or through one single sheet of paper, wrote a letter to the Lords, and
      sent it by the young Prince of Wales, entreating them to prevail with the
      Commons that &lsquo;that unfortunate man should fulfil the natural course
      of his life in a close imprisonment.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a postscript to the
      very same letter, he added, &lsquo;If he must die, it were charity to
      reprieve him till Saturday.&rsquo;&nbsp; If there had been any doubt of
      his fate, this weakness and meanness would have settled it.&nbsp; The very
      next day, which was the twelfth of May, he was brought out to be beheaded
      on Tower Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archbishop Laud, who had been so fond of having people&rsquo;s ears
      cropped off and their noses slit, was now confined in the Tower too; and
      when the Earl went by his window to his death, he was there, at his
      request, to give him his blessing.&nbsp; They had been great friends in
      the King&rsquo;s cause, and the Earl had written to him in the days of
      their power that he thought it would be an admirable thing to have Mr.
      Hampden publicly whipped for refusing to pay the ship money.&nbsp;
      However, those high and mighty doings were over now, and the Earl went his
      way to death with dignity and heroism.&nbsp; The governor wished him to
      get into a coach at the Tower gate, for fear the people should tear him to
      pieces; but he said it was all one to him whether he died by the axe or by
      the people&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; So, he walked, with a firm tread and a
      stately look, and sometimes pulled off his hat to them as he passed along.&nbsp;
      They were profoundly quiet.&nbsp; He made a speech on the scaffold from
      some notes he had prepared (the paper was found lying there after his head
      was struck off), and one blow of the axe killed him, in the forty-ninth
      year of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bold and daring act, the Parliament accompanied by other famous
      measures, all originating (as even this did) in the King&rsquo;s having so
      grossly and so long abused his power.&nbsp; The name of <span class="smcap">Delinquents</span>
      was applied to all sheriffs and other officers who had been concerned in
      raising the ship money, or any other money, from the people, in an
      unlawful manner; the Hampden judgment was reversed; the judges who had
      decided against Hampden were called upon to give large securities that
      they would take such consequences as Parliament might impose upon them;
      and one was arrested as he sat in High Court, and carried off to prison.&nbsp;
      Laud was impeached; the unfortunate victims whose ears had been cropped
      and whose noses had been slit, were brought out of prison in triumph; and
      a bill was passed declaring that a Parliament should be called every third
      year, and that if the King and the King&rsquo;s officers did not call it,
      the people should assemble of themselves and summon it, as of their own
      right and power.&nbsp; Great illuminations and rejoicings took place over
      all these things, and the country was wildly excited.&nbsp; That the
      Parliament took advantage of this excitement and stirred them up by every
      means, there is no doubt; but you are always to remember those twelve long
      years, during which the King had tried so hard whether he really could do
      any wrong or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time there was a great religious outcry against the right of the
      Bishops to sit in Parliament; to which the Scottish people particularly
      objected.&nbsp; The English were divided on this subject, and, partly on
      this account and partly because they had had foolish expectations that the
      Parliament would be able to take off nearly all the taxes, numbers of them
      sometimes wavered and inclined towards the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe myself, that if, at this or almost any other period of his life,
      the King could have been trusted by any man not out of his senses, he
      might have saved himself and kept his throne.&nbsp; But, on the English
      army being disbanded, he plotted with the officers again, as he had done
      before, and established the fact beyond all doubt by putting his signature
      of approval to a petition against the Parliamentary leaders, which was
      drawn up by certain officers.&nbsp; When the Scottish army was disbanded,
      he went to Edinburgh in four days&mdash;which was going very fast at that
      time&mdash;to plot again, and so darkly too, that it is difficult to
      decide what his whole object was.&nbsp; Some suppose that he wanted to
      gain over the Scottish Parliament, as he did in fact gain over, by
      presents and favours, many Scottish lords and men of power.&nbsp; Some
      think that he went to get proofs against the Parliamentary leaders in
      England of their having treasonably invited the Scottish people to come
      and help them.&nbsp; With whatever object he went to Scotland, he did
      little good by going.&nbsp; At the instigation of the <span class="smcap">Earl
      of Montrose</span>, a desperate man who was then in prison for plotting,
      he tried to kidnap three Scottish lords who escaped.&nbsp; A committee of
      the Parliament at home, who had followed to watch him, writing an account
      of this <span class="smcap">Incident</span>, as it was called, to the
      Parliament, the Parliament made a fresh stir about it; were, or feigned to
      be, much alarmed for themselves; and wrote to the <span class="smcap">Earl
      of Essex</span>, the commander-in-chief, for a guard to protect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not absolutely proved that the King plotted in Ireland besides, but
      it is very probable that he did, and that the Queen did, and that he had
      some wild hope of gaining the Irish people over to his side by favouring a
      rise among them.&nbsp; Whether or no, they did rise in a most brutal and
      savage rebellion; in which, encouraged by their priests, they committed
      such atrocities upon numbers of the English, of both sexes and of all
      ages, as nobody could believe, but for their being related on oath by
      eye-witnesses.&nbsp; Whether one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand
      Protestants were murdered in this outbreak, is uncertain; but, that it was
      as ruthless and barbarous an outbreak as ever was known among any savage
      people, is certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King came home from Scotland, determined to make a great struggle for
      his lost power.&nbsp; He believed that, through his presents and favours,
      Scotland would take no part against him; and the Lord Mayor of London
      received him with such a magnificent dinner that he thought he must have
      become popular again in England.&nbsp; It would take a good many Lord
      Mayors, however, to make a people, and the King soon found himself
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so soon, though, but that there was a great opposition in the
      Parliament to a celebrated paper put forth by Pym and Hampden and the
      rest, called &lsquo;<span class="smcap">The Remonstrance</span>,&rsquo;
      which set forth all the illegal acts that the King had ever done, but
      politely laid the blame of them on his bad advisers.&nbsp; Even when it
      was passed and presented to him, the King still thought himself strong
      enough to discharge Balfour from his command in the Tower, and to put in
      his place a man of bad character; to whom the Commons instantly objected,
      and whom he was obliged to abandon.&nbsp; At this time, the old outcry
      about the Bishops became louder than ever, and the old Archbishop of York
      was so near being murdered as he went down to the House of Lords&mdash;being
      laid hold of by the mob and violently knocked about, in return for very
      foolishly scolding a shrill boy who was yelping out &lsquo;No Bishops!&rsquo;&mdash;that
      he sent for all the Bishops who were in town, and proposed to them to sign
      a declaration that, as they could no longer without danger to their lives
      attend their duty in Parliament, they protested against the lawfulness of
      everything done in their absence.&nbsp; This they asked the King to send
      to the House of Lords, which he did.&nbsp; Then the House of Commons
      impeached the whole party of Bishops and sent them off to the Tower:
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking no warning from this; but encouraged by there being a moderate
      party in the Parliament who objected to these strong measures, the King,
      on the third of January, one thousand six hundred and forty-two, took the
      rashest step that ever was taken by mortal man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his own accord and without advice, he sent the Attorney-General to the
      House of Lords, to accuse of treason certain members of Parliament who as
      popular leaders were the most obnoxious to him; <span class="smcap">Lord
      Kimbolton</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir Arthur Haselrig</span>, <span
      class="smcap">Denzil Hollis</span>, <span class="smcap">John Pym</span>
      (they used to call him King Pym, he possessed such power and looked so
      big), <span class="smcap">John Hampden</span>, and <span class="smcap">William
      Strode</span>.&nbsp; The houses of those members he caused to be entered,
      and their papers to be sealed up.&nbsp; At the same time, he sent a
      messenger to the House of Commons demanding to have the five gentlemen who
      were members of that House immediately produced.&nbsp; To this the House
      replied that they should appear as soon as there was any legal charge
      against them, and immediately adjourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, the House of Commons send into the City to let the Lord Mayor
      know that their privileges are invaded by the King, and that there is no
      safety for anybody or anything.&nbsp; Then, when the five members are gone
      out of the way, down comes the King himself, with all his guard and from
      two to three hundred gentlemen and soldiers, of whom the greater part were
      armed.&nbsp; These he leaves in the hall; and then, with his nephew at his
      side, goes into the House, takes off his hat, and walks up to the Speaker&rsquo;s
      chair.&nbsp; The Speaker leaves it, the King stands in front of it, looks
      about him steadily for a little while, and says he has come for those five
      members.&nbsp; No one speaks, and then he calls John Pym by name.&nbsp; No
      one speaks, and then he calls Denzil Hollis by name.&nbsp; No one speaks,
      and then he asks the Speaker of the House where those five members are?&nbsp;
      The Speaker, answering on his knee, nobly replies that he is the servant
      of that House, and that he has neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak,
      anything but what the House commands him.&nbsp; Upon this, the King,
      beaten from that time evermore, replies that he will seek them himself,
      for they have committed treason; and goes out, with his hat in his hand,
      amid some audible murmurs from the members.
    </p>
    <p>
      No words can describe the hurry that arose out of doors when all this was
      known.&nbsp; The five members had gone for safety to a house in
      Coleman-street, in the City, where they were guarded all night; and indeed
      the whole city watched in arms like an army.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning, the King, already frightened at what he had done, came to the
      Guildhall, with only half a dozen lords, and made a speech to the people,
      hoping they would not shelter those whom he accused of treason.&nbsp; Next
      day, he issued a proclamation for the apprehension of the five members;
      but the Parliament minded it so little that they made great arrangements
      for having them brought down to Westminster in great state, five days
      afterwards.&nbsp; The King was so alarmed now at his own imprudence, if
      not for his own safety, that he left his palace at Whitehall, and went
      away with his Queen and children to Hampton Court.

      It was the eleventh of May, when the five members were carried in state
      and triumph to Westminster.&nbsp; They were taken by water.&nbsp; The
      river could not be seen for the boats on it; and the five members were
      hemmed in by barges full of men and great guns, ready to protect them, at
      any cost.&nbsp; Along the Strand a large body of the train-bands of
      London, under their commander, <span class="smcap">Skippon</span>, marched
      to be ready to assist the little fleet.&nbsp; Beyond them, came a crowd
      who choked the streets, roaring incessantly about the Bishops and the
      Papists, and crying out contemptuously as they passed Whitehall, &lsquo;What
      has become of the King?&rsquo;&nbsp; With this great noise outside the
      House of Commons, and with great silence within, Mr. Pym rose and informed
      the House of the great kindness with which they had been received in the
      City.&nbsp; Upon that, the House called the sheriffs in and thanked them,
      and requested the train-bands, under their commander Skippon, to guard the
      House of Commons every day.&nbsp; Then, came four thousand men on
      horseback out of Buckinghamshire, offering their services as a guard too,
      and bearing a petition to the King, complaining of the injury that had
      been done to Mr. Hampden, who was their county man and much beloved and
      honoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King set off for Hampton Court, the gentlemen and soldiers who
      had been with him followed him out of town as far as Kingston-upon-Thames;
      next day, Lord Digby came to them from the King at Hampton Court, in his
      coach and six, to inform them that the King accepted their protection.&nbsp;
      This, the Parliament said, was making war against the kingdom, and Lord
      Digby fled abroad.&nbsp; The Parliament then immediately applied
      themselves to getting hold of the military power of the country, well
      knowing that the King was already trying hard to use it against them, and
      that he had secretly sent the Earl of Newcastle to Hull, to secure a
      valuable magazine of arms and gunpowder that was there.&nbsp; In those
      times, every county had its own magazines of arms and powder, for its own
      train-bands or militia; so, the Parliament brought in a bill claiming the
      right (which up to this time had belonged to the King) of appointing the
      Lord Lieutenants of counties, who commanded these train-bands; also, of
      having all the forts, castles, and garrisons in the kingdom, put into the
      hands of such governors as they, the Parliament, could confide in.&nbsp;
      It also passed a law depriving the Bishops of their votes.&nbsp; The King
      gave his assent to that bill, but would not abandon the right of
      appointing the Lord Lieutenants, though he said he was willing to appoint
      such as might be suggested to him by the Parliament.&nbsp; When the Earl
      of Pembroke asked him whether he would not give way on that question for a
      time, he said, &lsquo;By God! not for one hour!&rsquo; and upon this he
      and the Parliament went to war.
    </p>
    <p>
      His young daughter was betrothed to the Prince of Orange.&nbsp; On
      pretence of taking her to the country of her future husband, the Queen was
      already got safely away to Holland, there to pawn the Crown jewels for
      money to raise an army on the King&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; The Lord Admiral
      being sick, the House of Commons now named the Earl of Warwick to hold his
      place for a year.&nbsp; The King named another gentleman; the House of
      Commons took its own way, and the Earl of Warwick became Lord Admiral
      without the King&rsquo;s consent.&nbsp; The Parliament sent orders down to
      Hull to have that magazine removed to London; the King went down to Hull
      to take it himself.&nbsp; The citizens would not admit him into the town,
      and the governor would not admit him into the castle.&nbsp; The Parliament
      resolved that whatever the two Houses passed, and the King would not
      consent to, should be called an <span class="smcap">Ordinance</span>, and
      should be as much a law as if he did consent to it.&nbsp; The King
      protested against this, and gave notice that these ordinances were not to
      be obeyed.&nbsp; The King, attended by the majority of the House of Peers,
      and by many members of the House of Commons, established himself at York.&nbsp;
      The Chancellor went to him with the Great Seal, and the Parliament made a
      new Great Seal.&nbsp; The Queen sent over a ship full of arms and
      ammunition, and the King issued letters to borrow money at high interest.&nbsp;
      The Parliament raised twenty regiments of foot and seventy-five troops of
      horse; and the people willingly aided them with their money, plate,
      jewellery, and trinkets&mdash;the married women even with their
      wedding-rings.&nbsp; Every member of Parliament who could raise a troop or
      a regiment in his own part of the country, dressed it according to his
      taste and in his own colours, and commanded it.&nbsp; Foremost among them
      all, <span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span> raised a troop of horse&mdash;thoroughly
      in earnest and thoroughly well armed&mdash;who were, perhaps, the best
      soldiers that ever were seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some of their proceedings, this famous Parliament passed the bounds of
      previous law and custom, yielded to and favoured riotous assemblages of
      the people, and acted tyrannically in imprisoning some who differed from
      the popular leaders.&nbsp; But again, you are always to remember that the
      twelve years during which the King had had his own wilful way, had gone
      before; and that nothing could make the times what they might, could,
      would, or should have been, if those twelve years had never rolled away.

    <h3>
      THIRD PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      I shall not try to relate the particulars of the great civil war between
      King Charles the First and the Long Parliament, which lasted nearly four
      years, and a full account of which would fill many large books.&nbsp; It
      was a sad thing that Englishmen should once more be fighting against
      Englishmen on English ground; but, it is some consolation to know that on
      both sides there was great humanity, forbearance, and honour.&nbsp; The
      soldiers of the Parliament were far more remarkable for these good
      qualities than the soldiers of the King (many of whom fought for mere pay
      without much caring for the cause); but those of the nobility and gentry
      who were on the King&rsquo;s side were so brave, and so faithful to him,
      that their conduct cannot but command our highest admiration.&nbsp; Among
      them were great numbers of Catholics, who took the royal side because the
      Queen was so strongly of their persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King might have distinguished some of these gallant spirits, if he had
      been as generous a spirit himself, by giving them the command of his army.&nbsp;
      Instead of that, however, true to his old high notions of royalty, he
      entrusted it to his two nephews, <span class="smcap">Prince Rupert</span>
      and <span class="smcap">Prince Maurice</span>, who were of royal blood and
      came over from abroad to help him.&nbsp; It might have been better for him
      if they had stayed away; since Prince Rupert was an impetuous, hot-headed
      fellow, whose only idea was to dash into battle at all times and seasons,
      and lay about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general-in-chief of the Parliamentary army was the Earl of Essex, a
      gentleman of honour and an excellent soldier.&nbsp; A little while before
      the war broke out, there had been some rioting at Westminster between
      certain officious law students and noisy soldiers, and the shopkeepers and
      their apprentices, and the general people in the streets.&nbsp; At that
      time the King&rsquo;s friends called the crowd, Roundheads, because the
      apprentices wore short hair; the crowd, in return, called their opponents
      Cavaliers, meaning that they were a blustering set, who pretended to be
      very military.&nbsp; These two words now began to be used to distinguish
      the two sides in the civil war.&nbsp; The Royalists also called the
      Parliamentary men Rebels and Rogues, while the Parliamentary men called <i>them</i>
      Malignants, and spoke of themselves as the Godly, the Honest, and so
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war broke out at Portsmouth, where that double traitor Goring had
      again gone over to the King and was besieged by the Parliamentary troops.&nbsp;
      Upon this, the King proclaimed the Earl of Essex and the officers serving
      under him, traitors, and called upon his loyal subjects to meet him in
      arms at Nottingham on the twenty-fifth of August.&nbsp; But his loyal
      subjects came about him in scanty numbers, and it was a windy, gloomy day,
      and the Royal Standard got blown down, and the whole affair was very
      melancholy.&nbsp; The chief engagements after this, took place in the vale
      of the Red Horse near Banbury, at Brentford, at Devizes, at Chalgrave
      Field (where Mr. Hampden was so sorely wounded while fighting at the head
      of his men, that he died within a week), at Newbury (in which battle <span
      class="smcap">Lord Falkland</span>, one of the best noblemen on the King&rsquo;s
      side, was killed), at Leicester, at Naseby, at Winchester, at Marston Moor
      near York, at Newcastle, and in many other parts of England and Scotland.&nbsp;
      These battles were attended with various successes.&nbsp; At one time, the
      King was victorious; at another time, the Parliament.&nbsp; But almost all
      the great and busy towns were against the King; and when it was considered
      necessary to fortify London, all ranks of people, from labouring men and
      women, up to lords and ladies, worked hard together with heartiness and
      good will.&nbsp; The most distinguished leaders on the Parliamentary side
      were <span class="smcap">Hampden</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas
      Fairfax</span>, and, above all, <span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>,
      and his son-in-law <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of this war, the people, to whom it was very expensive
      and irksome, and to whom it was made the more distressing by almost every
      family being divided&mdash;some of its members attaching themselves to one
      side and some to the other&mdash;were over and over again most anxious for
      peace.&nbsp; So were some of the best men in each cause.&nbsp;
      Accordingly, treaties of peace were discussed between commissioners from
      the Parliament and the King; at York, at Oxford (where the King held a
      little Parliament of his own), and at Uxbridge.&nbsp; But they came to
      nothing.&nbsp; In all these negotiations, and in all his difficulties, the
      King showed himself at his best.&nbsp; He was courageous, cool,
      self-possessed, and clever; but, the old taint of his character was always
      in him, and he was never for one single moment to be trusted.&nbsp; Lord
      Clarendon, the historian, one of his highest admirers, supposes that he
      had unhappily promised the Queen never to make peace without her consent,
      and that this must often be taken as his excuse.&nbsp; He never kept his
      word from night to morning.&nbsp; He signed a cessation of hostilities
      with the blood-stained Irish rebels for a sum of money, and invited the
      Irish regiments over, to help him against the Parliament.&nbsp; In the
      battle of Naseby, his cabinet was seized and was found to contain a
      correspondence with the Queen, in which he expressly told her that he had
      deceived the Parliament&mdash;a mongrel Parliament, he called it now, as
      an improvement on his old term of vipers&mdash;in pretending to recognise
      it and to treat with it; and from which it further appeared that he had
      long been in secret treaty with the Duke of Lorraine for a foreign army of
      ten thousand men.&nbsp; Disappointed in this, he sent a most devoted
      friend of his, the <span class="smcap">Earl of Glamorgan</span>, to
      Ireland, to conclude a secret treaty with the Catholic powers, to send him
      an Irish army of ten thousand men; in return for which he was to bestow
      great favours on the Catholic religion.&nbsp; And, when this treaty was
      discovered in the carriage of a fighting Irish Archbishop who was killed
      in one of the many skirmishes of those days, he basely denied and deserted
      his attached friend, the Earl, on his being charged with high treason; and&mdash;even
      worse than this&mdash;had left blanks in the secret instructions he gave
      him with his own kingly hand, expressly that he might thus save himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, on the twenty-seventh day of April, one thousand six hundred and
      forty-six, the King found himself in the city of Oxford, so surrounded by
      the Parliamentary army who were closing in upon him on all sides that he
      felt that if he would escape he must delay no longer.&nbsp; So, that
      night, having altered the cut of his hair and beard, he was dressed up as
      a servant and put upon a horse with a cloak strapped behind him, and rode
      out of the town behind one of his own faithful followers, with a clergyman
      of that country who knew the road well, for a guide.&nbsp; He rode towards
      London as far as Harrow, and then altered his plans and resolved, it would
      seem, to go to the Scottish camp.&nbsp; The Scottish men had been invited
      over to help the Parliamentary army, and had a large force then in
      England.&nbsp; The King was so desperately intriguing in everything he
      did, that it is doubtful what he exactly meant by this step.&nbsp; He took
      it, anyhow, and delivered himself up to the <span class="smcap">Earl of
      Leven</span>, the Scottish general-in-chief, who treated him as an
      honourable prisoner.&nbsp; Negotiations between the Parliament on the one
      hand and the Scottish authorities on the other, as to what should be done
      with him, lasted until the following February.&nbsp; Then, when the King
      had refused to the Parliament the concession of that old militia point for
      twenty years, and had refused to Scotland the recognition of its Solemn
      League and Covenant, Scotland got a handsome sum for its army and its
      help, and the King into the bargain.&nbsp; He was taken, by certain
      Parliamentary commissioners appointed to receive him, to one of his own
      houses, called Holmby House, near Althorpe, in Northamptonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Civil War was still in progress, John Pym died, and was buried
      with great honour in Westminster Abbey&mdash;not with greater honour than
      he deserved, for the liberties of Englishmen owe a mighty debt to Pym and
      Hampden.&nbsp; The war was but newly over when the Earl of Essex died, of
      an illness brought on by his having overheated himself in a stag hunt in
      Windsor Forest.&nbsp; He, too, was buried in Westminster Abbey, with great
      state.&nbsp; I wish it were not necessary to add that Archbishop Laud died
      upon the scaffold when the war was not yet done.&nbsp; His trial lasted in
      all nearly a year, and, it being doubtful even then whether the charges
      brought against him amounted to treason, the odious old contrivance of the
      worst kings was resorted to, and a bill of attainder was brought in
      against him.&nbsp; He was a violently prejudiced and mischievous person;
      had had strong ear-cropping and nose-splitting propensities, as you know;
      and had done a world of harm.&nbsp; But he died peaceably, and like a
      brave old man.
    </p>
    <h3>
      FOURTH PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the Parliament had got the King into their hands, they became very
      anxious to get rid of their army, in which Oliver Cromwell had begun to
      acquire great power; not only because of his courage and high abilities,
      but because he professed to be very sincere in the Scottish sort of
      Puritan religion that was then exceedingly popular among the soldiers.&nbsp;
      They were as much opposed to the Bishops as to the Pope himself; and the
      very privates, drummers, and trumpeters, had such an inconvenient habit of
      starting up and preaching long-winded discourses, that I would not have
      belonged to that army on any account.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the Parliament, being far from sure but that the army might begin to
      preach and fight against them now it had nothing else to do, proposed to
      disband the greater part of it, to send another part to serve in Ireland
      against the rebels, and to keep only a small force in England.&nbsp; But,
      the army would not consent to be broken up, except upon its own
      conditions; and, when the Parliament showed an intention of compelling it,
      it acted for itself in an unexpected manner.&nbsp; A certain cornet, of
      the name of <span class="smcap">Joice</span>, arrived at Holmby House one
      night, attended by four hundred horsemen, went into the King&rsquo;s room
      with his hat in one hand and a pistol in the other, and told the King that
      he had come to take him away.&nbsp; The King was willing enough to go, and
      only stipulated that he should be publicly required to do so next morning.&nbsp;
      Next morning, accordingly, he appeared on the top of the steps of the
      house, and asked Comet Joice before his men and the guard set there by the
      Parliament, what authority he had for taking him away?&nbsp; To this
      Cornet Joice replied, &lsquo;The authority of the army.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      &lsquo;Have you a written commission?&rsquo; said the King.&nbsp; Joice,
      pointing to his four hundred men on horseback, replied, &lsquo;That is my
      commission.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the King, smiling, as if
      he were pleased, &lsquo;I never before read such a commission; but it is
      written in fair and legible characters.&nbsp; This is a company of as
      handsome proper gentlemen as I have seen a long while.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was
      asked where he would like to live, and he said at Newmarket.&nbsp; So, to
      Newmarket he and Cornet Joice and the four hundred horsemen rode; the King
      remarking, in the same smiling way, that he could ride as far at a spell
      as Cornet Joice, or any man there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King quite believed, I think, that the army were his friends.&nbsp; He
      said as much to Fairfax when that general, Oliver Cromwell, and Ireton,
      went to persuade him to return to the custody of the Parliament.&nbsp; He
      preferred to remain as he was, and resolved to remain as he was.&nbsp; And
      when the army moved nearer and nearer London to frighten the Parliament
      into yielding to their demands, they took the King with them.&nbsp; It was
      a deplorable thing that England should be at the mercy of a great body of
      soldiers with arms in their hands; but the King certainly favoured them at
      this important time of his life, as compared with the more lawful power
      that tried to control him.&nbsp; It must be added, however, that they
      treated him, as yet, more respectfully and kindly than the Parliament had
      done.&nbsp; They allowed him to be attended by his own servants, to be
      splendidly entertained at various houses, and to see his children&mdash;at
      Cavesham House, near Reading&mdash;for two days.&nbsp; Whereas, the
      Parliament had been rather hard with him, and had only allowed him to ride
      out and play at bowls.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is much to be believed that if the King could have been trusted, even
      at this time, he might have been saved.&nbsp; Even Oliver Cromwell
      expressly said that he did believe that no man could enjoy his possessions
      in peace, unless the King had his rights.&nbsp; He was not unfriendly
      towards the King; he had been present when he received his children, and
      had been much affected by the pitiable nature of the scene; he saw the
      King often; he frequently walked and talked with him in the long galleries
      and pleasant gardens of the Palace at Hampton Court, whither he was now
      removed; and in all this risked something of his influence with the army.&nbsp;
      But, the King was in secret hopes of help from the Scottish people; and
      the moment he was encouraged to join them he began to be cool to his new
      friends, the army, and to tell the officers that they could not possibly
      do without him.&nbsp; At the very time, too, when he was promising to make
      Cromwell and Ireton noblemen, if they would help him up to his old height,
      he was writing to the Queen that he meant to hang them.&nbsp; They both
      afterwards declared that they had been privately informed that such a
      letter would be found, on a certain evening, sewed up in a saddle which
      would be taken to the Blue Boar in Holborn to be sent to Dover; and that
      they went there, disguised as common soldiers, and sat drinking in the
      inn-yard until a man came with the saddle, which they ripped up with their
      knives, and therein found the letter.&nbsp; I see little reason to doubt
      the story.&nbsp; It is certain that Oliver Cromwell told one of the King&rsquo;s
      most faithful followers that the King could not be trusted, and that he
      would not be answerable if anything amiss were to happen to him.&nbsp;
      Still, even after that, he kept a promise he had made to the King, by
      letting him know that there was a plot with a certain portion of the army
      to seize him.&nbsp; I believe that, in fact, he sincerely wanted the King
      to escape abroad, and so to be got rid of without more trouble or danger.&nbsp;
      That Oliver himself had work enough with the army is pretty plain; for
      some of the troops were so mutinous against him, and against those who
      acted with him at this time, that he found it necessary to have one man
      shot at the head of his regiment to overawe the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, when he received Oliver&rsquo;s warning, made his escape from
      Hampton Court; after some indecision and uncertainty, he went to
      Carisbrooke Castle in the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; At first, he was pretty
      free there; but, even there, he carried on a pretended treaty with the
      Parliament, while he was really treating with commissioners from Scotland
      to send an army into England to take his part.&nbsp; When he broke off
      this treaty with the Parliament (having settled with Scotland) and was
      treated as a prisoner, his treatment was not changed too soon, for he had
      plotted to escape that very night to a ship sent by the Queen, which was
      lying off the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was doomed to be disappointed in his hopes from Scotland.&nbsp; The
      agreement he had made with the Scottish Commissioners was not favourable
      enough to the religion of that country to please the Scottish clergy; and
      they preached against it.&nbsp; The consequence was, that the army raised
      in Scotland and sent over, was too small to do much; and that, although it
      was helped by a rising of the Royalists in England and by good soldiers
      from Ireland, it could make no head against the Parliamentary army under
      such men as Cromwell and Fairfax.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s eldest son, the
      Prince of Wales, came over from Holland with nineteen ships (a part of the
      English fleet having gone over to him) to help his father; but nothing
      came of his voyage, and he was fain to return.&nbsp; The most remarkable
      event of this second civil war was the cruel execution by the
      Parliamentary General, of <span class="smcap">Sir Charles Lucas</span> and
      <span class="smcap">Sir George Lisle</span>, two grand Royalist generals,
      who had bravely defended Colchester under every disadvantage of famine and
      distress for nearly three months.&nbsp; When Sir Charles Lucas was shot,
      Sir George Lisle kissed his body, and said to the soldiers who were to
      shoot him, &lsquo;Come nearer, and make sure of me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
      warrant you, Sir George,&rsquo; said one of the soldiers, &lsquo;we shall
      hit you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Ay</span>?&rsquo; he
      returned with a smile, &lsquo;but I have been nearer to you, my friends,
      many a time, and you have missed me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliament, after being fearfully bullied by the army&mdash;who
      demanded to have seven members whom they disliked given up to them&mdash;had
      voted that they would have nothing more to do with the King.&nbsp; On the
      conclusion, however, of this second civil war (which did not last more
      than six months), they appointed commissioners to treat with him.&nbsp;
      The King, then so far released again as to be allowed to live in a private
      house at Newport in the Isle of Wight, managed his own part of the
      negotiation with a sense that was admired by all who saw him, and gave up,
      in the end, all that was asked of him&mdash;even yielding (which he had
      steadily refused, so far) to the temporary abolition of the bishops, and
      the transfer of their church land to the Crown.&nbsp; Still, with his old
      fatal vice upon him, when his best friends joined the commissioners in
      beseeching him to yield all those points as the only means of saving
      himself from the army, he was plotting to escape from the island; he was
      holding correspondence with his friends and the Catholics in Ireland,
      though declaring that he was not; and he was writing, with his own hand,
      that in what he yielded he meant nothing but to get time to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters were at this pass when the army, resolved to defy the Parliament,
      marched up to London.&nbsp; The Parliament, not afraid of them now, and
      boldly led by Hollis, voted that the King&rsquo;s concessions were
      sufficient ground for settling the peace of the kingdom.&nbsp; Upon that,
      <span class="smcap">Colonel Rich</span> and <span class="smcap">Colonel
      Pride</span> went down to the House of Commons with a regiment of horse
      soldiers and a regiment of foot; and Colonel Pride, standing in the lobby
      with a list of the members who were obnoxious to the army in his hand, had
      them pointed out to him as they came through, and took them all into
      custody.&nbsp; This proceeding was afterwards called by the people, for a
      joke, <span class="smcap">Pride&rsquo;s Purge</span>.&nbsp; Cromwell was
      in the North, at the head of his men, at the time, but when he came home,
      approved of what had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      What with imprisoning some members and causing others to stay away, the
      army had now reduced the House of Commons to some fifty or so.&nbsp; These
      soon voted that it was treason in a king to make war against his
      parliament and his people, and sent an ordinance up to the House of Lords
      for the King&rsquo;s being tried as a traitor.&nbsp; The House of Lords,
      then sixteen in number, to a man rejected it.&nbsp; Thereupon, the Commons
      made an ordinance of their own, that they were the supreme government of
      the country, and would bring the King to trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King had been taken for security to a place called Hurst Castle: a
      lonely house on a rock in the sea, connected with the coast of Hampshire
      by a rough road two miles long at low water.&nbsp; Thence, he was ordered
      to be removed to Windsor; thence, after being but rudely used there, and
      having none but soldiers to wait upon him at table, he was brought up to
      St. James&rsquo;s Palace in London, and told that his trial was appointed
      for next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday, the twentieth of January, one thousand six hundred and
      forty-nine, this memorable trial began.&nbsp; The House of Commons had
      settled that one hundred and thirty-five persons should form the Court,
      and these were taken from the House itself, from among the officers of the
      army, and from among the lawyers and citizens.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John
      Bradshaw</span>, serjeant-at-law, was appointed president.&nbsp; The place
      was Westminster Hall.&nbsp; At the upper end, in a red velvet chair, sat
      the president, with his hat (lined with plates of iron for his protection)
      on his head.&nbsp; The rest of the Court sat on side benches, also wearing
      their hats.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s seat was covered with velvet, like that
      of the president, and was opposite to it.&nbsp; He was brought from St.
      James&rsquo;s to Whitehall, and from Whitehall he came by water to his
      trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came in, he looked round very steadily on the Court, and on the
      great number of spectators, and then sat down: presently he got up and
      looked round again.&nbsp; On the indictment &lsquo;against Charles Stuart,
      for high treason,&rsquo; being read, he smiled several times, and he
      denied the authority of the Court, saying that there could be no
      parliament without a House of Lords, and that he saw no House of Lords
      there.&nbsp; Also, that the King ought to be there, and that he saw no
      King in the King&rsquo;s right place.&nbsp; Bradshaw replied, that the
      Court was satisfied with its authority, and that its authority was God&rsquo;s
      authority and the kingdom&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He then adjourned the Court to
      the following Monday.&nbsp; On that day, the trial was resumed, and went
      on all the week.&nbsp; When the Saturday came, as the King passed forward
      to his place in the Hall, some soldiers and others cried for &lsquo;justice!&rsquo;
      and execution on him.&nbsp; That day, too, Bradshaw, like an angry Sultan,
      wore a red robe, instead of the black robe he had worn before.&nbsp; The
      King was sentenced to death that day.&nbsp; As he went out, one solitary
      soldier said, &lsquo;God bless you, Sir!&rsquo;&nbsp; For this, his
      officer struck him.&nbsp; The King said he thought the punishment exceeded
      the offence.&nbsp; The silver head of his walking-stick had fallen off
      while he leaned upon it, at one time of the trial.&nbsp; The accident
      seemed to disturb him, as if he thought it ominous of the falling of his
      own head; and he admitted as much, now it was all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being taken back to Whitehall, he sent to the House of Commons, saying
      that as the time of his execution might be nigh, he wished he might be
      allowed to see his darling children.&nbsp; It was granted.&nbsp; On the
      Monday he was taken back to St. James&rsquo;s; and his two children then
      in England, the <span class="smcap">Princess Elizabeth</span> thirteen
      years old, and the <span class="smcap">Duke Of Gloucester</span> nine
      years old, were brought to take leave of him, from Sion House, near
      Brentford.&nbsp; It was a sad and touching scene, when he kissed and
      fondled those poor children, and made a little present of two diamond
      seals to the Princess, and gave them tender messages to their mother (who
      little deserved them, for she had a lover of her own whom she married soon
      afterwards), and told them that he died &lsquo;for the laws and liberties
      of the land.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am bound to say that I don&rsquo;t think he
      did, but I dare say he believed so.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were ambassadors from Holland that day, to intercede for the unhappy
      King, whom you and I both wish the Parliament had spared; but they got no
      answer.&nbsp; The Scottish Commissioners interceded too; so did the Prince
      of Wales, by a letter in which he offered as the next heir to the throne,
      to accept any conditions from the Parliament; so did the Queen, by letter
      likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all, the warrant for the execution was this day signed.&nbsp;
      There is a story that as Oliver Cromwell went to the table with the pen in
      his hand to put his signature to it, he drew his pen across the face of
      one of the commissioners, who was standing near, and marked it with ink.&nbsp;
      That commissioner had not signed his own name yet, and the story adds that
      when he came to do it he marked Cromwell&rsquo;s face with ink in the same
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King slept well, untroubled by the knowledge that it was his last
      night on earth, and rose on the thirtieth of January, two hours before
      day, and dressed himself carefully.&nbsp; He put on two shirts lest he
      should tremble with the cold, and had his hair very carefully combed.&nbsp;
      The warrant had been directed to three officers of the army, <span
      class="smcap">Colonel Hacker</span>, <span class="smcap">Colonel Hunks</span>,
      and <span class="smcap">Colonel Phayer</span>.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock,
      the first of these came to the door and said it was time to go to
      Whitehall.&nbsp; The King, who had always been a quick walker, walked at
      his usual speed through the Park, and called out to the guard, with his
      accustomed voice of command, &lsquo;March on apace!&rsquo;&nbsp; When he
      came to Whitehall, he was taken to his own bedroom, where a breakfast was
      set forth.&nbsp; As he had taken the Sacrament, he would eat nothing more;
      but, at about the time when the church bells struck twelve at noon (for he
      had to wait, through the scaffold not being ready), he took the advice of
      the good <span class="smcap">Bishop Juxon</span> who was with him, and ate
      a little bread and drank a glass of claret.&nbsp; Soon after he had taken
      this refreshment, Colonel Hacker came to the chamber with the warrant in
      his hand, and called for Charles Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, through the long gallery of Whitehall Palace, which he had often
      seen light and gay and merry and crowded, in very different times, the
      fallen King passed along, until he came to the centre window of the
      Banqueting House, through which he emerged upon the scaffold, which was
      hung with black.&nbsp; He looked at the two executioners, who were dressed
      in black and masked; he looked at the troops of soldiers on horseback and
      on foot, and all looked up at him in silence; he looked at the vast array
      of spectators, filling up the view beyond, and turning all their faces
      upon him; he looked at his old Palace of St. James&rsquo;s; and he looked
      at the block.&nbsp; He seemed a little troubled to find that it was so
      low, and asked, &lsquo;if there were no place higher?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then,
      to those upon the scaffold, he said, &lsquo;that it was the Parliament who
      had begun the war, and not he; but he hoped they might be guiltless too,
      as ill instruments had gone between them.&nbsp; In one respect,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;he suffered justly; and that was because he had permitted an
      unjust sentence to be executed on another.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this he
      referred to the Earl of Strafford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not at all afraid to die; but he was anxious to die easily.&nbsp;
      When some one touched the axe while he was speaking, he broke off and
      called out, &lsquo;Take heed of the axe! take heed of the axe!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      He also said to Colonel Hacker, &lsquo;Take care that they do not put me
      to pain.&rsquo;&nbsp; He told the executioner, &lsquo;I shall say but very
      short prayers, and then thrust out my hands&rsquo;&mdash;as the sign to
      strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hair up, under a white satin cap which the bishop had carried,
      and said, &lsquo;I have a good cause and a gracious God on my side.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      The bishop told him that he had but one stage more to travel in this weary
      world, and that, though it was a turbulent and troublesome stage, it was a
      short one, and would carry him a great way&mdash;all the way from earth to
      Heaven.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s last word, as he gave his cloak and the
      George&mdash;the decoration from his breast&mdash;to the bishop, was,
      &lsquo;Remember!&rsquo;&nbsp; He then kneeled down, laid his head on the
      block, spread out his hands, and was instantly killed.&nbsp; One universal
      groan broke from the crowd; and the soldiers, who had sat on their horses
      and stood in their ranks immovable as statues, were of a sudden all in
      motion, clearing the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in the forty-ninth year of his age, falling at the same time of his
      career as Strafford had fallen in his, perished Charles the First.&nbsp;
      With all my sorrow for him, I cannot agree with him that he died &lsquo;the
      martyr of the people;&rsquo; for the people had been martyrs to him, and
      to his ideas of a King&rsquo;s rights, long before.&nbsp; Indeed, I am
      afraid that he was but a bad judge of martyrs; for he had called that
      infamous Duke of Buckingham &lsquo;the Martyr of his Sovereign.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER OLIVER CROMWELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before sunset on the memorable day on which King Charles the First was
      executed, the House of Commons passed an act declaring it treason in any
      one to proclaim the Prince of Wales&mdash;or anybody else&mdash;King of
      England.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, it declared that the House of Lords was
      useless and dangerous, and ought to be abolished; and directed that the
      late King&rsquo;s statue should be taken down from the Royal Exchange in
      the City and other public places.&nbsp; Having laid hold of some famous
      Royalists who had escaped from prison, and having beheaded the <span
      class="smcap">Duke Of Hamilton</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord Holland</span>,
      and <span class="smcap">Lord Capel</span>, in Palace Yard (all of whom
      died very courageously), they then appointed a Council of State to govern
      the country.&nbsp; It consisted of forty-one members, of whom five were
      peers.&nbsp; Bradshaw was made president.&nbsp; The House of Commons also
      re-admitted members who had opposed the King&rsquo;s death, and made up
      its numbers to about a hundred and fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it still had an army of more than forty thousand men to deal with,
      and a very hard task it was to manage them.&nbsp; Before the King&rsquo;s
      execution, the army had appointed some of its officers to remonstrate
      between them and the Parliament; and now the common soldiers began to take
      that office upon themselves.&nbsp; The regiments under orders for Ireland
      mutinied; one troop of horse in the city of London seized their own flag,
      and refused to obey orders.&nbsp; For this, the ringleader was shot: which
      did not mend the matter, for, both his comrades and the people made a
      public funeral for him, and accompanied the body to the grave with sound
      of trumpets and with a gloomy procession of persons carrying bundles of
      rosemary steeped in blood.&nbsp; Oliver was the only man to deal with such
      difficulties as these, and he soon cut them short by bursting at midnight
      into the town of Burford, near Salisbury, where the mutineers were
      sheltered, taking four hundred of them prisoners, and shooting a number of
      them by sentence of court-martial.&nbsp; The soldiers soon found, as all
      men did, that Oliver was not a man to be trifled with.&nbsp; And there was
      an end of the mutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scottish Parliament did not know Oliver yet; so, on hearing of the
      King&rsquo;s execution, it proclaimed the Prince of Wales King Charles the
      Second, on condition of his respecting the Solemn League and Covenant.&nbsp;
      Charles was abroad at that time, and so was Montrose, from whose help he
      had hopes enough to keep him holding on and off with commissioners from
      Scotland, just as his father might have done.&nbsp; These hopes were soon
      at an end; for, Montrose, having raised a few hundred exiles in Germany,
      and landed with them in Scotland, found that the people there, instead of
      joining him, deserted the country at his approach.&nbsp; He was soon taken
      prisoner and carried to Edinburgh.&nbsp; There he was received with every
      possible insult, and carried to prison in a cart, his officers going two
      and two before him.&nbsp; He was sentenced by the Parliament to be hanged
      on a gallows thirty feet high, to have his head set on a spike in
      Edinburgh, and his limbs distributed in other places, according to the old
      barbarous manner.&nbsp; He said he had always acted under the Royal
      orders, and only wished he had limbs enough to be distributed through
      Christendom, that it might be the more widely known how loyal he had been.&nbsp;
      He went to the scaffold in a bright and brilliant dress, and made a bold
      end at thirty-eight years of age.&nbsp; The breath was scarcely out of his
      body when Charles abandoned his memory, and denied that he had ever given
      him orders to rise in his behalf.&nbsp; O the family failing was strong in
      that Charles then!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver had been appointed by the Parliament to command the army in
      Ireland, where he took a terrible vengeance for the sanguinary rebellion,
      and made tremendous havoc, particularly in the siege of Drogheda, where no
      quarter was given, and where he found at least a thousand of the
      inhabitants shut up together in the great church: every one of whom was
      killed by his soldiers, usually known as <span class="smcap">Oliver&rsquo;s
      Ironsides</span>.&nbsp; There were numbers of friars and priests among
      them, and Oliver gruffly wrote home in his despatch that these were
      &lsquo;knocked on the head&rsquo; like the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Charles having got over to Scotland where the men of the Solemn
      League and Covenant led him a prodigiously dull life and made him very
      weary with long sermons and grim Sundays, the Parliament called the
      redoubtable Oliver home to knock the Scottish men on the head for setting
      up that Prince.&nbsp; Oliver left his son-in-law, Ireton, as general in
      Ireland in his stead (he died there afterwards), and he imitated the
      example of his father-in-law with such good will that he brought the
      country to subjection, and laid it at the feet of the Parliament.&nbsp; In
      the end, they passed an act for the settlement of Ireland, generally
      pardoning all the common people, but exempting from this grace such of the
      wealthier sort as had been concerned in the rebellion, or in any killing
      of Protestants, or who refused to lay down their arms.&nbsp; Great numbers
      of Irish were got out of the country to serve under Catholic powers
      abroad, and a quantity of land was declared to have been forfeited by past
      offences, and was given to people who had lent money to the Parliament
      early in the war.&nbsp; These were sweeping measures; but, if Oliver
      Cromwell had had his own way fully, and had stayed in Ireland, he would
      have done more yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as I have said, the Parliament wanted Oliver for Scotland; so,
      home Oliver came, and was made Commander of all the Forces of the
      Commonwealth of England, and in three days away he went with sixteen
      thousand soldiers to fight the Scottish men.&nbsp; Now, the Scottish men,
      being then&mdash;as you will generally find them now&mdash;mighty
      cautious, reflected that the troops they had were not used to war like the
      Ironsides, and would be beaten in an open fight.&nbsp; Therefore they
      said, &lsquo;If we live quiet in our trenches in Edinburgh here, and if
      all the farmers come into the town and desert the country, the Ironsides
      will be driven out by iron hunger and be forced to go away.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      This was, no doubt, the wisest plan; but as the Scottish clergy <i>would</i>
      interfere with what they knew nothing about, and would perpetually preach
      long sermons exhorting the soldiers to come out and fight, the soldiers
      got it in their heads that they absolutely must come out and fight.&nbsp;
      Accordingly, in an evil hour for themselves, they came out of their safe
      position.&nbsp; Oliver fell upon them instantly, and killed three
      thousand, and took ten thousand prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      To gratify the Scottish Parliament, and preserve their favour, Charles had
      signed a declaration they laid before him, reproaching the memory of his
      father and mother, and representing himself as a most religious Prince, to
      whom the Solemn League and Covenant was as dear as life.&nbsp; He meant no
      sort of truth in this, and soon afterwards galloped away on horseback to
      join some tiresome Highland friends, who were always flourishing dirks and
      broadswords.&nbsp; He was overtaken and induced to return; but this
      attempt, which was called &lsquo;The Start,&rsquo; did him just so much
      service, that they did not preach quite such long sermons at him
      afterwards as they had done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first of January, one thousand six hundred and fifty-one, the
      Scottish people crowned him at Scone.&nbsp; He immediately took the chief
      command of an army of twenty thousand men, and marched to Stirling.&nbsp;
      His hopes were heightened, I dare say, by the redoubtable Oliver being ill
      of an ague; but Oliver scrambled out of bed in no time, and went to work
      with such energy that he got behind the Royalist army and cut it off from
      all communication with Scotland.&nbsp; There was nothing for it then, but
      to go on to England; so it went on as far as Worcester, where the mayor
      and some of the gentry proclaimed King Charles the Second straightway.&nbsp;
      His proclamation, however, was of little use to him, for very few
      Royalists appeared; and, on the very same day, two people were publicly
      beheaded on Tower Hill for espousing his cause.&nbsp; Up came Oliver to
      Worcester too, at double quick speed, and he and his Ironsides so laid
      about them in the great battle which was fought there, that they
      completely beat the Scottish men, and destroyed the Royalist army; though
      the Scottish men fought so gallantly that it took five hours to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The escape of Charles after this battle of Worcester did him good service
      long afterwards, for it induced many of the generous English people to
      take a romantic interest in him, and to think much better of him than he
      ever deserved.&nbsp; He fled in the night, with not more than sixty
      followers, to the house of a Catholic lady in Staffordshire.&nbsp; There,
      for his greater safety, the whole sixty left him.&nbsp; He cropped his
      hair, stained his face and hands brown as if they were sunburnt, put on
      the clothes of a labouring countryman, and went out in the morning with
      his axe in his hand, accompanied by four wood-cutters who were brothers,
      and another man who was their brother-in-law.&nbsp; These good fellows
      made a bed for him under a tree, as the weather was very bad; and the wife
      of one of them brought him food to eat; and the old mother of the four
      brothers came and fell down on her knees before him in the wood, and
      thanked God that her sons were engaged in saving his life.&nbsp; At night,
      he came out of the forest and went on to another house which was near the
      river Severn, with the intention of passing into Wales; but the place
      swarmed with soldiers, and the bridges were guarded, and all the boats
      were made fast.&nbsp; So, after lying in a hayloft covered over with hay,
      for some time, he came out of his place, attended by <span class="smcap">Colonel
      Careless</span>, a Catholic gentleman who had met him there, and with whom
      he lay hid, all next day, up in the shady branches of a fine old oak.&nbsp;
      It was lucky for the King that it was September-time, and that the leaves
      had not begun to fall, since he and the Colonel, perched up in this tree,
      could catch glimpses of the soldiers riding about below, and could hear
      the crash in the wood as they went about beating the boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, he walked and walked until his feet were all blistered; and,
      having been concealed all one day in a house which was searched by the
      troopers while he was there, went with <span class="smcap">Lord Wilmot</span>,
      another of his good friends, to a place called Bentley, where one <span
      class="smcap">Miss Lane</span>, a Protestant lady, had obtained a pass to
      be allowed to ride through the guards to see a relation of hers near
      Bristol.&nbsp; Disguised as a servant, he rode in the saddle before this
      young lady to the house of <span class="smcap">Sir John Winter</span>,
      while Lord Wilmot rode there boldly, like a plain country gentleman, with
      dogs at his heels.&nbsp; It happened that Sir John Winter&rsquo;s butler
      had been servant in Richmond Palace, and knew Charles the moment he set
      eyes upon him; but, the butler was faithful and kept the secret.&nbsp; As
      no ship could be found to carry him abroad, it was planned that he should
      go&mdash;still travelling with Miss Lane as her servant&mdash;to another
      house, at Trent near Sherborne in Dorsetshire; and then Miss Lane and her
      cousin, <span class="smcap">Mr. Lascelles</span>, who had gone on
      horseback beside her all the way, went home.&nbsp; I hope Miss Lane was
      going to marry that cousin, for I am sure she must have been a brave, kind
      girl.&nbsp; If I had been that cousin, I should certainly have loved Miss
      Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charles, lonely for the loss of Miss Lane, was safe at Trent, a ship
      was hired at Lyme, the master of which engaged to take two gentlemen to
      France.&nbsp; In the evening of the same day, the King&mdash;now riding as
      servant before another young lady&mdash;set off for a public-house at a
      place called Charmouth, where the captain of the vessel was to take him on
      board.&nbsp; But, the captain&rsquo;s wife, being afraid of her husband
      getting into trouble, locked him up and would not let him sail.&nbsp; Then
      they went away to Bridport; and, coming to the inn there, found the
      stable-yard full of soldiers who were on the look-out for Charles, and who
      talked about him while they drank.&nbsp; He had such presence of mind,
      that he led the horses of his party through the yard as any other servant
      might have done, and said, &lsquo;Come out of the way, you soldiers; let
      us have room to pass here!&rsquo;&nbsp; As he went along, he met a
      half-tipsy ostler, who rubbed his eyes and said to him, &lsquo;Why, I was
      formerly servant to Mr. Potter at Exeter, and surely I have sometimes seen
      you there, young man?&rsquo;&nbsp; He certainly had, for Charles had
      lodged there.&nbsp; His ready answer was, &lsquo;Ah, I did live with him
      once; but I have no time to talk now.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have a pot of beer
      together when I come back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From this dangerous place he returned to Trent, and lay there concealed
      several days.&nbsp; Then he escaped to Heale, near Salisbury; where, in
      the house of a widow lady, he was hidden five days, until the master of a
      collier lying off Shoreham in Sussex, undertook to convey a &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo;
      to France.&nbsp; On the night of the fifteenth of October, accompanied by
      two colonels and a merchant, the King rode to Brighton, then a little
      fishing village, to give the captain of the ship a supper before going on
      board; but, so many people knew him, that this captain knew him too, and
      not only he, but the landlord and landlady also.&nbsp; Before he went
      away, the landlord came behind his chair, kissed his hand, and said he
      hoped to live to be a lord and to see his wife a lady; at which Charles
      laughed.&nbsp; They had had a good supper by this time, and plenty of
      smoking and drinking, at which the King was a first-rate hand; so, the
      captain assured him that he would stand by him, and he did.&nbsp; It was
      agreed that the captain should pretend to sail to Deal, and that Charles
      should address the sailors and say he was a gentleman in debt who was
      running away from his creditors, and that he hoped they would join him in
      persuading the captain to put him ashore in France.&nbsp; As the King
      acted his part very well indeed, and gave the sailors twenty shillings to
      drink, they begged the captain to do what such a worthy gentleman asked.&nbsp;
      He pretended to yield to their entreaties, and the King got safe to
      Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ireland being now subdued, and Scotland kept quiet by plenty of forts and
      soldiers put there by Oliver, the Parliament would have gone on quietly
      enough, as far as fighting with any foreign enemy went, but for getting
      into trouble with the Dutch, who in the spring of the year one thousand
      six hundred and fifty-one sent a fleet into the Downs under their <span
      class="smcap">Admiral Van Tromp</span>, to call upon the bold English
      <span class="smcap">Admiral Blake</span> (who was there with half as many
      ships as the Dutch) to strike his flag.&nbsp; Blake fired a raging
      broadside instead, and beat off Van Tromp; who, in the autumn, came back
      again with seventy ships, and challenged the bold Blake&mdash;who still
      was only half as strong&mdash;to fight him.&nbsp; Blake fought him all
      day; but, finding that the Dutch were too many for him, got quietly off at
      night.&nbsp; What does Van Tromp upon this, but goes cruising and boasting
      about the Channel, between the North Foreland and the Isle of Wight, with
      a great Dutch broom tied to his masthead, as a sign that he could and
      would sweep the English of the sea!&nbsp; Within three months, Blake
      lowered his tone though, and his broom too; for, he and two other bold
      commanders, <span class="smcap">Dean</span> and <span class="smcap">Monk</span>,
      fought him three whole days, took twenty-three of his ships, shivered his
      broom to pieces, and settled his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were no sooner quiet again, than the army began to complain to the
      Parliament that they were not governing the nation properly, and to hint
      that they thought they could do it better themselves.&nbsp; Oliver, who
      had now made up his mind to be the head of the state, or nothing at all,
      supported them in this, and called a meeting of officers and his own
      Parliamentary friends, at his lodgings in Whitehall, to consider the best
      way of getting rid of the Parliament.&nbsp; It had now lasted just as many
      years as the King&rsquo;s unbridled power had lasted, before it came into
      existence.&nbsp; The end of the deliberation was, that Oliver went down to
      the House in his usual plain black dress, with his usual grey worsted
      stockings, but with an unusual party of soldiers behind him.&nbsp; These
      last he left in the lobby, and then went in and sat down.&nbsp; Presently
      he got up, made the Parliament a speech, told them that the Lord had done
      with them, stamped his foot and said, &lsquo;You are no Parliament.&nbsp;
      Bring them in!&nbsp; Bring them in!&rsquo;&nbsp; At this signal the door
      flew open, and the soldiers appeared.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is not honest,&rsquo;
      said Sir Harry Vane, one of the members.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir Harry Vane!&rsquo;
      cried Cromwell; &lsquo;O, Sir Harry Vane!&nbsp; The Lord deliver me from
      Sir Harry Vane!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he pointed out members one by one, and
      said this man was a drunkard, and that man a dissipated fellow, and that
      man a liar, and so on.&nbsp; Then he caused the Speaker to be walked out
      of his chair, told the guard to clear the House, called the mace upon the
      table&mdash;which is a sign that the House is sitting&mdash;&lsquo;a fool&rsquo;s
      bauble,&rsquo; and said, &lsquo;here, carry it away!&rsquo;&nbsp; Being
      obeyed in all these orders, he quietly locked the door, put the key in his
      pocket, walked back to Whitehall again, and told his friends, who were
      still assembled there, what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      They formed a new Council of State after this extraordinary proceeding,
      and got a new Parliament together in their own way: which Oliver himself
      opened in a sort of sermon, and which he said was the beginning of a
      perfect heaven upon earth.&nbsp; In this Parliament there sat a well-known
      leather-seller, who had taken the singular name of Praise God Barebones,
      and from whom it was called, for a joke, Barebones&rsquo;s Parliament,
      though its general name was the Little Parliament.&nbsp; As it soon
      appeared that it was not going to put Oliver in the first place, it turned
      out to be not at all like the beginning of heaven upon earth, and Oliver
      said it really was not to be borne with.&nbsp; So he cleared off that
      Parliament in much the same way as he had disposed of the other; and then
      the council of officers decided that he must be made the supreme authority
      of the kingdom, under the title of the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on the sixteenth of December, one thousand six hundred and
      fifty-three, a great procession was formed at Oliver&rsquo;s door, and he
      came out in a black velvet suit and a big pair of boots, and got into his
      coach and went down to Westminster, attended by the judges, and the lord
      mayor, and the aldermen, and all the other great and wonderful personages
      of the country.&nbsp; There, in the Court of Chancery, he publicly
      accepted the office of Lord Protector.&nbsp; Then he was sworn, and the
      City sword was handed to him, and the seal was handed to him, and all the
      other things were handed to him which are usually handed to Kings and
      Queens on state occasions.&nbsp; When Oliver had handed them all back, he
      was quite made and completely finished off as Lord Protector; and several
      of the Ironsides preached about it at great length, all the evening.
    </p>
    <h3>
      SECOND PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      Oliver Cromwell&mdash;whom the people long called <span class="smcap">Old
      Noll</span>&mdash;in accepting the office of Protector, had bound himself
      by a certain paper which was handed to him, called &lsquo;the Instrument,&rsquo;
      to summon a Parliament, consisting of between four and five hundred
      members, in the election of which neither the Royalists nor the Catholics
      were to have any share.&nbsp; He had also pledged himself that this
      Parliament should not be dissolved without its own consent until it had
      sat five months.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this Parliament met, Oliver made a speech to them of three hours
      long, very wisely advising them what to do for the credit and happiness of
      the country.&nbsp; To keep down the more violent members, he required them
      to sign a recognition of what they were forbidden by &lsquo;the Instrument&rsquo;
      to do; which was, chiefly, to take the power from one single person at the
      head of the state or to command the army.&nbsp; Then he dismissed them to
      go to work.&nbsp; With his usual vigour and resolution he went to work
      himself with some frantic preachers&mdash;who were rather overdoing their
      sermons in calling him a villain and a tyrant&mdash;by shutting up their
      chapels, and sending a few of them off to prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not at that time, in England or anywhere else, a man so able to
      govern the country as Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; Although he ruled with a
      strong hand, and levied a very heavy tax on the Royalists (but not until
      they had plotted against his life), he ruled wisely, and as the times
      required.&nbsp; He caused England to be so respected abroad, that I wish
      some lords and gentlemen who have governed it under kings and queens in
      later days would have taken a leaf out of Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s book.&nbsp;
      He sent bold Admiral Blake to the Mediterranean Sea, to make the Duke of
      Tuscany pay sixty thousand pounds for injuries he had done to British
      subjects, and spoliation he had committed on English merchants.&nbsp; He
      further despatched him and his fleet to Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, to
      have every English ship and every English man delivered up to him that had
      been taken by pirates in those parts.&nbsp; All this was gloriously done;
      and it began to be thoroughly well known, all over the world, that England
      was governed by a man in earnest, who would not allow the English name to
      be insulted or slighted anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were not all his foreign triumphs.&nbsp; He sent a fleet to sea
      against the Dutch; and the two powers, each with one hundred ships upon
      its side, met in the English Channel off the North Foreland, where the
      fight lasted all day long.&nbsp; Dean was killed in this fight; but Monk,
      who commanded in the same ship with him, threw his cloak over his body,
      that the sailors might not know of his death, and be disheartened.&nbsp;
      Nor were they.&nbsp; The English broadsides so exceedingly astonished the
      Dutch that they sheered off at last, though the redoubtable Van Tromp
      fired upon them with his own guns for deserting their flag.&nbsp; Soon
      afterwards, the two fleets engaged again, off the coast of Holland.&nbsp;
      There, the valiant Van Tromp was shot through the heart, and the Dutch
      gave in, and peace was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further than this, Oliver resolved not to bear the domineering and bigoted
      conduct of Spain, which country not only claimed a right to all the gold
      and silver that could be found in South America, and treated the ships of
      all other countries who visited those regions, as pirates, but put English
      subjects into the horrible Spanish prisons of the Inquisition.&nbsp; So,
      Oliver told the Spanish ambassador that English ships must be free to go
      wherever they would, and that English merchants must not be thrown into
      those same dungeons, no, not for the pleasure of all the priests in Spain.&nbsp;
      To this, the Spanish ambassador replied that the gold and silver country,
      and the Holy Inquisition, were his King&rsquo;s two eyes, neither of which
      he could submit to have put out.&nbsp; Very well, said Oliver, then he was
      afraid he (Oliver) must damage those two eyes directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, another fleet was despatched under two commanders, <span class="smcap">Penn</span>
      and <span class="smcap">Venables</span>, for Hispaniola; where, however,
      the Spaniards got the better of the fight.&nbsp; Consequently, the fleet
      came home again, after taking Jamaica on the way.&nbsp; Oliver, indignant
      with the two commanders who had not done what bold Admiral Blake would
      have done, clapped them both into prison, declared war against Spain, and
      made a treaty with France, in virtue of which it was to shelter the King
      and his brother the Duke of York no longer.&nbsp; Then, he sent a fleet
      abroad under bold Admiral Blake, which brought the King of Portugal to his
      senses&mdash;just to keep its hand in&mdash;and then engaged a Spanish
      fleet, sunk four great ships, and took two more, laden with silver to the
      value of two millions of pounds: which dazzling prize was brought from
      Portsmouth to London in waggons, with the populace of all the towns and
      villages through which the waggons passed, shouting with all their might.&nbsp;
      After this victory, bold Admiral Blake sailed away to the port of Santa
      Cruz to cut off the Spanish treasure-ships coming from Mexico.&nbsp;
      There, he found them, ten in number, with seven others to take care of
      them, and a big castle, and seven batteries, all roaring and blazing away
      at him with great guns.&nbsp; Blake cared no more for great guns than for
      pop-guns&mdash;no more for their hot iron balls than for snow-balls.&nbsp;
      He dashed into the harbour, captured and burnt every one of the ships, and
      came sailing out again triumphantly, with the victorious English flag
      flying at his masthead.&nbsp; This was the last triumph of this great
      commander, who had sailed and fought until he was quite worn out.&nbsp; He
      died, as his successful ship was coming into Plymouth Harbour amidst the
      joyful acclamations of the people, and was buried in state in Westminster
      Abbey.&nbsp; Not to lie there, long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and above all this, Oliver found that the <span class="smcap">Vaudois</span>,
      or Protestant people of the valleys of Lucerne, were insolently treated by
      the Catholic powers, and were even put to death for their religion, in an
      audacious and bloody manner.&nbsp; Instantly, he informed those powers
      that this was a thing which Protestant England would not allow; and he
      speedily carried his point, through the might of his great name, and
      established their right to worship God in peace after their own harmless
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, his English army won such admiration in fighting with the French
      against the Spaniards, that, after they had assaulted the town of Dunkirk
      together, the French King in person gave it up to the English, that it
      might be a token to them of their might and valour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plots enough against Oliver among the frantic religionists (who
      called themselves Fifth Monarchy Men), and among the disappointed
      Republicans.&nbsp; He had a difficult game to play, for the Royalists were
      always ready to side with either party against him.&nbsp; The &lsquo;King
      over the water,&rsquo; too, as Charles was called, had no scruples about
      plotting with any one against his life; although there is reason to
      suppose that he would willingly have married one of his daughters, if
      Oliver would have had such a son-in-law.&nbsp; There was a certain <span
      class="smcap">Colonel Saxby</span> of the army, once a great supporter of
      Oliver&rsquo;s but now turned against him, who was a grievous trouble to
      him through all this part of his career; and who came and went between the
      discontented in England and Spain, and Charles who put himself in alliance
      with Spain on being thrown off by France.&nbsp; This man died in prison at
      last; but not until there had been very serious plots between the
      Royalists and Republicans, and an actual rising of them in England, when
      they burst into the city of Salisbury, on a Sunday night, seized the
      judges who were going to hold the assizes there next day, and would have
      hanged them but for the merciful objections of the more temperate of their
      number.&nbsp; Oliver was so vigorous and shrewd that he soon put this
      revolt down, as he did most other conspiracies; and it was well for one of
      its chief managers&mdash;that same Lord Wilmot who had assisted in Charles&rsquo;s
      flight, and was now <span class="smcap">Earl of Rochester</span>&mdash;that
      he made his escape.&nbsp; Oliver seemed to have eyes and ears everywhere,
      and secured such sources of information as his enemies little dreamed of.&nbsp;
      There was a chosen body of six persons, called the Sealed Knot, who were
      in the closest and most secret confidence of Charles.&nbsp; One of the
      foremost of these very men, a <span class="smcap">Sir Richard Willis</span>,
      reported to Oliver everything that passed among them, and had two hundred
      a year for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Miles Syndarcomb</span>, also of the old army, was
      another conspirator against the Protector.&nbsp; He and a man named <span
      class="smcap">Cecil</span>, bribed one of his Life Guards to let them have
      good notice when he was going out&mdash;intending to shoot him from a
      window.&nbsp; But, owing either to his caution or his good fortune, they
      could never get an aim at him.&nbsp; Disappointed in this design, they got
      into the chapel in Whitehall, with a basketful of combustibles, which were
      to explode by means of a slow match in six hours; then, in the noise and
      confusion of the fire, they hoped to kill Oliver.&nbsp; But, the Life
      Guardsman himself disclosed this plot; and they were seized, and Miles
      died (or killed himself in prison) a little while before he was ordered
      for execution.&nbsp; A few such plotters Oliver caused to be beheaded, a
      few more to be hanged, and many more, including those who rose in arms
      against him, to be sent as slaves to the West Indies.&nbsp; If he were
      rigid, he was impartial too, in asserting the laws of England.&nbsp; When
      a Portuguese nobleman, the brother of the Portuguese ambassador, killed a
      London citizen in mistake for another man with whom he had had a quarrel,
      Oliver caused him to be tried before a jury of Englishmen and foreigners,
      and had him executed in spite of the entreaties of all the ambassadors in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Oliver&rsquo;s own friends, the <span class="smcap">Duke of
      Oldenburgh</span>, in sending him a present of six fine coach-horses, was
      very near doing more to please the Royalists than all the plotters put
      together.&nbsp; One day, Oliver went with his coach, drawn by these six
      horses, into Hyde Park, to dine with his secretary and some of his other
      gentlemen under the trees there.&nbsp; After dinner, being merry, he took
      it into his head to put his friends inside and to drive them home: a
      postillion riding one of the foremost horses, as the custom was.&nbsp; On
      account of Oliver&rsquo;s being too free with the whip, the six fine
      horses went off at a gallop, the postillion got thrown, and Oliver fell
      upon the coach-pole and narrowly escaped being shot by his own pistol,
      which got entangled with his clothes in the harness, and went off.&nbsp;
      He was dragged some distance by the foot, until his foot came out of the
      shoe, and then he came safely to the ground under the broad body of the
      coach, and was very little the worse.&nbsp; The gentlemen inside were only
      bruised, and the discontented people of all parties were much
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the history of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell is a
      history of his Parliaments.&nbsp; His first one not pleasing him at all,
      he waited until the five months were out, and then dissolved it.&nbsp; The
      next was better suited to his views; and from that he desired to get&mdash;if
      he could with safety to himself&mdash;the title of King.&nbsp; He had had
      this in his mind some time: whether because he thought that the English
      people, being more used to the title, were more likely to obey it; or
      whether because he really wished to be a king himself, and to leave the
      succession to that title in his family, is far from clear.&nbsp; He was
      already as high, in England and in all the world, as he would ever be, and
      I doubt if he cared for the mere name.&nbsp; However, a paper, called the
      &lsquo;Humble Petition and Advice,&rsquo; was presented to him by the
      House of Commons, praying him to take a high title and to appoint his
      successor.&nbsp; That he would have taken the title of King there is no
      doubt, but for the strong opposition of the army.&nbsp; This induced him
      to forbear, and to assent only to the other points of the petition.&nbsp;
      Upon which occasion there was another grand show in Westminster Hall, when
      the Speaker of the House of Commons formally invested him with a purple
      robe lined with ermine, and presented him with a splendidly bound Bible,
      and put a golden sceptre in his hand.&nbsp; The next time the Parliament
      met, he called a House of Lords of sixty members, as the petition gave him
      power to do; but as that Parliament did not please him either, and would
      not proceed to the business of the country, he jumped into a coach one
      morning, took six Guards with him, and sent them to the right-about.&nbsp;
      I wish this had been a warning to Parliaments to avoid long speeches, and
      do more work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the month of August, one thousand six hundred and fifty-eight, when
      Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s favourite daughter, <span class="smcap">Elizabeth
      Claypole</span> (who had lately lost her youngest son), lay very ill, and
      his mind was greatly troubled, because he loved her dearly.&nbsp; Another
      of his daughters was married to <span class="smcap">Lord Falconberg</span>,
      another to the grandson of the Earl of Warwick, and he had made his son
      <span class="smcap">Richard</span> one of the Members of the Upper House.&nbsp;
      He was very kind and loving to them all, being a good father and a good
      husband; but he loved this daughter the best of the family, and went down
      to Hampton Court to see her, and could hardly be induced to stir from her
      sick room until she died.&nbsp; Although his religion had been of a gloomy
      kind, his disposition had been always cheerful.&nbsp; He had been fond of
      music in his home, and had kept open table once a week for all officers of
      the army not below the rank of captain, and had always preserved in his
      house a quiet, sensible dignity.&nbsp; He encouraged men of genius and
      learning, and loved to have them about him.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Milton</span>
      was one of his great friends.&nbsp; He was good humoured too, with the
      nobility, whose dresses and manners were very different from his; and to
      show them what good information he had, he would sometimes jokingly tell
      them when they were his guests, where they had last drunk the health of
      the &lsquo;King over the water,&rsquo; and would recommend them to be more
      private (if they could) another time.&nbsp; But he had lived in busy
      times, had borne the weight of heavy State affairs, and had often gone in
      fear of his life.&nbsp; He was ill of the gout and ague; and when the
      death of his beloved child came upon him in addition, he sank, never to
      raise his head again.&nbsp; He told his physicians on the twenty-fourth of
      August that the Lord had assured him that he was not to die in that
      illness, and that he would certainly get better.&nbsp; This was only his
      sick fancy, for on the third of September, which was the anniversary of
      the great battle of Worcester, and the day of the year which he called his
      fortunate day, he died, in the sixtieth year of his age.&nbsp; He had been
      delirious, and had lain insensible some hours, but he had been overheard
      to murmur a very good prayer the day before.&nbsp; The whole country
      lamented his death.&nbsp; If you want to know the real worth of Oliver
      Cromwell, and his real services to his country, you can hardly do better
      than compare England under him, with England under <span class="smcap">Charles
      the Second</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had appointed his son Richard to succeed him, and after there had been,
      at Somerset House in the Strand, a lying in state more splendid than
      sensible&mdash;as all such vanities after death are, I think&mdash;Richard
      became Lord Protector.&nbsp; He was an amiable country gentleman, but had
      none of his father&rsquo;s great genius, and was quite unfit for such a
      post in such a storm of parties.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s Protectorate, which
      only lasted a year and a half, is a history of quarrels between the
      officers of the army and the Parliament, and between the officers among
      themselves; and of a growing discontent among the people, who had far too
      many long sermons and far too few amusements, and wanted a change.&nbsp;
      At last, General Monk got the army well into his own hands, and then in
      pursuance of a secret plan he seems to have entertained from the time of
      Oliver&rsquo;s death, declared for the King&rsquo;s cause.&nbsp; He did
      not do this openly; but, in his place in the House of Commons, as one of
      the members for Devonshire, strongly advocated the proposals of one <span
      class="smcap">Sir John Greenville</span>, who came to the House with a
      letter from Charles, dated from Breda, and with whom he had previously
      been in secret communication.&nbsp; There had been plots and counterplots,
      and a recall of the last members of the Long Parliament, and an end of the
      Long Parliament, and risings of the Royalists that were made too soon; and
      most men being tired out, and there being no one to head the country now
      great Oliver was dead, it was readily agreed to welcome Charles Stuart.&nbsp;
      Some of the wiser and better members said&mdash;what was most true&mdash;that
      in the letter from Breda, he gave no real promise to govern well, and that
      it would be best to make him pledge himself beforehand as to what he
      should be bound to do for the benefit of the kingdom.&nbsp; Monk said,
      however, it would be all right when he came, and he could not come too
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, everybody found out all in a moment that the country <i>must</i> be
      prosperous and happy, having another Stuart to condescend to reign over
      it; and there was a prodigious firing off of guns, lighting of bonfires,
      ringing of bells, and throwing up of caps.&nbsp; The people drank the King&rsquo;s
      health by thousands in the open streets, and everybody rejoiced.&nbsp;
      Down came the Arms of the Commonwealth, up went the Royal Arms instead,
      and out came the public money.&nbsp; Fifty thousand pounds for the King,
      ten thousand pounds for his brother the Duke of York, five thousand pounds
      for his brother the Duke of Gloucester.&nbsp; Prayers for these gracious
      Stuarts were put up in all the churches; commissioners were sent to
      Holland (which suddenly found out that Charles was a great man, and that
      it loved him) to invite the King home; Monk and the Kentish grandees went
      to Dover, to kneel down before him as he landed.&nbsp; He kissed and
      embraced Monk, made him ride in the coach with himself and his brothers,
      came on to London amid wonderful shoutings, and passed through the army at
      Blackheath on the twenty-ninth of May (his birthday), in the year one
      thousand six hundred and sixty.&nbsp; Greeted by splendid dinners under
      tents, by flags and tapestry streaming from all the houses, by delighted
      crowds in all the streets, by troops of noblemen and gentlemen in rich
      dresses, by City companies, train-bands, drummers, trumpeters, the great
      Lord Mayor, and the majestic Aldermen, the King went on to Whitehall.&nbsp;
      On entering it, he commemorated his Restoration with the joke that it
      really would seem to have been his own fault that he had not come long
      ago, since everybody told him that he had always wished for him with all
      his heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE SECOND, CALLED THE MERRY
      MONARCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      There never were such profligate times in England as under Charles the
      Second.&nbsp; Whenever you see his portrait, with his swarthy, ill-looking
      face and great nose, you may fancy him in his Court at Whitehall,
      surrounded by some of the very worst vagabonds in the kingdom (though they
      were lords and ladies), drinking, gambling, indulging in vicious
      conversation, and committing every kind of profligate excess.&nbsp; It has
      been a fashion to call Charles the Second &lsquo;The Merry Monarch.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      Let me try to give you a general idea of some of the merry things that
      were done, in the merry days when this merry gentleman sat upon his merry
      throne, in merry England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first merry proceeding was&mdash;of course&mdash;to declare that he
      was one of the greatest, the wisest, and the noblest kings that ever
      shone, like the blessed sun itself, on this benighted earth.&nbsp; The
      next merry and pleasant piece of business was, for the Parliament, in the
      humblest manner, to give him one million two hundred thousand pounds a
      year, and to settle upon him for life that old disputed tonnage and
      poundage which had been so bravely fought for.&nbsp; Then, General Monk
      being made <span class="smcap">Earl of Albemarle</span>, and a few other
      Royalists similarly rewarded, the law went to work to see what was to be
      done to those persons (they were called Regicides) who had been concerned
      in making a martyr of the late King.&nbsp; Ten of these were merrily
      executed; that is to say, six of the judges, one of the council, Colonel
      Hacker and another officer who had commanded the Guards, and <span
      class="smcap">Hugh Peters</span>, a preacher who had preached against the
      martyr with all his heart.&nbsp; These executions were so extremely merry,
      that every horrible circumstance which Cromwell had abandoned was revived
      with appalling cruelty.&nbsp; The hearts of the sufferers were torn out of
      their living bodies; their bowels were burned before their faces; the
      executioner cut jokes to the next victim, as he rubbed his filthy hands
      together, that were reeking with the blood of the last; and the heads of
      the dead were drawn on sledges with the living to the place of suffering.&nbsp;
      Still, even so merry a monarch could not force one of these dying men to
      say that he was sorry for what he had done.&nbsp; Nay, the most memorable
      thing said among them was, that if the thing were to do again they would
      do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Harry Vane, who had furnished the evidence against Strafford, and was
      one of the most staunch of the Republicans, was also tried, found guilty,
      and ordered for execution.&nbsp; When he came upon the scaffold on Tower
      Hill, after conducting his own defence with great power, his notes of what
      he had meant to say to the people were torn away from him, and the drums
      and trumpets were ordered to sound lustily and drown his voice; for, the
      people had been so much impressed by what the Regicides had calmly said
      with their last breath, that it was the custom now, to have the drums and
      trumpets always under the scaffold, ready to strike up.&nbsp; Vane said no
      more than this: &lsquo;It is a bad cause which cannot bear the words of a
      dying man:&rsquo; and bravely died.
    </p>
    <p>
      These merry scenes were succeeded by another, perhaps even merrier.&nbsp;
      On the anniversary of the late King&rsquo;s death, the bodies of Oliver
      Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw, were torn out of their graves in
      Westminster Abbey, dragged to Tyburn, hanged there on a gallows all day
      long, and then beheaded.&nbsp; Imagine the head of Oliver Cromwell set
      upon a pole to be stared at by a brutal crowd, not one of whom would have
      dared to look the living Oliver in the face for half a moment!&nbsp;
      Think, after you have read this reign, what England was under Oliver
      Cromwell who was torn out of his grave, and what it was under this merry
      monarch who sold it, like a merry Judas, over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the remains of Oliver&rsquo;s wife and daughter were not to be
      spared either, though they had been most excellent women.&nbsp; The base
      clergy of that time gave up their bodies, which had been buried in the
      Abbey, and&mdash;to the eternal disgrace of England&mdash;they were thrown
      into a pit, together with the mouldering bones of Pym and of the brave and
      bold old Admiral Blake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergy acted this disgraceful part because they hoped to get the
      nonconformists, or dissenters, thoroughly put down in this reign, and to
      have but one prayer-book and one service for all kinds of people, no
      matter what their private opinions were.&nbsp; This was pretty well, I
      think, for a Protestant Church, which had displaced the Romish Church
      because people had a right to their own opinions in religious matters.&nbsp;
      However, they carried it with a high hand, and a prayer-book was agreed
      upon, in which the extremest opinions of Archbishop Laud were not
      forgotten.&nbsp; An Act was passed, too, preventing any dissenter from
      holding any office under any corporation.&nbsp; So, the regular clergy in
      their triumph were soon as merry as the King.&nbsp; The army being by this
      time disbanded, and the King crowned, everything was to go on easily for
      evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must say a word here about the King&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; He had not
      been long upon the throne when his brother the Duke of Gloucester, and his
      sister the <span class="smcap">Princess of Orange</span>, died within a
      few months of each other, of small-pox.&nbsp; His remaining sister, the
      <span class="smcap">Princess Henrietta</span>, married the <span
      class="smcap">Duke of Orleans</span>, the brother of <span class="smcap">Louis
      the Fourteenth</span>, King of France.&nbsp; His brother <span
      class="smcap">James</span>, <span class="smcap">Duke of York</span>, was
      made High Admiral, and by-and-by became a Catholic.&nbsp; He was a gloomy,
      sullen, bilious sort of man, with a remarkable partiality for the ugliest
      women in the country.&nbsp; He married, under very discreditable
      circumstances, <span class="smcap">Anne Hyde</span>, the daughter of <span
      class="smcap">Lord Clarendon</span>, then the King&rsquo;s principal
      Minister&mdash;not at all a delicate minister either, but doing much of
      the dirty work of a very dirty palace.&nbsp; It became important now that
      the King himself should be married; and divers foreign Monarchs, not very
      particular about the character of their son-in-law, proposed their
      daughters to him.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">King of Portugal</span>
      offered his daughter, <span class="smcap">Catherine of Braganza</span>,
      and fifty thousand pounds: in addition to which, the French King, who was
      favourable to that match, offered a loan of another fifty thousand.&nbsp;
      The King of Spain, on the other hand, offered any one out of a dozen of
      Princesses, and other hopes of gain.&nbsp; But the ready money carried the
      day, and Catherine came over in state to her merry marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole Court was a great flaunting crowd of debauched men and shameless
      women; and Catherine&rsquo;s merry husband insulted and outraged her in
      every possible way, until she consented to receive those worthless
      creatures as her very good friends, and to degrade herself by their
      companionship.&nbsp; A <span class="smcap">Mrs. Palmer</span>, whom the
      King made <span class="smcap">Lady Castlemaine</span>, and afterwards
      <span class="smcap">Duchess of Cleveland</span>, was one of the most
      powerful of the bad women about the Court, and had great influence with
      the King nearly all through his reign.&nbsp; Another merry lady named
      <span class="smcap">Moll Davies</span>, a dancer at the theatre, was
      afterwards her rival.&nbsp; So was <span class="smcap">Nell Gwyn</span>,
      first an orange girl and then an actress, who really had good in her, and
      of whom one of the worst things I know is, that actually she does seem to
      have been fond of the King.&nbsp; The first <span class="smcap">Duke of
      St. Albans</span> was this orange girl&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; In like manner
      the son of a merry waiting-lady, whom the King created <span class="smcap">Duchess
      Of Portsmouth</span>, became the <span class="smcap">Duke of Richmond</span>.&nbsp;
      Upon the whole it is not so bad a thing to be a commoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Merry Monarch was so exceedingly merry among these merry ladies, and
      some equally merry (and equally infamous) lords and gentlemen, that he
      soon got through his hundred thousand pounds, and then, by way of raising
      a little pocket-money, made a merry bargain.&nbsp; He sold Dunkirk to the
      French King for five millions of livres.&nbsp; When I think of the dignity
      to which Oliver Cromwell raised England in the eyes of foreign powers, and
      when I think of the manner in which he gained for England this very
      Dunkirk, I am much inclined to consider that if the Merry Monarch had been
      made to follow his father for this action, he would have received his just
      deserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he was like his father in none of that father&rsquo;s greater
      qualities, he was like him in being worthy of no trust.&nbsp; When he sent
      that letter to the Parliament, from Breda, he did expressly promise that
      all sincere religious opinions should be respected.&nbsp; Yet he was no
      sooner firm in his power than he consented to one of the worst Acts of
      Parliament ever passed.&nbsp; Under this law, every minister who should
      not give his solemn assent to the Prayer-Book by a certain day, was
      declared to be a minister no longer, and to be deprived of his church.&nbsp;
      The consequence of this was that some two thousand honest men were taken
      from their congregations, and reduced to dire poverty and distress.&nbsp;
      It was followed by another outrageous law, called the Conventicle Act, by
      which any person above the age of sixteen who was present at any religious
      service not according to the Prayer-Book, was to be imprisoned three
      months for the first offence, six for the second, and to be transported
      for the third.&nbsp; This Act alone filled the prisons, which were then
      most dreadful dungeons, to overflowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Covenanters in Scotland had already fared no better.&nbsp; A base
      Parliament, usually known as the Drunken Parliament, in consequence of its
      principal members being seldom sober, had been got together to make laws
      against the Covenanters, and to force all men to be of one mind in
      religious matters.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Marquis of Argyle</span>,
      relying on the King&rsquo;s honour, had given himself up to him; but, he
      was wealthy, and his enemies wanted his wealth.&nbsp; He was tried for
      treason, on the evidence of some private letters in which he had expressed
      opinions&mdash;as well he might&mdash;more favourable to the government of
      the late Lord Protector than of the present merry and religious King.&nbsp;
      He was executed, as were two men of mark among the Covenanters; and <span
      class="smcap">Sharp</span>, a traitor who had once been the friend of the
      Presbyterians and betrayed them, was made Archbishop of St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
      to teach the Scotch how to like bishops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things being in this merry state at home, the Merry Monarch undertook a
      war with the Dutch; principally because they interfered with an African
      company, established with the two objects of buying gold-dust and slaves,
      of which the Duke of York was a leading member.&nbsp; After some
      preliminary hostilities, the said Duke sailed to the coast of Holland with
      a fleet of ninety-eight vessels of war, and four fire-ships.&nbsp; This
      engaged with the Dutch fleet, of no fewer than one hundred and thirteen
      ships.&nbsp; In the great battle between the two forces, the Dutch lost
      eighteen ships, four admirals, and seven thousand men.&nbsp; But, the
      English on shore were in no mood of exultation when they heard the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, this was the year and the time of the Great Plague in London.&nbsp;
      During the winter of one thousand six hundred and sixty-four it had been
      whispered about, that some few people had died here and there of the
      disease called the Plague, in some of the unwholesome suburbs around
      London.&nbsp; News was not published at that time as it is now, and some
      people believed these rumours, and some disbelieved them, and they were
      soon forgotten.&nbsp; But, in the month of May, one thousand six hundred
      and sixty-five, it began to be said all over the town that the disease had
      burst out with great violence in St. Giles&rsquo;s, and that the people
      were dying in great numbers.&nbsp; This soon turned out to be awfully
      true.&nbsp; The roads out of London were choked up by people endeavouring
      to escape from the infected city, and large sums were paid for any kind of
      conveyance.&nbsp; The disease soon spread so fast, that it was necessary
      to shut up the houses in which sick people were, and to cut them off from
      communication with the living.&nbsp; Every one of these houses was marked
      on the outside of the door with a red cross, and the words, Lord, have
      mercy upon us!&nbsp; The streets were all deserted, grass grew in the
      public ways, and there was a dreadful silence in the air.&nbsp; When night
      came on, dismal rumblings used to be heard, and these were the wheels of
      the death-carts, attended by men with veiled faces and holding cloths to
      their mouths, who rang doleful bells and cried in a loud and solemn voice,
      &lsquo;Bring out your dead!&rsquo;&nbsp; The corpses put into these carts
      were buried by torchlight in great pits; no service being performed over
      them; all men being afraid to stay for a moment on the brink of the
      ghastly graves.&nbsp; In the general fear, children ran away from their
      parents, and parents from their children.&nbsp; Some who were taken ill,
      died alone, and without any help.&nbsp; Some were stabbed or strangled by
      hired nurses who robbed them of all their money, and stole the very beds
      on which they lay.&nbsp; Some went mad, dropped from the windows, ran
      through the streets, and in their pain and frenzy flung themselves into
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were not all the horrors of the time.&nbsp; The wicked and
      dissolute, in wild desperation, sat in the taverns singing roaring songs,
      and were stricken as they drank, and went out and died.&nbsp; The fearful
      and superstitious persuaded themselves that they saw supernatural sights&mdash;burning
      swords in the sky, gigantic arms and darts.&nbsp; Others pretended that at
      nights vast crowds of ghosts walked round and round the dismal pits.&nbsp;
      One madman, naked, and carrying a brazier full of burning coals upon his
      head, stalked through the streets, crying out that he was a Prophet,
      commissioned to denounce the vengeance of the Lord on wicked London.&nbsp;
      Another always went to and fro, exclaiming, &lsquo;Yet forty days, and
      London shall be destroyed!&rsquo;&nbsp; A third awoke the echoes in the
      dismal streets, by night and by day, and made the blood of the sick run
      cold, by calling out incessantly, in a deep hoarse voice, &lsquo;O, the
      great and dreadful God!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the months of July and August and September, the Great Plague
      raged more and more.&nbsp; Great fires were lighted in the streets, in the
      hope of stopping the infection; but there was a plague of rain too, and it
      beat the fires out.&nbsp; At last, the winds which usually arise at that
      time of the year which is called the equinox, when day and night are of
      equal length all over the world, began to blow, and to purify the wretched
      town.&nbsp; The deaths began to decrease, the red crosses slowly to
      disappear, the fugitives to return, the shops to open, pale frightened
      faces to be seen in the streets.&nbsp; The Plague had been in every part
      of England, but in close and unwholesome London it had killed one hundred
      thousand people.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, the Merry Monarch was as merry as ever, and as worthless as
      ever.&nbsp; All this time, the debauched lords and gentlemen and the
      shameless ladies danced and gamed and drank, and loved and hated one
      another, according to their merry ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      So little humanity did the government learn from the late affliction, that
      one of the first things the Parliament did when it met at Oxford (being as
      yet afraid to come to London), was to make a law, called the Five Mile
      Act, expressly directed against those poor ministers who, in the time of
      the Plague, had manfully come back to comfort the unhappy people.&nbsp;
      This infamous law, by forbidding them to teach in any school, or to come
      within five miles of any city, town, or village, doomed them to starvation
      and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fleet had been at sea, and healthy.&nbsp; The King of France was now
      in alliance with the Dutch, though his navy was chiefly employed in
      looking on while the English and Dutch fought.&nbsp; The Dutch gained one
      victory; and the English gained another and a greater; and Prince Rupert,
      one of the English admirals, was out in the Channel one windy night,
      looking for the French Admiral, with the intention of giving him something
      more to do than he had had yet, when the gale increased to a storm, and
      blew him into Saint Helen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That night was the third of
      September, one thousand six hundred and sixty-six, and that wind fanned
      the Great Fire of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It broke out at a baker&rsquo;s shop near London Bridge, on the spot on
      which the Monument now stands as a remembrance of those raging flames.&nbsp;
      It spread and spread, and burned and burned, for three days.&nbsp; The
      nights were lighter than the days; in the daytime there was an immense
      cloud of smoke, and in the night-time there was a great tower of fire
      mounting up into the sky, which lighted the whole country landscape for
      ten miles round.&nbsp; Showers of hot ashes rose into the air and fell on
      distant places; flying sparks carried the conflagration to great
      distances, and kindled it in twenty new spots at a time; church steeples
      fell down with tremendous crashes; houses crumbled into cinders by the
      hundred and the thousand.&nbsp; The summer had been intensely hot and dry,
      the streets were very narrow, and the houses mostly built of wood and
      plaster.&nbsp; Nothing could stop the tremendous fire, but the want of
      more houses to burn; nor did it stop until the whole way from the Tower to
      Temple Bar was a desert, composed of the ashes of thirteen thousand houses
      and eighty-nine churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a terrible visitation at the time, and occasioned great loss and
      suffering to the two hundred thousand burnt-out people, who were obliged
      to lie in the fields under the open night sky, or in hastily-made huts of
      mud and straw, while the lanes and roads were rendered impassable by carts
      which had broken down as they tried to save their goods.&nbsp; But the
      Fire was a great blessing to the City afterwards, for it arose from its
      ruins very much improved&mdash;built more regularly, more widely, more
      cleanly and carefully, and therefore much more healthily.&nbsp; It might
      be far more healthy than it is, but there are some people in it still&mdash;even
      now, at this time, nearly two hundred years later&mdash;so selfish, so
      pig-headed, and so ignorant, that I doubt if even another Great Fire would
      warm them up to do their duty.

      The Catholics were accused of having wilfully set London in flames; one
      poor Frenchman, who had been mad for years, even accused himself of having
      with his own hand fired the first house.&nbsp; There is no reasonable
      doubt, however, that the fire was accidental.&nbsp; An inscription on the
      Monument long attributed it to the Catholics; but it is removed now, and
      was always a malicious and stupid untruth.

    <h3>
      SECOND PART
    </h3>
    <p>
      That the Merry Monarch might be very merry indeed, in the merry times when
      his people were suffering under pestilence and fire, he drank and gambled
      and flung away among his favourites the money which the Parliament had
      voted for the war.&nbsp; The consequence of this was that the
      stout-hearted English sailors were merrily starving of want, and dying in
      the streets; while the Dutch, under their admirals <span class="smcap">De
      Witt</span> and <span class="smcap">De Ruyter</span>, came into the River
      Thames, and up the River Medway as far as Upnor, burned the guard-ships,
      silenced the weak batteries, and did what they would to the English coast
      for six whole weeks.&nbsp; Most of the English ships that could have
      prevented them had neither powder nor shot on board; in this merry reign,
      public officers made themselves as merry as the King did with the public
      money; and when it was entrusted to them to spend in national defences or
      preparations, they put it into their own pockets with the merriest grace
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clarendon had, by this time, run as long a course as is usually
      allotted to the unscrupulous ministers of bad kings.&nbsp; He was
      impeached by his political opponents, but unsuccessfully.&nbsp; The King
      then commanded him to withdraw from England and retire to France, which he
      did, after defending himself in writing.&nbsp; He was no great loss at
      home, and died abroad some seven years afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      There then came into power a ministry called the Cabal Ministry, because
      it was composed of <span class="smcap">Lord Clifford</span>, the <span
      class="smcap">Earl of Arlington</span>, the <span class="smcap">Duke of
      Buckingham</span> (a great rascal, and the King&rsquo;s most powerful
      favourite), <span class="smcap">Lord Ashley</span>, and the <span
      class="smcap">Duke of Lauderdale</span>, <span class="smcap">c. a. b. a.
      l.</span>&nbsp; As the French were making conquests in Flanders, the first
      Cabal proceeding was to make a treaty with the Dutch, for uniting with
      Spain to oppose the French.&nbsp; It was no sooner made than the Merry
      Monarch, who always wanted to get money without being accountable to a
      Parliament for his expenditure, apologised to the King of France for
      having had anything to do with it, and concluded a secret treaty with him,
      making himself his infamous pensioner to the amount of two millions of
      livres down, and three millions more a year; and engaging to desert that
      very Spain, to make war against those very Dutch, and to declare himself a
      Catholic when a convenient time should arrive.&nbsp; This religious king
      had lately been crying to his Catholic brother on the subject of his
      strong desire to be a Catholic; and now he merrily concluded this
      treasonable conspiracy against the country he governed, by undertaking to
      become one as soon as he safely could.&nbsp; For all of which, though he
      had had ten merry heads instead of one, he richly deserved to lose them by
      the headsman&rsquo;s axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his one merry head might have been far from safe, if these things had
      been known, they were kept very quiet, and war was declared by France and
      England against the Dutch.&nbsp; But, a very uncommon man, afterwards most
      important to English history and to the religion and liberty of this land,
      arose among them, and for many long years defeated the whole projects of
      France.&nbsp; This was <span class="smcap">William of Nassau</span>, <span
      class="smcap">Prince of Orange</span>, son of the last Prince of Orange of
      the same name, who married the daughter of Charles the First of England.&nbsp;
      He was a young man at this time, only just of age; but he was brave, cool,
      intrepid, and wise.&nbsp; His father had been so detested that, upon his
      death, the Dutch had abolished the authority to which this son would have
      otherwise succeeded (Stadtholder it was called), and placed the chief
      power in the hands of <span class="smcap">John de Witt</span>, who
      educated this young prince.&nbsp; Now, the Prince became very popular, and
      John de Witt&rsquo;s brother <span class="smcap">Cornelius</span> was
      sentenced to banishment on a false accusation of conspiring to kill him.&nbsp;
      John went to the prison where he was, to take him away to exile, in his
      coach; and a great mob who collected on the occasion, then and there
      cruelly murdered both the brothers.&nbsp; This left the government in the
      hands of the Prince, who was really the choice of the nation; and from
      this time he exercised it with the greatest vigour, against the whole
      power of France, under its famous generals <span class="smcap">Cond&eacute;</span>
      and <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>, and in support of the Protestant
      religion.&nbsp; It was full seven years before this war ended in a treaty
      of peace made at Nimeguen, and its details would occupy a very
      considerable space.&nbsp; It is enough to say that William of Orange
      established a famous character with the whole world; and that the Merry
      Monarch, adding to and improving on his former baseness, bound himself to
      do everything the King of France liked, and nothing the King of France did
      not like, for a pension of one hundred thousand pounds a year, which was
      afterwards doubled.&nbsp; Besides this, the King of France, by means of
      his corrupt ambassador&mdash;who wrote accounts of his proceedings in
      England, which are not always to be believed, I think&mdash;bought our
      English members of Parliament, as he wanted them.&nbsp; So, in point of
      fact, during a considerable portion of this merry reign, the King of
      France was the real King of this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a better time to come, and it was to come (though his royal
      uncle little thought so) through that very William, Prince of Orange.&nbsp;
      He came over to England, saw Mary, the elder daughter of the Duke of York,
      and married her.&nbsp; We shall see by-and-by what came of that marriage,
      and why it is never to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      This daughter was a Protestant, but her mother died a Catholic.&nbsp; She
      and her sister <span class="smcap">Anne</span>, also a Protestant, were
      the only survivors of eight children.&nbsp; Anne afterwards married <span
      class="smcap">George</span>, <span class="smcap">Prince of Denmark</span>,
      brother to the King of that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lest you should do the Merry Monarch the injustice of supposing that he
      was even good humoured (except when he had everything his own way), or
      that he was high spirited and honourable, I will mention here what was
      done to a member of the House of Commons, <span class="smcap">Sir John
      Coventry</span>.&nbsp; He made a remark in a debate about taxing the
      theatres, which gave the King offence.&nbsp; The King agreed with his
      illegitimate son, who had been born abroad, and whom he had made <span
      class="smcap">Duke of Monmouth</span>, to take the following merry
      vengeance.&nbsp; To waylay him at night, fifteen armed men to one, and to
      slit his nose with a penknife.&nbsp; Like master, like man.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s
      favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, was strongly suspected of setting on an
      assassin to murder the <span class="smcap">Duke of Ormond</span> as he was
      returning home from a dinner; and that Duke&rsquo;s spirited son, <span
      class="smcap">Lord Ossory</span>, was so persuaded of his guilt, that he
      said to him at Court, even as he stood beside the King, &lsquo;My lord, I
      know very well that you are at the bottom of this late attempt upon my
      father.&nbsp; But I give you warning, if he ever come to a violent end,
      his blood shall be upon you, and wherever I meet you I will pistol you!&nbsp;
      I will do so, though I find you standing behind the King&rsquo;s chair;
      and I tell you this in his Majesty&rsquo;s presence, that you may be quite
      sure of my doing what I threaten.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those were merry times
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fellow named <span class="smcap">Blood</span>, who was seized
      for making, with two companions, an audacious attempt to steal the crown,
      the globe, and sceptre, from the place where the jewels were kept in the
      Tower.&nbsp; This robber, who was a swaggering ruffian, being taken,
      declared that he was the man who had endeavoured to kill the Duke of
      Ormond, and that he had meant to kill the King too, but was overawed by
      the majesty of his appearance, when he might otherwise have done it, as he
      was bathing at Battersea.&nbsp; The King being but an ill-looking fellow,
      I don&rsquo;t believe a word of this.&nbsp; Whether he was flattered, or
      whether he knew that Buckingham had really set Blood on to murder the
      Duke, is uncertain.&nbsp; But it is quite certain that he pardoned this
      thief, gave him an estate of five hundred a year in Ireland (which had had
      the honour of giving him birth), and presented him at Court to the
      debauched lords and the shameless ladies, who made a great deal of him&mdash;as
      I have no doubt they would have made of the Devil himself, if the King had
      introduced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infamously pensioned as he was, the King still wanted money, and
      consequently was obliged to call Parliaments.&nbsp; In these, the great
      object of the Protestants was to thwart the Catholic Duke of York, who
      married a second time; his new wife being a young lady only fifteen years
      old, the Catholic sister of the <span class="smcap">Duke of Modena</span>.&nbsp;
      In this they were seconded by the Protestant Dissenters, though to their
      own disadvantage: since, to exclude Catholics from power, they were even
      willing to exclude themselves.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s object was to
      pretend to be a Protestant, while he was really a Catholic; to swear to
      the bishops that he was devoutly attached to the English Church, while he
      knew he had bargained it away to the King of France; and by cheating and
      deceiving them, and all who were attached to royalty, to become despotic
      and be powerful enough to confess what a rascal he was.&nbsp; Meantime,
      the King of France, knowing his merry pensioner well, intrigued with the
      King&rsquo;s opponents in Parliament, as well as with the King and his
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fears that the country had of the Catholic religion being restored, if
      the Duke of York should come to the throne, and the low cunning of the
      King in pretending to share their alarms, led to some very terrible
      results.&nbsp; A certain <span class="smcap">Dr. Tonge</span>, a dull
      clergyman in the City, fell into the hands of a certain <span class="smcap">Titus
      Oates</span>, a most infamous character, who pretended to have acquired
      among the Jesuits abroad a knowledge of a great plot for the murder of the
      King, and the re-establishment if the Catholic religion.&nbsp; Titus
      Oates, being produced by this unlucky Dr. Tonge and solemnly examined
      before the council, contradicted himself in a thousand ways, told the most
      ridiculous and improbable stories, and implicated <span class="smcap">Coleman</span>,
      the Secretary of the Duchess of York.&nbsp; Now, although what he charged
      against Coleman was not true, and although you and I know very well that
      the real dangerous Catholic plot was that one with the King of France of
      which the Merry Monarch was himself the head, there happened to be found
      among Coleman&rsquo;s papers, some letters, in which he did praise the
      days of Bloody Queen Mary, and abuse the Protestant religion.&nbsp; This
      was great good fortune for Titus, as it seemed to confirm him; but better
      still was in store.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Sir Edmundbury Godfrey</span>,
      the magistrate who had first examined him, being unexpectedly found dead
      near Primrose Hill, was confidently believed to have been killed by the
      Catholics.&nbsp; I think there is no doubt that he had been melancholy
      mad, and that he killed himself; but he had a great Protestant funeral,
      and Titus was called the Saver of the Nation, and received a pension of
      twelve hundred pounds a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Oates&rsquo;s wickedness had met with this success, up started
      another villain, named <span class="smcap">William Bedloe</span>, who,
      attracted by a reward of five hundred pounds offered for the apprehension
      of the murderers of Godfrey, came forward and charged two Jesuits and some
      other persons with having committed it at the Queen&rsquo;s desire.&nbsp;
      Oates, going into partnership with this new informer, had the audacity to
      accuse the poor Queen herself of high treason.&nbsp; Then appeared a third
      informer, as bad as either of the two, and accused a Catholic banker named
      <span class="smcap">Stayley</span> of having said that the King was the
      greatest rogue in the world (which would not have been far from the
      truth), and that he would kill him with his own hand.&nbsp; This banker,
      being at once tried and executed, Coleman and two others were tried and
      executed.&nbsp; Then, a miserable wretch named <span class="smcap">Prance</span>,
      a Catholic silversmith, being accused by Bedloe, was tortured into
      confessing that he had taken part in Godfrey&rsquo;s murder, and into
      accusing three other men of having committed it.&nbsp; Then, five Jesuits
      were accused by Oates, Bedloe, and Prance together, and were all found
      guilty, and executed on the same kind of contradictory and absurd
      evidence.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s physician and three monks were next put
      on their trial; but Oates and Bedloe had for the time gone far enough and
      these four were acquitted.&nbsp; The public mind, however, was so full of
      a Catholic plot, and so strong against the Duke of York, that James
      consented to obey a written order from his brother, and to go with his
      family to Brussels, provided that his rights should never be sacrificed in
      his absence to the Duke of Monmouth.&nbsp; The House of Commons, not
      satisfied with this as the King hoped, passed a bill to exclude the Duke
      from ever succeeding to the throne.&nbsp; In return, the King dissolved
      the Parliament.&nbsp; He had deserted his old favourite, the Duke of
      Buckingham, who was now in the opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give any sufficient idea of the miseries of Scotland in this merry
      reign, would occupy a hundred pages.&nbsp; Because the people would not
      have bishops, and were resolved to stand by their solemn League and
      Covenant, such cruelties were inflicted upon them as make the blood run
      cold.&nbsp; Ferocious dragoons galloped through the country to punish the
      peasants for deserting the churches; sons were hanged up at their fathers&rsquo;
      doors for refusing to disclose where their fathers were concealed; wives
      were tortured to death for not betraying their husbands; people were taken
      out of their fields and gardens, and shot on the public roads without
      trial; lighted matches were tied to the fingers of prisoners, and a most
      horrible torment called the Boot was invented, and constantly applied,
      which ground and mashed the victims&rsquo; legs with iron wedges.&nbsp;
      Witnesses were tortured as well as prisoners.&nbsp; All the prisons were
      full; all the gibbets were heavy with bodies; murder and plunder
      devastated the whole country.&nbsp; In spite of all, the Covenanters were
      by no means to be dragged into the churches, and persisted in worshipping
      God as they thought right.&nbsp; A body of ferocious Highlanders, turned
      upon them from the mountains of their own country, had no greater effect
      than the English dragoons under <span class="smcap">Grahame of Claverhouse</span>,
      the most cruel and rapacious of all their enemies, whose name will ever be
      cursed through the length and breadth of Scotland.&nbsp; Archbishop Sharp
      had ever aided and abetted all these outrages.&nbsp; But he fell at last;
      for, when the injuries of the Scottish people were at their height, he was
      seen, in his coach-and-six coming across a moor, by a body of men, headed
      by one <span class="smcap">John Balfour</span>, who were waiting for
      another of their oppressors.&nbsp; Upon this they cried out that Heaven
      had delivered him into their hands, and killed him with many wounds.&nbsp;
      If ever a man deserved such a death, I think Archbishop Sharp did.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made a great noise directly, and the Merry Monarch&mdash;strongly
      suspected of having goaded the Scottish people on, that he might have an
      excuse for a greater army than the Parliament were willing to give him&mdash;sent
      down his son, the Duke of Monmouth, as commander-in-chief, with
      instructions to attack the Scottish rebels, or Whigs as they were called,
      whenever he came up with them.&nbsp; Marching with ten thousand men from
      Edinburgh, he found them, in number four or five thousand, drawn up at
      Bothwell Bridge, by the Clyde.&nbsp; They were soon dispersed; and
      Monmouth showed a more humane character towards them, than he had shown
      towards that Member of Parliament whose nose he had caused to be slit with
      a penknife.&nbsp; But the Duke of Lauderdale was their bitter foe, and
      sent Claverhouse to finish them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Duke of York became more and more unpopular, the Duke of Monmouth
      became more and more popular.&nbsp; It would have been decent in the
      latter not to have voted in favour of the renewed bill for the exclusion
      of James from the throne; but he did so, much to the King&rsquo;s
      amusement, who used to sit in the House of Lords by the fire, hearing the
      debates, which he said were as good as a play.&nbsp; The House of Commons
      passed the bill by a large majority, and it was carried up to the House of
      Lords by <span class="smcap">Lord Russell</span>, one of the best of the
      leaders on the Protestant side.&nbsp; It was rejected there, chiefly
      because the bishops helped the King to get rid of it; and the fear of
      Catholic plots revived again.&nbsp; There had been another got up, by a
      fellow out of Newgate, named <span class="smcap">Dangerfield</span>, which
      is more famous than it deserves to be, under the name of the <span
      class="smcap">Meal-Tub Plot</span>.&nbsp; This jail-bird having been got
      out of Newgate by a <span class="smcap">Mrs. Cellier</span>, a Catholic
      nurse, had turned Catholic himself, and pretended that he knew of a plot
      among the Presbyterians against the King&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; This was very
      pleasant to the Duke of York, who hated the Presbyterians, who returned
      the compliment.&nbsp; He gave Dangerfield twenty guineas, and sent him to
      the King his brother.&nbsp; But Dangerfield, breaking down altogether in
      his charge, and being sent back to Newgate, almost astonished the Duke out
      of his five senses by suddenly swearing that the Catholic nurse had put
      that false design into his head, and that what he really knew about, was,
      a Catholic plot against the King; the evidence of which would be found in
      some papers, concealed in a meal-tub in Mrs. Cellier&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
      There they were, of course&mdash;for he had put them there himself&mdash;and
      so the tub gave the name to the plot.&nbsp; But, the nurse was acquitted
      on her trial, and it came to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ashley, of the Cabal, was now Lord Shaftesbury, and was strong
      against the succession of the Duke of York.&nbsp; The House of Commons,
      aggravated to the utmost extent, as we may well suppose, by suspicions of
      the King&rsquo;s conspiracy with the King of France, made a desperate
      point of the exclusion, still, and were bitter against the Catholics
      generally.&nbsp; So unjustly bitter were they, I grieve to say, that they
      impeached the venerable Lord Stafford, a Catholic nobleman seventy years
      old, of a design to kill the King.&nbsp; The witnesses were that atrocious
      Oates and two other birds of the same feather.&nbsp; He was found guilty,
      on evidence quite as foolish as it was false, and was beheaded on Tower
      Hill.&nbsp; The people were opposed to him when he first appeared upon the
      scaffold; but, when he had addressed them and shown them how innocent he
      was and how wickedly he was sent there, their better nature was aroused,
      and they said, &lsquo;We believe you, my Lord.&nbsp; God bless you, my
      Lord!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The House of Commons refused to let the King have any money until he
      should consent to the Exclusion Bill; but, as he could get it and did get
      it from his master the King of France, he could afford to hold them very
      cheap.&nbsp; He called a Parliament at Oxford, to which he went down with
      a great show of being armed and protected as if he were in danger of his
      life, and to which the opposition members also went armed and protected,
      alleging that they were in fear of the Papists, who were numerous among
      the King&rsquo;s guards.&nbsp; However, they went on with the Exclusion
      Bill, and were so earnest upon it that they would have carried it again,
      if the King had not popped his crown and state robes into a sedan-chair,
      bundled himself into it along with them, hurried down to the chamber where
      the House of Lords met, and dissolved the Parliament.&nbsp; After which he
      scampered home, and the members of Parliament scampered home too, as fast
      as their legs could carry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of York, then residing in Scotland, had, under the law which
      excluded Catholics from public trust, no right whatever to public
      employment.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he was openly employed as the King&rsquo;s
      representative in Scotland, and there gratified his sullen and cruel
      nature to his heart&rsquo;s content by directing the dreadful cruelties
      against the Covenanters.&nbsp; There were two ministers named <span
      class="smcap">Cargill</span> and <span class="smcap">Cameron</span> who
      had escaped from the battle of Bothwell Bridge, and who returned to
      Scotland, and raised the miserable but still brave and unsubdued
      Covenanters afresh, under the name of Cameronians.&nbsp; As Cameron
      publicly posted a declaration that the King was a forsworn tyrant, no
      mercy was shown to his unhappy followers after he was slain in battle.&nbsp;
      The Duke of York, who was particularly fond of the Boot and derived great
      pleasure from having it applied, offered their lives to some of these
      people, if they would cry on the scaffold &lsquo;God save the King!&rsquo;&nbsp;
      But their relations, friends, and countrymen, had been so barbarously
      tortured and murdered in this merry reign, that they preferred to die, and
      did die.&nbsp; The Duke then obtained his merry brother&rsquo;s permission
      to hold a Parliament in Scotland, which first, with most shameless deceit,
      confirmed the laws for securing the Protestant religion against Popery,
      and then declared that nothing must or should prevent the succession of
      the Popish Duke.&nbsp; After this double-faced beginning, it established
      an oath which no human being could understand, but which everybody was to
      take, as a proof that his religion was the lawful religion.&nbsp; The Earl
      of Argyle, taking it with the explanation that he did not consider it to
      prevent him from favouring any alteration either in the Church or State
      which was not inconsistent with the Protestant religion or with his
      loyalty, was tried for high treason before a Scottish jury of which the
      <span class="smcap">Marquis of Montrose</span> was foreman, and was found
      guilty.&nbsp; He escaped the scaffold, for that time, by getting away, in
      the disguise of a page, in the train of his daughter, <span class="smcap">Lady
      Sophia Lindsay</span>.&nbsp; It was absolutely proposed, by certain
      members of the Scottish Council, that this lady should be whipped through
      the streets of Edinburgh.&nbsp; But this was too much even for the Duke,
      who had the manliness then (he had very little at most times) to remark
      that Englishmen were not accustomed to treat ladies in that manner.&nbsp;
      In those merry times nothing could equal the brutal servility of the
      Scottish fawners, but the conduct of similar degraded beings in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the settlement of these little affairs, the Duke returned to
      England, and soon resumed his place at the Council, and his office of High
      Admiral&mdash;all this by his brother&rsquo;s favour, and in open defiance
      of the law.&nbsp; It would have been no loss to the country, if he had
      been drowned when his ship, in going to Scotland to fetch his family,
      struck on a sand-bank, and was lost with two hundred souls on board.&nbsp;
      But he escaped in a boat with some friends; and the sailors were so brave
      and unselfish, that, when they saw him rowing away, they gave three
      cheers, while they themselves were going down for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Merry Monarch, having got rid of his Parliament, went to work to make
      himself despotic, with all speed.&nbsp; Having had the villainy to order
      the execution of <span class="smcap">Oliver Plunket</span>, <span
      class="smcap">Bishop of Armagh</span>, falsely accused of a plot to
      establish Popery in that country by means of a French army&mdash;the very
      thing this royal traitor was himself trying to do at home&mdash;and having
      tried to ruin Lord Shaftesbury, and failed&mdash;he turned his hand to
      controlling the corporations all over the country; because, if he could
      only do that, he could get what juries he chose, to bring in perjured
      verdicts, and could get what members he chose returned to Parliament.&nbsp;
      These merry times produced, and made Chief Justice of the Court of King&rsquo;s
      Bench, a drunken ruffian of the name of <span class="smcap">Jeffreys</span>;
      a red-faced, swollen, bloated, horrible creature, with a bullying, roaring
      voice, and a more savage nature perhaps than was ever lodged in any human
      breast.&nbsp; This monster was the Merry Monarch&rsquo;s especial
      favourite, and he testified his admiration of him by giving him a ring
      from his own finger, which the people used to call Judge Jeffreys&rsquo;s
      Bloodstone.&nbsp; Him the King employed to go about and bully the
      corporations, beginning with London; or, as Jeffreys himself elegantly
      called it, &lsquo;to give them a lick with the rough side of his tongue.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      And he did it so thoroughly, that they soon became the basest and most
      sycophantic bodies in the kingdom&mdash;except the University of Oxford,
      which, in that respect, was quite pre-eminent and unapproachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Shaftesbury (who died soon after the King&rsquo;s failure against
      him), <span class="smcap">Lord William Russell</span>, the Duke of
      Monmouth, <span class="smcap">Lord Howard</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord
      Jersey</span>, <span class="smcap">Algernon Sidney</span>, <span
      class="smcap">John Hampden</span> (grandson of the great Hampden), and
      some others, used to hold a council together after the dissolution of the
      Parliament, arranging what it might be necessary to do, if the King
      carried his Popish plot to the utmost height.&nbsp; Lord Shaftesbury
      having been much the most violent of this party, brought two violent men
      into their secrets&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rumsey</span>, who had been a
      soldier in the Republican army; and <span class="smcap">West</span>, a
      lawyer.&nbsp; These two knew an old officer of <span class="smcap">Cromwell&rsquo;s</span>,
      called <span class="smcap">Rumbold</span>, who had married a maltster&rsquo;s
      widow, and so had come into possession of a solitary dwelling called the
      Rye House, near Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; Rumbold said to them
      what a capital place this house of his would be from which to shoot at the
      King, who often passed there going to and fro from Newmarket.&nbsp; They
      liked the idea, and entertained it.&nbsp; But, one of their body gave
      information; and they, together with <span class="smcap">Shepherd</span> a
      wine merchant, Lord Russell, Algernon Sidney, <span class="smcap">Lord
      Essex</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord Howard</span>, and Hampden, were
      all arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Russell might have easily escaped, but scorned to do so, being
      innocent of any wrong; Lord Essex might have easily escaped, but scorned
      to do so, lest his flight should prejudice Lord Russell.&nbsp; But it
      weighed upon his mind that he had brought into their council, Lord Howard&mdash;who
      now turned a miserable traitor&mdash;against a great dislike Lord Russell
      had always had of him.&nbsp; He could not bear the reflection, and
      destroyed himself before Lord Russell was brought to trial at the Old
      Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew very well that he had nothing to hope, having always been manful
      in the Protestant cause against the two false brothers, the one on the
      throne, and the other standing next to it.&nbsp; He had a wife, one of the
      noblest and best of women, who acted as his secretary on his trial, who
      comforted him in his prison, who supped with him on the night before he
      died, and whose love and virtue and devotion have made her name
      imperishable.&nbsp; Of course, he was found guilty, and was sentenced to
      be beheaded in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn-fields, not many yards from his own
      house.&nbsp; When he had parted from his children on the evening before
      his death, his wife still stayed with him until ten o&rsquo;clock at
      night; and when their final separation in this world was over, and he had
      kissed her many times, he still sat for a long while in his prison,
      talking of her goodness.&nbsp; Hearing the rain fall fast at that time, he
      calmly said, &lsquo;Such a rain to-morrow will spoil a great show, which
      is a dull thing on a rainy day.&rsquo;&nbsp; At midnight he went to bed,
      and slept till four; even when his servant called him, he fell asleep
      again while his clothes were being made ready.&nbsp; He rode to the
      scaffold in his own carriage, attended by two famous clergymen, <span
      class="smcap">Tillotson</span> and <span class="smcap">Burnet</span>, and
      sang a psalm to himself very softly, as he went along.&nbsp; He was as
      quiet and as steady as if he had been going out for an ordinary ride.&nbsp;
      After saying that he was surprised to see so great a crowd, he laid down
      his head upon the block, as if upon the pillow of his bed, and had it
      struck off at the second blow.&nbsp; His noble wife was busy for him even
      then; for that true-hearted lady printed and widely circulated his last
      words, of which he had given her a copy.&nbsp; They made the blood of all
      the honest men in England boil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The University of Oxford distinguished itself on the very same day by
      pretending to believe that the accusation against Lord Russell was true,
      and by calling the King, in a written paper, the Breath of their Nostrils
      and the Anointed of the Lord.&nbsp; This paper the Parliament afterwards
      caused to be burned by the common hangman; which I am sorry for, as I wish
      it had been framed and glazed and hung up in some public place, as a
      monument of baseness for the scorn of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, came the trial of Algernon Sidney, at which Jeffreys presided, like
      a great crimson toad, sweltering and swelling with rage.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
      pray God, Mr. Sidney,&rsquo; said this Chief Justice of a merry reign,
      after passing sentence, &lsquo;to work in you a temper fit to go to the
      other world, for I see you are not fit for this.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My
      lord,&rsquo; said the prisoner, composedly holding out his arm, &lsquo;feel
      my pulse, and see if I be disordered.&nbsp; I thank Heaven I never was in
      better temper than I am now.&rsquo;&nbsp; Algernon Sidney was executed on
      Tower Hill, on the seventh of December, one thousand six hundred and
      eighty-three.&nbsp; He died a hero, and died, in his own words, &lsquo;For
      that good old cause in which he had been engaged from his youth, and for
      which God had so often and so wonderfully declared himself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Monmouth had been making his uncle, the Duke of York, very
      jealous, by going about the country in a royal sort of way, playing at the
      people&rsquo;s games, becoming godfather to their children, and even
      touching for the King&rsquo;s evil, or stroking the faces of the sick to
      cure them&mdash;though, for the matter of that, I should say he did them
      about as much good as any crowned king could have done.&nbsp; His father
      had got him to write a letter, confessing his having had a part in the
      conspiracy, for which Lord Russell had been beheaded; but he was ever a
      weak man, and as soon as he had written it, he was ashamed of it and got
      it back again.&nbsp; For this, he was banished to the Netherlands; but he
      soon returned and had an interview with his father, unknown to his uncle.&nbsp;
      It would seem that he was coming into the Merry Monarch&rsquo;s favour
      again, and that the Duke of York was sliding out of it, when Death
      appeared to the merry galleries at Whitehall, and astonished the debauched
      lords and gentlemen, and the shameless ladies, very considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, the second of February, one thousand six hundred and
      eighty-five, the merry pensioner and servant of the King of France fell
      down in a fit of apoplexy.&nbsp; By the Wednesday his case was hopeless,
      and on the Thursday he was told so.&nbsp; As he made a difficulty about
      taking the sacrament from the Protestant Bishop of Bath, the Duke of York
      got all who were present away from the bed, and asked his brother, in a
      whisper, if he should send for a Catholic priest?&nbsp;&nbsp; The King
      replied, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, brother, do!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Duke
      smuggled in, up the back stairs, disguised in a wig and gown, a priest
      named <span class="smcap">Huddleston</span>, who had saved the King&rsquo;s
      life after the battle of Worcester: telling him that this worthy man in
      the wig had once saved his body, and was now come to save his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Merry Monarch lived through that night, and died before noon on the
      next day, which was Friday, the sixth.&nbsp; Two of the last things he
      said were of a human sort, and your remembrance will give him the full
      benefit of them.&nbsp; When the Queen sent to say she was too unwell to
      attend him and to ask his pardon, he said, &lsquo;Alas! poor woman, <i>she</i>
      beg <i>my</i> pardon!&nbsp; I beg hers with all my heart.&nbsp; Take back
      that answer to her.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he also said, in reference to Nell
      Gwyn, &lsquo;Do not let poor Nelly starve.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He died in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his
      reign.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE SECOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      King James the Second was a man so very disagreeable, that even the best
      of historians has favoured his brother Charles, as becoming, by
      comparison, quite a pleasant character.&nbsp; The one object of his short
      reign was to re-establish the Catholic religion in England; and this he
      doggedly pursued with such a stupid obstinacy, that his career very soon
      came to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing he did, was, to assure his council that he would make it
      his endeavour to preserve the Government, both in Church and State, as it
      was by law established; and that he would always take care to defend and
      support the Church.&nbsp; Great public acclamations were raised over this
      fair speech, and a great deal was said, from the pulpits and elsewhere,
      about the word of a King which was never broken, by credulous people who
      little supposed that he had formed a secret council for Catholic affairs,
      of which a mischievous Jesuit, called <span class="smcap">Father Petre</span>,
      was one of the chief members.&nbsp; With tears of joy in his eyes, he
      received, as the beginning of <i>his</i> pension from the King of France,
      five hundred thousand livres; yet, with a mixture of meanness and
      arrogance that belonged to his contemptible character, he was always
      jealous of making some show of being independent of the King of France,
      while he pocketed his money.&nbsp; As&mdash;notwithstanding his publishing
      two papers in favour of Popery (and not likely to do it much service, I
      should think) written by the King, his brother, and found in his
      strong-box; and his open display of himself attending mass&mdash;the
      Parliament was very obsequious, and granted him a large sum of money, he
      began his reign with a belief that he could do what he pleased, and with a
      determination to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we proceed to its principal events, let us dispose of Titus Oates.&nbsp;
      He was tried for perjury, a fortnight after the coronation, and besides
      being very heavily fined, was sentenced to stand twice in the pillory, to
      be whipped from Aldgate to Newgate one day, and from Newgate to Tyburn two
      days afterwards, and to stand in the pillory five times a year as long as
      he lived.&nbsp; This fearful sentence was actually inflicted on the
      rascal.&nbsp; Being unable to stand after his first flogging, he was
      dragged on a sledge from Newgate to Tyburn, and flogged as he was drawn
      along.&nbsp; He was so strong a villain that he did not die under the
      torture, but lived to be afterwards pardoned and rewarded, though not to
      be ever believed in any more.&nbsp; Dangerfield, the only other one of
      that crew left alive, was not so fortunate.&nbsp; He was almost killed by
      a whipping from Newgate to Tyburn, and, as if that were not punishment
      enough, a ferocious barrister of Gray&rsquo;s Inn gave him a poke in the
      eye with his cane, which caused his death; for which the ferocious
      barrister was deservedly tried and executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as James was on the throne, Argyle and Monmouth went from Brussels
      to Rotterdam, and attended a meeting of Scottish exiles held there, to
      concert measures for a rising in England.&nbsp; It was agreed that Argyle
      should effect a landing in Scotland, and Monmouth in England; and that two
      Englishmen should be sent with Argyle to be in his confidence, and two
      Scotchmen with the Duke of Monmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argyle was the first to act upon this contract.&nbsp; But, two of his men
      being taken prisoners at the Orkney Islands, the Government became aware
      of his intention, and was able to act against him with such vigour as to
      prevent his raising more than two or three thousand Highlanders, although
      he sent a fiery cross, by trusty messengers, from clan to clan and from
      glen to glen, as the custom then was when those wild people were to be
      excited by their chiefs.&nbsp; As he was moving towards Glasgow with his
      small force, he was betrayed by some of his followers, taken, and carried,
      with his hands tied behind his back, to his old prison in Edinburgh
      Castle.&nbsp; James ordered him to be executed, on his old shamefully
      unjust sentence, within three days; and he appears to have been anxious
      that his legs should have been pounded with his old favourite the boot.&nbsp;
      However, the boot was not applied; he was simply beheaded, and his head
      was set upon the top of Edinburgh Jail.&nbsp; One of those Englishmen who
      had been assigned to him was that old soldier Rumbold, the master of the
      Rye House.&nbsp; He was sorely wounded, and within a week after Argyle had
      suffered with great courage, was brought up for trial, lest he should die
      and disappoint the King.&nbsp; He, too, was executed, after defending
      himself with great spirit, and saying that he did not believe that God had
      made the greater part of mankind to carry saddles on their backs and
      bridles in their mouths, and to be ridden by a few, booted and spurred for
      the purpose&mdash;in which I thoroughly agree with Rumbold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Monmouth, partly through being detained and partly through
      idling his time away, was five or six weeks behind his friend when he
      landed at Lyme, in Dorset: having at his right hand an unlucky nobleman
      called <span class="smcap">Lord Grey of Werk</span>, who of himself would
      have ruined a far more promising expedition.&nbsp; He immediately set up
      his standard in the market-place, and proclaimed the King a tyrant, and a
      Popish usurper, and I know not what else; charging him, not only with what
      he had done, which was bad enough, but with what neither he nor anybody
      else had done, such as setting fire to London, and poisoning the late
      King.&nbsp; Raising some four thousand men by these means, he marched on
      to Taunton, where there were many Protestant dissenters who were strongly
      opposed to the Catholics.&nbsp; Here, both the rich and poor turned out to
      receive him, ladies waved a welcome to him from all the windows as he
      passed along the streets, flowers were strewn in his way, and every
      compliment and honour that could be devised was showered upon him.&nbsp;
      Among the rest, twenty young ladies came forward, in their best clothes,
      and in their brightest beauty, and gave him a Bible ornamented with their
      own fair hands, together with other presents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by this homage, he proclaimed himself King, and went on to
      Bridgewater.&nbsp; But, here the Government troops, under the <span
      class="smcap">Earl of Feversham</span>, were close at hand; and he was so
      dispirited at finding that he made but few powerful friends after all,
      that it was a question whether he should disband his army and endeavour to
      escape.&nbsp; It was resolved, at the instance of that unlucky Lord Grey,
      to make a night attack on the King&rsquo;s army, as it lay encamped on the
      edge of a morass called Sedgemoor.&nbsp; The horsemen were commanded by
      the same unlucky lord, who was not a brave man.&nbsp; He gave up the
      battle almost at the first obstacle&mdash;which was a deep drain; and
      although the poor countrymen, who had turned out for Monmouth, fought
      bravely with scythes, poles, pitchforks, and such poor weapons as they
      had, they were soon dispersed by the trained soldiers, and fled in all
      directions.&nbsp; When the Duke of Monmouth himself fled, was not known in
      the confusion; but the unlucky Lord Grey was taken early next day, and
      then another of the party was taken, who confessed that he had parted from
      the Duke only four hours before.&nbsp; Strict search being made, he was
      found disguised as a peasant, hidden in a ditch under fern and nettles,
      with a few peas in his pocket which he had gathered in the fields to eat.&nbsp;
      The only other articles he had upon him were a few papers and little
      books: one of the latter being a strange jumble, in his own writing, of
      charms, songs, recipes, and prayers.&nbsp; He was completely broken.&nbsp;
      He wrote a miserable letter to the King, beseeching and entreating to be
      allowed to see him.&nbsp; When he was taken to London, and conveyed bound
      into the King&rsquo;s presence, he crawled to him on his knees, and made a
      most degrading exhibition.&nbsp; As James never forgave or relented
      towards anybody, he was not likely to soften towards the issuer of the
      Lyme proclamation, so he told the suppliant to prepare for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifteenth of July, one thousand six hundred and eighty-five, this
      unfortunate favourite of the people was brought out to die on Tower Hill.&nbsp;
      The crowd was immense, and the tops of all the houses were covered with
      gazers.&nbsp; He had seen his wife, the daughter of the Duke of Buccleuch,
      in the Tower, and had talked much of a lady whom he loved far better&mdash;the
      <span class="smcap">Lady Harriet Wentworth</span>&mdash;who was one of the
      last persons he remembered in this life.&nbsp; Before laying down his head
      upon the block he felt the edge of the axe, and told the executioner that
      he feared it was not sharp enough, and that the axe was not heavy enough.&nbsp;
      On the executioner replying that it was of the proper kind, the Duke said,
      &lsquo;I pray you have a care, and do not use me so awkwardly as you used
      my Lord Russell.&rsquo;&nbsp; The executioner, made nervous by this, and
      trembling, struck once and merely gashed him in the neck.&nbsp; Upon this,
      the Duke of Monmouth raised his head and looked the man reproachfully in
      the face.&nbsp; Then he struck twice, and then thrice, and then threw down
      the axe, and cried out in a voice of horror that he could not finish that
      work.&nbsp; The sheriffs, however, threatening him with what should be
      done to himself if he did not, he took it up again and struck a fourth
      time and a fifth time.&nbsp; Then the wretched head at last fell off, and
      James, Duke of Monmouth, was dead, in the thirty-sixth year of his age.&nbsp;
      He was a showy, graceful man, with many popular qualities, and had found
      much favour in the open hearts of the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atrocities, committed by the Government, which followed this Monmouth
      rebellion, form the blackest and most lamentable page in English history.&nbsp;
      The poor peasants, having been dispersed with great loss, and their
      leaders having been taken, one would think that the implacable King might
      have been satisfied.&nbsp; But no; he let loose upon them, among other
      intolerable monsters, a <span class="smcap">Colonel Kirk</span>, who had
      served against the Moors, and whose soldiers&mdash;called by the people
      Kirk&rsquo;s lambs, because they bore a lamb upon their flag, as the
      emblem of Christianity&mdash;were worthy of their leader.&nbsp; The
      atrocities committed by these demons in human shape are far too horrible
      to be related here.&nbsp; It is enough to say, that besides most
      ruthlessly murdering and robbing them, and ruining them by making them buy
      their pardons at the price of all they possessed, it was one of Kirk&rsquo;s
      favourite amusements, as he and his officers sat drinking after dinner,
      and toasting the King, to have batches of prisoners hanged outside the
      windows for the company&rsquo;s diversion; and that when their feet
      quivered in the convulsions of death, he used to swear that they should
      have music to their dancing, and would order the drums to beat and the
      trumpets to play.&nbsp; The detestable King informed him, as an
      acknowledgment of these services, that he was &lsquo;very well satisfied
      with his proceedings.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the King&rsquo;s great delight was
      in the proceedings of Jeffreys, now a peer, who went down into the west,
      with four other judges, to try persons accused of having had any share in
      the rebellion.&nbsp; The King pleasantly called this &lsquo;Jeffreys&rsquo;s
      campaign.&rsquo;&nbsp; The people down in that part of the country
      remember it to this day as The Bloody Assize.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began at Winchester, where a poor deaf old lady, <span class="smcap">Mrs.
      Alicia Lisle</span>, the widow of one of the judges of Charles the First
      (who had been murdered abroad by some Royalist assassins), was charged
      with having given shelter in her house to two fugitives from Sedgemoor.&nbsp;
      Three times the jury refused to find her guilty, until Jeffreys bullied
      and frightened them into that false verdict.&nbsp; When he had extorted it
      from them, he said, &lsquo;Gentlemen, if I had been one of you, and she
      had been my own mother, I would have found her guilty;&rsquo;&mdash;as I
      dare say he would.&nbsp; He sentenced her to be burned alive, that very
      afternoon.&nbsp; The clergy of the cathedral and some others interfered in
      her favour, and she was beheaded within a week.&nbsp; As a high mark of
      his approbation, the King made Jeffreys Lord Chancellor; and he then went
      on to Dorchester, to Exeter, to Taunton, and to Wells.&nbsp; It is
      astonishing, when we read of the enormous injustice and barbarity of this
      beast, to know that no one struck him dead on the judgment-seat.&nbsp; It
      was enough for any man or woman to be accused by an enemy, before
      Jeffreys, to be found guilty of high treason.&nbsp; One man who pleaded
      not guilty, he ordered to be taken out of court upon the instant, and
      hanged; and this so terrified the prisoners in general that they mostly
      pleaded guilty at once.&nbsp; At Dorchester alone, in the course of a few
      days, Jeffreys hanged eighty people; besides whipping, transporting,
      imprisoning, and selling as slaves, great numbers.&nbsp; He executed, in
      all, two hundred and fifty, or three hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      These executions took place, among the neighbours and friends of the
      sentenced, in thirty-six towns and villages.&nbsp; Their bodies were
      mangled, steeped in caldrons of boiling pitch and tar, and hung up by the
      roadsides, in the streets, over the very churches.&nbsp; The sight and
      smell of heads and limbs, the hissing and bubbling of the infernal
      caldrons, and the tears and terrors of the people, were dreadful beyond
      all description.&nbsp; One rustic, who was forced to steep the remains in
      the black pot, was ever afterwards called &lsquo;Tom Boilman.&rsquo;&nbsp;
      The hangman has ever since been called Jack Ketch, because a man of that
      name went hanging and hanging, all day long, in the train of Jeffreys.&nbsp;
      You will hear much of the horrors of the great French Revolution.&nbsp;
      Many and terrible they were, there is no doubt; but I know of nothing
      worse, done by the maddened people of France in that awful time, than was
      done by the highest judge in England, with the express approval of the
      King of England, in The Bloody Assize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was even this all.&nbsp; Jeffreys was as fond of money for himself as
      of misery for others, and he sold pardons wholesale to fill his pockets.&nbsp;
      The King ordered, at one time, a thousand prisoners to be given to certain
      of his favourites, in order that they might bargain with them for their
      pardons.&nbsp; The young ladies of Taunton who had presented the Bible,
      were bestowed upon the maids of honour at court; and those precious ladies
      made very hard bargains with them indeed.&nbsp; When The Bloody Assize was
      at its most dismal height, the King was diverting himself with horse-races
      in the very place where Mrs. Lisle had been executed.&nbsp; When Jeffreys
      had done his worst, and came home again, he was particularly complimented
      in the Royal Gazette; and when the King heard that through drunkenness and
      raging he was very ill, his odious Majesty remarked that such another man
      could not easily be found in England.&nbsp; Besides all this, a former
      sheriff of London, named <span class="smcap">Cornish</span>, was hanged
      within sight of his own house, after an abominably conducted trial, for
      having had a share in the Rye House Plot, on evidence given by Rumsey,
      which that villain was obliged to confess was directly opposed to the
      evidence he had given on the trial of Lord Russell.&nbsp; And on the very
      same day, a worthy widow, named <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Gaunt</span>,
      was burned alive at Tyburn, for having sheltered a wretch who himself gave
      evidence against her.&nbsp; She settled the fuel about herself with her
      own hands, so that the flames should reach her quickly: and nobly said,
      with her last breath, that she had obeyed the sacred command of God, to
      give refuge to the outcast, and not to betray the wanderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all this hanging, beheading, burning, boiling, mutilating, exposing,
      robbing, transporting, and selling into slavery, of his unhappy subjects,
      the King not unnaturally thought that he could do whatever he would.&nbsp;
      So, he went to work to change the religion of the country with all
      possible speed; and what he did was this.
    </p>
    <p>
      He first of all tried to get rid of what was called the Test Act&mdash;which
      prevented the Catholics from holding public employments&mdash;by his own
      power of dispensing with the penalties.&nbsp; He tried it in one case,
      and, eleven of the twelve judges deciding in his favour, he exercised it
      in three others, being those of three dignitaries of University College,
      Oxford, who had become Papists, and whom he kept in their places and
      sanctioned.&nbsp; He revived the hated Ecclesiastical Commission, to get
      rid of <span class="smcap">Compton</span>, Bishop of London, who manfully
      opposed him.&nbsp; He solicited the Pope to favour England with an
      ambassador, which the Pope (who was a sensible man then) rather
      unwillingly did.&nbsp; He flourished Father Petre before the eyes of the
      people on all possible occasions.&nbsp; He favoured the establishment of
      convents in several parts of London.&nbsp; He was delighted to have the
      streets, and even the court itself, filled with Monks and Friars in the
      habits of their orders.&nbsp; He constantly endeavoured to make Catholics
      of the Protestants about him.&nbsp; He held private interviews, which he
      called &lsquo;closetings,&rsquo; with those Members of Parliament who held
      offices, to persuade them to consent to the design he had in view.&nbsp;
      When they did not consent, they were removed, or resigned of themselves,
      and their places were given to Catholics.&nbsp; He displaced Protestant
      officers from the army, by every means in his power, and got Catholics
      into their places too.&nbsp; He tried the same thing with the
      corporations, and also (though not so successfully) with the Lord
      Lieutenants of counties.&nbsp; To terrify the people into the endurance of
      all these measures, he kept an army of fifteen thousand men encamped on
      Hounslow Heath, where mass was openly performed in the General&rsquo;s
      tent, and where priests went among the soldiers endeavouring to persuade
      them to become Catholics.&nbsp; For circulating a paper among those men
      advising them to be true to their religion, a Protestant clergyman, named
      <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, the chaplain of the late Lord Russell,
      was actually sentenced to stand three times in the pillory, and was
      actually whipped from Newgate to Tyburn.&nbsp; He dismissed his own
      brother-in-law from his Council because he was a Protestant, and made a
      Privy Councillor of the before-mentioned Father Petre.&nbsp; He handed
      Ireland over to <span class="smcap">Richard Talbot</span>, <span
      class="smcap">Earl of Tyrconnell</span>, a worthless, dissolute knave, who
      played the same game there for his master, and who played the deeper game
      for himself of one day putting it under the protection of the French King.&nbsp;
      In going to these extremities, every man of sense and judgment among the
      Catholics, from the Pope to a porter, knew that the King was a mere
      bigoted fool, who would undo himself and the cause he sought to advance;
      but he was deaf to all reason, and, happily for England ever afterwards,
      went tumbling off his throne in his own blind way.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spirit began to arise in the country, which the besotted blunderer
      little expected.&nbsp; He first found it out in the University of
      Cambridge.&nbsp; Having made a Catholic a dean at Oxford without any
      opposition, he tried to make a monk a master of arts at Cambridge: which
      attempt the University resisted, and defeated him.&nbsp; He then went back
      to his favourite Oxford.&nbsp; On the death of the President of Magdalen
      College, he commanded that there should be elected to succeed him, one
      <span class="smcap">Mr. Anthony Farmer</span>, whose only recommendation
      was, that he was of the King&rsquo;s religion.&nbsp; The University
      plucked up courage at last, and refused.&nbsp; The King substituted
      another man, and it still refused, resolving to stand by its own election
      of a <span class="smcap">Mr. Hough</span>.&nbsp; The dull tyrant, upon
      this, punished Mr. Hough, and five-and-twenty more, by causing them to be
      expelled and declared incapable of holding any church preferment; then he
      proceeded to what he supposed to be his highest step, but to what was, in
      fact, his last plunge head-foremost in his tumble off his throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had issued a declaration that there should be no religious tests or
      penal laws, in order to let in the Catholics more easily; but the
      Protestant dissenters, unmindful of themselves, had gallantly joined the
      regular church in opposing it tooth and nail.&nbsp; The King and Father
      Petre now resolved to have this read, on a certain Sunday, in all the
      churches, and to order it to be circulated for that purpose by the
      bishops.&nbsp; The latter took counsel with the Archbishop of Canterbury,
      who was in disgrace; and they resolved that the declaration should not be
      read, and that they would petition the King against it.&nbsp; The
      Archbishop himself wrote out the petition, and six bishops went into the
      King&rsquo;s bedchamber the same night to present it, to his infinite
      astonishment.&nbsp; Next day was the Sunday fixed for the reading, and it
      was only read by two hundred clergymen out of ten thousand.&nbsp; The King
      resolved against all advice to prosecute the bishops in the Court of King&rsquo;s
      Bench, and within three weeks they were summoned before the Privy Council,
      and committed to the Tower.&nbsp; As the six bishops were taken to that
      dismal place, by water, the people who were assembled in immense numbers
      fell upon their knees, and wept for them, and prayed for them.&nbsp; When
      they got to the Tower, the officers and soldiers on guard besought them
      for their blessing.&nbsp; While they were confined there, the soldiers
      every day drank to their release with loud shouts.&nbsp; When they were
      brought up to the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench for their trial, which the
      Attorney-General said was for the high offence of censuring the
      Government, and giving their opinion about affairs of state, they were
      attended by similar multitudes, and surrounded by a throng of noblemen and
      gentlemen.&nbsp; When the jury went out at seven o&rsquo;clock at night to
      consider of their verdict, everybody (except the King) knew that they
      would rather starve than yield to the King&rsquo;s brewer, who was one of
      them, and wanted a verdict for his customer.&nbsp; When they came into
      court next morning, after resisting the brewer all night, and gave a
      verdict of not guilty, such a shout rose up in Westminster Hall as it had
      never heard before; and it was passed on among the people away to Temple
      Bar, and away again to the Tower.&nbsp; It did not pass only to the east,
      but passed to the west too, until it reached the camp at Hounslow, where
      the fifteen thousand soldiers took it up and echoed it.&nbsp; And still,
      when the dull King, who was then with Lord Feversham, heard the mighty
      roar, asked in alarm what it was, and was told that it was &lsquo;nothing
      but the acquittal of the bishops,&rsquo; he said, in his dogged way,
      &lsquo;Call you that nothing?&nbsp; It is so much the worse for them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the petition and the trial, the Queen had given birth to a son,
      which Father Petre rather thought was owing to Saint Winifred.&nbsp; But I
      doubt if Saint Winifred had much to do with it as the King&rsquo;s friend,
      inasmuch as the entirely new prospect of a Catholic successor (for both
      the King&rsquo;s daughters were Protestants) determined the <span
      class="smcap">Earls of Shrewsbury</span>, <span class="smcap">Danby</span>,
      and <span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord Lumley</span>,
      the <span class="smcap">Bishop of London</span>, <span class="smcap">Admiral
      Russell</span>, and <span class="smcap">Colonel Sidney</span>, to invite
      the Prince of Orange over to England.&nbsp; The Royal Mole, seeing his
      danger at last, made, in his fright, many great concessions, besides
      raising an army of forty thousand men; but the Prince of Orange was not a
      man for James the Second to cope with.&nbsp; His preparations were
      extraordinarily vigorous, and his mind was resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a fortnight after the Prince was ready to sail for England, a great
      wind from the west prevented the departure of his fleet.&nbsp; Even when
      the wind lulled, and it did sail, it was dispersed by a storm, and was
      obliged to put back to refit.&nbsp; At last, on the first of November, one
      thousand six hundred and eighty-eight, the Protestant east wind, as it was
      long called, began to blow; and on the third, the people of Dover and the
      people of Calais saw a fleet twenty miles long sailing gallantly by,
      between the two places.&nbsp; On Monday, the fifth, it anchored at Torbay
      in Devonshire, and the Prince, with a splendid retinue of officers and
      men, marched into Exeter.&nbsp; But the people in that western part of the
      country had suffered so much in The Bloody Assize, that they had lost
      heart.&nbsp; Few people joined him; and he began to think of returning,
      and publishing the invitation he had received from those lords, as his
      justification for having come at all.&nbsp; At this crisis, some of the
      gentry joined him; the Royal army began to falter; an engagement was
      signed, by which all who set their hand to it declared that they would
      support one another in defence of the laws and liberties of the three
      Kingdoms, of the Protestant religion, and of the Prince of Orange.&nbsp;
      From that time, the cause received no check; the greatest towns in England
      began, one after another, to declare for the Prince; and he knew that it
      was all safe with him when the University of Oxford offered to melt down
      its plate, if he wanted any money.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the King was running about in a pitiable way, touching people
      for the King&rsquo;s evil in one place, reviewing his troops in another,
      and bleeding from the nose in a third.&nbsp; The young Prince was sent to
      Portsmouth, Father Petre went off like a shot to France, and there was a
      general and swift dispersal of all the priests and friars.&nbsp; One after
      another, the King&rsquo;s most important officers and friends deserted him
      and went over to the Prince.&nbsp; In the night, his daughter Anne fled
      from Whitehall Palace; and the Bishop of London, who had once been a
      soldier, rode before her with a drawn sword in his hand, and pistols at
      his saddle.&nbsp; &lsquo;God help me,&rsquo; cried the miserable King:
      &lsquo;my very children have forsaken me!&rsquo;&nbsp; In his wildness,
      after debating with such lords as were in London, whether he should or
      should not call a Parliament, and after naming three of them to negotiate
      with the Prince, he resolved to fly to France.&nbsp; He had the little
      Prince of Wales brought back from Portsmouth; and the child and the Queen
      crossed the river to Lambeth in an open boat, on a miserable wet night,
      and got safely away.&nbsp; This was on the night of the ninth of December.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the eleventh, the King, who had, in
      the meantime, received a letter from the Prince of Orange, stating his
      objects, got out of bed, told <span class="smcap">Lord Northumberland</span>
      who lay in his room not to open the door until the usual hour in the
      morning, and went down the back stairs (the same, I suppose, by which the
      priest in the wig and gown had come up to his brother) and crossed the
      river in a small boat: sinking the great seal of England by the way.&nbsp;
      Horses having been provided, he rode, accompanied by <span class="smcap">Sir
      Edward Hales</span>, to Feversham, where he embarked in a Custom House
      Hoy.&nbsp; The master of this Hoy, wanting more ballast, ran into the Isle
      of Sheppy to get it, where the fishermen and smugglers crowded about the
      boat, and informed the King of their suspicions that he was a &lsquo;hatchet-faced
      Jesuit.&rsquo;&nbsp; As they took his money and would not let him go, he
      told them who he was, and that the Prince of Orange wanted to take his
      life; and he began to scream for a boat&mdash;and then to cry, because he
      had lost a piece of wood on his ride which he called a fragment of Our
      Saviour&rsquo;s cross.&nbsp; He put himself into the hands of the Lord
      Lieutenant of the county, and his detention was made known to the Prince
      of Orange at Windsor&mdash;who, only wanting to get rid of him, and not
      caring where he went, so that he went away, was very much disconcerted
      that they did not let him go.&nbsp; However, there was nothing for it but
      to have him brought back, with some state in the way of Life Guards, to
      Whitehall.&nbsp; And as soon as he got there, in his infatuation, he heard
      mass, and set a Jesuit to say grace at his public dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people had been thrown into the strangest state of confusion by his
      flight, and had taken it into their heads that the Irish part of the army
      were going to murder the Protestants.&nbsp; Therefore, they set the bells
      a ringing, and lighted watch-fires, and burned Catholic Chapels, and
      looked about in all directions for Father Petre and the Jesuits, while the
      Pope&rsquo;s ambassador was running away in the dress of a footman.&nbsp;
      They found no Jesuits; but a man, who had once been a frightened witness
      before Jeffreys in court, saw a swollen, drunken face looking through a
      window down at Wapping, which he well remembered.&nbsp; The face was in a
      sailor&rsquo;s dress, but he knew it to be the face of that accursed
      judge, and he seized him.&nbsp; The people, to their lasting honour, did
      not tear him to pieces.&nbsp; After knocking him about a little, they took
      him, in the basest agonies of terror, to the Lord Mayor, who sent him, at
      his own shrieking petition, to the Tower for safety.&nbsp; There, he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their bewilderment continuing, the people now lighted bonfires and made
      rejoicings, as if they had any reason to be glad to have the King back
      again.&nbsp; But, his stay was very short, for the English guards were
      removed from Whitehall, Dutch guards were marched up to it, and he was
      told by one of his late ministers that the Prince would enter London, next
      day, and he had better go to Ham.&nbsp; He said, Ham was a cold, damp
      place, and he would rather go to Rochester.&nbsp; He thought himself very
      cunning in this, as he meant to escape from Rochester to France.&nbsp; The
      Prince of Orange and his friends knew that, perfectly well, and desired
      nothing more.&nbsp; So, he went to Gravesend, in his royal barge, attended
      by certain lords, and watched by Dutch troops, and pitied by the generous
      people, who were far more forgiving than he had ever been, when they saw
      him in his humiliation.&nbsp; On the night of the twenty-third of
      December, not even then understanding that everybody wanted to get rid of
      him, he went out, absurdly, through his Rochester garden, down to the
      Medway, and got away to France, where he rejoined the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a council in his absence, of the lords, and the authorities
      of London.&nbsp; When the Prince came, on the day after the King&rsquo;s
      departure, he summoned the Lords to meet him, and soon afterwards, all
      those who had served in any of the Parliaments of King Charles the Second.&nbsp;
      It was finally resolved by these authorities that the throne was vacant by
      the conduct of King James the Second; that it was inconsistent with the
      safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom, to be governed by a Popish
      prince; that the Prince and Princess of Orange should be King and Queen
      during their lives and the life of the survivor of them; and that their
      children should succeed them, if they had any.&nbsp; That if they had
      none, the Princess Anne and her children should succeed; that if she had
      none, the heirs of the Prince of Orange should succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the thirteenth of January, one thousand six hundred and eighty-nine,
      the Prince and Princess, sitting on a throne in Whitehall, bound
      themselves to these conditions.&nbsp; The Protestant religion was
      established in England, and England&rsquo;s great and glorious Revolution
      was complete.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have now arrived at the close of my little history.&nbsp; The events
      which succeeded the famous Revolution of one thousand six hundred and
      eighty-eight, would neither be easily related nor easily understood in
      such a book as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      William and Mary reigned together, five years.&nbsp; After the death of
      his good wife, William occupied the throne, alone, for seven years longer.&nbsp;
      During his reign, on the sixteenth of September, one thousand seven
      hundred and one, the poor weak creature who had once been James the Second
      of England, died in France.&nbsp; In the meantime he had done his utmost
      (which was not much) to cause William to be assassinated, and to regain
      his lost dominions.&nbsp; James&rsquo;s son was declared, by the French
      King, the rightful King of England; and was called in France <span
      class="smcap">The Chevalier Saint George</span>, and in England <span
      class="smcap">The Pretender</span>.&nbsp; Some infatuated people in
      England, and particularly in Scotland, took up the Pretender&rsquo;s cause
      from time to time&mdash;as if the country had not had Stuarts enough!&mdash;and
      many lives were sacrificed, and much misery was occasioned.&nbsp; King
      William died on Sunday, the seventh of March, one thousand seven hundred
      and two, of the consequences of an accident occasioned by his horse
      stumbling with him.&nbsp; He was always a brave, patriotic Prince, and a
      man of remarkable abilities.&nbsp; His manner was cold, and he made but
      few friends; but he had truly loved his queen.&nbsp; When he was dead, a
      lock of her hair, in a ring, was found tied with a black ribbon round his
      left arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was succeeded by the <span class="smcap">Princess Anne</span>, a
      popular Queen, who reigned twelve years.&nbsp; In her reign, in the month
      of May, one thousand seven hundred and seven, the Union between England
      and Scotland was effected, and the two countries were incorporated under
      the name of <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>.&nbsp; Then, from the
      year one thousand seven hundred and fourteen to the year one thousand,
      eight hundred and thirty, reigned the four <span class="smcap">Georges</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the reign of George the Second, one thousand seven hundred and
      forty-five, that the Pretender did his last mischief, and made his last
      appearance.&nbsp; Being an old man by that time, he and the Jacobites&mdash;as
      his friends were called&mdash;put forward his son, <span class="smcap">Charles
      Edward</span>, known as the young Chevalier.&nbsp; The Highlanders of
      Scotland, an extremely troublesome and wrong-headed race on the subject of
      the Stuarts, espoused his cause, and he joined them, and there was a
      Scottish rebellion to make him king, in which many gallant and devoted
      gentlemen lost their lives.&nbsp; It was a hard matter for Charles Edward
      to escape abroad again, with a high price on his head; but the Scottish
      people were extraordinarily faithful to him, and, after undergoing many
      romantic adventures, not unlike those of Charles the Second, he escaped to
      France.&nbsp; A number of charming stories and delightful songs arose out
      of the Jacobite feelings, and belong to the Jacobite times.&nbsp;
      Otherwise I think the Stuarts were a public nuisance altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the reign of George the Third that England lost North America,
      by persisting in taxing her without her own consent.&nbsp; That immense
      country, made independent under <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, and
      left to itself, became the United States; one of the greatest nations of
      the earth.&nbsp; In these times in which I write, it is honourably
      remarkable for protecting its subjects, wherever they may travel, with a
      dignity and a determination which is a model for England.&nbsp; Between
      you and me, England has rather lost ground in this respect since the days
      of Oliver Cromwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Union of Great Britain with Ireland&mdash;which had been getting on
      very ill by itself&mdash;took place in the reign of George the Third, on
      the second of July, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">William the Fourth</span> succeeded George the Fourth,
      in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty, and reigned seven
      years.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Queen Victoria</span>, his niece, the
      only child of the Duke of Kent, the fourth son of George the Third, came
      to the throne on the twentieth of June, one thousand eight hundred and
      thirty-seven.&nbsp; She was married to <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span>
      of Saxe Gotha on the tenth of February, one thousand eight hundred and
      forty.&nbsp; She is very good, and much beloved.&nbsp; So I end, like the
      crier, with

      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The whole of these Sketches were written and published, one by one, when I
      was a very young man. They were collected and republished while I was
      still a very young man; and sent into the world with all their
      imperfections (a good many) on their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      They comprise my first attempts at authorship-with the exception of
      certain tragedies achieved at the mature age of eight or ten, and
      represented with great applause to overflowing nurseries. I am conscious
      of their often being extremely crude and ill-considered, and bearing
      obvious marks of haste and inexperience; particularly in that section of
      the present volume which is comprised under the general head of Tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as this collection is not originated now, and was very leniently and
      favourably received when it was first made, I have not felt it right
      either to remodel or expunge, beyond a few words and phrases here and
      there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I-THE BEADLE. THE PARISH ENGINE. THE SCHOOLMASTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      How much is conveyed in those two short words-'The Parish!' And with how
      many tales of distress and misery, of broken fortune and ruined hopes, too
      often of unrelieved wretchedness and successful knavery, are they
      associated! A poor man, with small earnings, and a large family, just
      manages to live on from hand to mouth, and to procure food from day to
      day; he has barely sufficient to satisfy the present cravings of nature,
      and can take no heed of the future. His taxes are in arrear, quarter-day
      passes by, another quarter-day arrives: he can procure no more quarter for
      himself, and is summoned by-the parish. His goods are distrained, his
      children are crying with cold and hunger, and the very bed on which his
      sick wife is lying, is dragged from beneath her. What can he do? To whom
      is he to apply for relief? To private charity? To benevolent individuals?
      Certainly not-there is his parish. There are the parish vestry, the parish
      infirmary, the parish surgeon, the parish officers, the parish beadle.
      Excellent institutions, and gentle, kind- hearted men. The woman dies-she
      is buried by the parish. The children have no protector-they are taken
      care of by the parish. The man first neglects, and afterwards cannot
      obtain, work-he is relieved by the parish; and when distress and
      drunkenness have done their work upon him, he is maintained, a harmless
      babbling idiot, in the parish asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parish beadle is one of the most, perhaps the most, important member
      of the local administration. He is not so well off as the churchwardens,
      certainly, nor is he so learned as the vestry-clerk, nor does he order
      things quite so much his own way as either of them. But his power is very
      great, notwithstanding; and the dignity of his office is never impaired by
      the absence of efforts on his part to maintain it. The beadle of our
      parish is a splendid fellow. It is quite delightful to hear him, as he
      explains the state of the existing poor laws to the deaf old women in the
      board-room passage on business nights; and to hear what he said to the
      senior churchwarden, and what the senior churchwarden said to him; and
      what 'we' (the beadle and the other gentlemen) came to the determination
      of doing. A miserable-looking woman is called into the boardroom, and
      represents a case of extreme destitution, affecting herself-a widow, with
      six small children. 'Where do you live?' inquires one of the overseers. 'I
      rents a two-pair back, gentlemen, at Mrs. Brown's, Number 3, Little King
      William's-alley, which has lived there this fifteen year, and knows me to
      be very hard-working and industrious, and when my poor husband was alive,
      gentlemen, as died in the hospital'-'Well, well,' interrupts the overseer,
      taking a note of the address, 'I'll send Simmons, the beadle, to-morrow
      morning, to ascertain whether your story is correct; and if so, I suppose
      you must have an order into the House-Simmons, go to this woman's the
      first thing to-morrow morning, will you?' Simmons bows assent, and ushers
      the woman out. Her previous admiration of 'the board' (who all sit behind
      great books, and with their hats on) fades into nothing before her respect
      for her lace-trimmed conductor; and her account of what has passed inside,
      increases-if that be possible-the marks of respect, shown by the assembled
      crowd, to that solemn functionary. As to taking out a summons, it's quite
      a hopeless case if Simmons attends it, on behalf of the parish. He knows
      all the titles of the Lord Mayor by heart; states the case without a
      single stammer: and it is even reported that on one occasion he ventured
      to make a joke, which the Lord Mayor's head footman (who happened to be
      present) afterwards told an intimate friend, confidentially, was almost
      equal to one of Mr. Hobler's.
    </p>
    <p>
      See him again on Sunday in his state-coat and cocked-hat, with a large-
      headed staff for show in his left hand, and a small cane for use in his
      right. How pompously he marshals the children into their places! and how
      demurely the little urchins look at him askance as he surveys them when
      they are all seated, with a glare of the eye peculiar to beadles! The
      churchwardens and overseers being duly installed in their curtained pews,
      he seats himself on a mahogany bracket, erected expressly for him at the
      top of the aisle, and divides his attention between his prayer- book and
      the boys. Suddenly, just at the commencement of the communion service,
      when the whole congregation is hushed into a profound silence, broken only
      by the voice of the officiating clergyman, a penny is heard to ring on the
      stone floor of the aisle with astounding clearness. Observe the
      generalship of the beadle. His involuntary look of horror is instantly
      changed into one of perfect indifference, as if he were the only person
      present who had not heard the noise. The artifice succeeds. After putting
      forth his right leg now and then, as a feeler, the victim who dropped the
      money ventures to make one or two distinct dives after it; and the beadle,
      gliding softly round, salutes his little round head, when it again appears
      above the seat, with divers double knocks, administered with the cane
      before noticed, to the intense delight of three young men in an adjacent
      pew, who cough violently at intervals until the conclusion of the sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are a few traits of the importance and gravity of a parish beadle-a
      gravity which has never been disturbed in any case that has come under our
      observation, except when the services of that particularly useful machine,
      a parish fire-engine, are required: then indeed all is bustle. Two little
      boys run to the beadle as fast as their legs will carry them, and report
      from their own personal observation that some neighbouring chimney is on
      fire; the engine is hastily got out, and a plentiful supply of boys being
      obtained, and harnessed to it with ropes, away they rattle over the
      pavement, the beadle, running-we do not exaggerate-running at the side,
      until they arrive at some house, smelling strongly of soot, at the door of
      which the beadle knocks with considerable gravity for half-an-hour. No
      attention being paid to these manual applications, and the turn-cock
      having turned on the water, the engine turns off amidst the shouts of the
      boys; it pulls up once more at the work-house, and the beadle 'pulls up'
      the unfortunate householder next day, for the amount of his legal reward.
      We never saw a parish engine at a regular fire but once. It came up in
      gallant style-three miles and a half an hour, at least; there was a
      capital supply of water, and it was first on the spot. Bang went the
      pumps-the people cheered-the beadle perspired profusely; but it was
      unfortunately discovered, just as they were going to put the fire out,
      that nobody understood the process by which the engine was filled with
      water; and that eighteen boys, and a man, had exhausted themselves in
      pumping for twenty minutes, without producing the slightest effect!
    </p>
    <p>
      The personages next in importance to the beadle, are the master of the
      workhouse and the parish schoolmaster. The vestry-clerk, as everybody
      knows, is a short, pudgy little man, in black, with a thick gold watch-
      chain of considerable length, terminating in two large seals and a key. He
      is an attorney, and generally in a bustle; at no time more so, than when
      he is hurrying to some parochial meeting, with his gloves crumpled up in
      one hand, and a large red book under the other arm. As to the
      churchwardens and overseers, we exclude them altogether, because all we
      know of them is, that they are usually respectable tradesmen, who wear
      hats with brims inclined to flatness, and who occasionally testify in gilt
      letters on a blue ground, in some conspicuous part of the church, to the
      important fact of a gallery having being enlarged and beautified, or an
      organ rebuilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the workhouse is not, in our parish-nor is he usually in any
      other-one of that class of men the better part of whose existence has
      passed away, and who drag out the remainder in some inferior situation,
      with just enough thought of the past, to feel degraded by, and
      discontented with the present. We are unable to guess precisely to our own
      satisfaction what station the man can have occupied before; we should
      think he had been an inferior sort of attorney's clerk, or else the master
      of a national school-whatever he was, it is clear his present position is
      a change for the better. His income is small certainly, as the rusty black
      coat and threadbare velvet collar demonstrate: but then he lives free of
      house-rent, has a limited allowance of coals and candles, and an almost
      unlimited allowance of authority in his petty kingdom. He is a tall, thin,
      bony man; always wears shoes and black cotton stockings with his surtout;
      and eyes you, as you pass his parlour-window, as if he wished you were a
      pauper, just to give you a specimen of his power. He is an admirable
      specimen of a small tyrant: morose, brutish, and ill-tempered; bullying to
      his inferiors, cringing to his superiors, and jealous of the influence and
      authority of the beadle.

      Our schoolmaster is just the very reverse of this amiable official. He has
      been one of those men one occasionally hears of, on whom misfortune seems
      to have set her mark; nothing he ever did, or was concerned in, appears to
      have prospered. A rich old relation who had brought him up, and openly
      announced his intention of providing for him, left him 10,000l. in his
      will, and revoked the bequest in a codicil. Thus unexpectedly reduced to
      the necessity of providing for himself, he procured a situation in a
      public office. The young clerks below him, died off as if there were a
      plague among them; but the old fellows over his head, for the reversion of
      whose places he was anxiously waiting, lived on and on, as if they were
      immortal. He speculated and lost. He speculated again and won-but never
      got his money. His talents were great; his disposition, easy, generous and
      liberal. His friends profited by the one, and abused the other. Loss
      succeeded loss; misfortune crowded on misfortune; each successive day
      brought him nearer the verge of hopeless penury, and the quondam friends
      who had been warmest in their professions, grew strangely cold and
      indifferent. He had children whom he loved, and a wife on whom he doted.
      The former turned their backs on him; the latter died broken-hearted. He
      went with the stream-it had ever been his failing, and he had not courage
      sufficient to bear up against so many shocks-he had never cared for
      himself, and the only being who had cared for him, in his poverty and
      distress, was spared to him no longer. It was at this period that he
      applied for parochial relief. Some kind-hearted man who had known him in
      happier times, chanced to be churchwarden that year, and through his
      interest he was appointed to his present situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is an old man now. Of the many who once crowded round him in all the
      hollow friendship of boon-companionship, some have died, some have fallen
      like himself, some have prospered-all have forgotten him. Time and
      misfortune have mercifully been permitted to impair his memory, and use
      has habituated him to his present condition. Meek, uncomplaining, and
      zealous in the discharge of his duties, he has been allowed to hold his
      situation long beyond the usual period; and he will no doubt continue to
      hold it, until infirmity renders him incapable, or death releases him. As
      the grey-headed old man feebly paces up and down the sunny side of the
      little court-yard between school hours, it would be difficult, indeed, for
      the most intimate of his former friends to recognise their once gay and
      happy associate, in the person of the Pauper Schoolmaster.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II-THE CURATE. THE OLD LADY. THE HALF-PAY CAPTAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      We commenced our last chapter with the beadle of our parish, because we
      are deeply sensible of the importance and dignity of his office. We will
      begin the present, with the clergyman. Our curate is a young gentleman of
      such prepossessing appearance, and fascinating manners, that within one
      month after his first appearance in the parish, half the young-lady
      inhabitants were melancholy with religion, and the other half, desponding
      with love. Never were so many young ladies seen in our parish church on
      Sunday before; and never had the little round angels' faces on Mr.
      Tomkins's monument in the side aisle, beheld such devotion on earth as
      they all exhibited. He was about five-and-twenty when he first came to
      astonish the parishioners. He parted his hair on the centre of his
      forehead in the form of a Norman arch, wore a brilliant of the first water
      on the fourth finger of his left hand (which he always applied to his left
      cheek when he read prayers), and had a deep sepulchral voice of unusual
      solemnity. Innumerable were the calls made by prudent mammas on our new
      curate, and innumerable the invitations with which he was assailed, and
      which, to do him justice, he readily accepted. If his manner in the pulpit
      had created an impression in his favour, the sensation was increased
      tenfold, by his appearance in private circles. Pews in the immediate
      vicinity of the pulpit or reading-desk rose in value; sittings in the
      centre aisle were at a premium: an inch of room in the front row of the
      gallery could not be procured for love or money; and some people even went
      so far as to assert, that the three Miss Browns, who had an obscure family
      pew just behind the churchwardens', were detected, one Sunday, in the free
      seats by the communion-table, actually lying in wait for the curate as he
      passed to the vestry! He began to preach extempore sermons, and even grave
      papas caught the infection. He got out of bed at half-past twelve o'clock
      one winter's night, to half-baptise a washerwoman's child in a slop-basin,
      and the gratitude of the parishioners knew no bounds-the very
      churchwardens grew generous, and insisted on the parish defraying the
      expense of the watch-box on wheels, which the new curate had ordered for
      himself, to perform the funeral service in, in wet weather. He sent three
      pints of gruel and a quarter of a pound of tea to a poor woman who had
      been brought to bed of four small children, all at once-the parish were
      charmed. He got up a subscription for her-the woman's fortune was made. He
      spoke for one hour and twenty-five minutes, at an anti-slavery meeting at
      the Goat and Boots-the enthusiasm was at its height. A proposal was set on
      foot for presenting the curate with a piece of plate, as a mark of esteem
      for his valuable services rendered to the parish. The list of
      subscriptions was filled up in no time; the contest was, not who should
      escape the contribution, but who should be the foremost to subscribe. A
      splendid silver inkstand was made, and engraved with an appropriate
      inscription; the curate was invited to a public breakfast, at the
      before-mentioned Goat and Boots; the inkstand was presented in a neat
      speech by Mr. Gubbins, the ex-churchwarden, and acknowledged by the curate
      in terms which drew tears into the eyes of all present-the very waiters
      were melted.
    </p>
    <p>
      One would have supposed that, by this time, the theme of universal
      admiration was lifted to the very pinnacle of popularity. No such thing.
      The curate began to cough; four fits of coughing one morning between the
      Litany and the Epistle, and five in the afternoon service. Here was a
      discovery-the curate was consumptive. How interestingly melancholy! If the
      young ladies were energetic before, their sympathy and solicitude now knew
      no bounds. Such a man as the curate-such a dear-such a perfect love-to be
      consumptive! It was too much. Anonymous presents of black-currant jam, and
      lozenges, elastic waistcoats, bosom friends, and warm stockings, poured in
      upon the curate until he was as completely fitted out with winter
      clothing, as if he were on the verge of an expedition to the North Pole:
      verbal bulletins of the state of his health were circulated throughout the
      parish half-a-dozen times a day; and the curate was in the very zenith of
      his popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this period, a change came over the spirit of the parish. A very
      quiet, respectable, dozing old gentleman, who had officiated in our
      chapel-of-ease for twelve years previously, died one fine morning, without
      having given any notice whatever of his intention. This circumstance gave
      rise to counter-sensation the first; and the arrival of his successor
      occasioned counter-sensation the second. He was a pale, thin, cadaverous
      man, with large black eyes, and long straggling black hair: his dress was
      slovenly in the extreme, his manner ungainly, his doctrines startling; in
      short, he was in every respect the antipodes of the curate. Crowds of our
      female parishioners flocked to hear him; at first, because he was so
      odd-looking, then because his face was so expressive, then because he
      preached so well; and at last, because they really thought that, after
      all, there was something about him which it was quite impossible to
      describe. As to the curate, he was all very well; but certainly, after
      all, there was no denying that-that-in short, the curate wasn't a novelty,
      and the other clergyman was. The inconstancy of public opinion is
      proverbial: the congregation migrated one by one. The curate coughed till
      he was black in the face-it was in vain. He respired with difficulty-it
      was equally ineffectual in awakening sympathy. Seats are once again to be
      had in any part of our parish church, and the chapel-of-ease is going to
      be enlarged, as it is crowded to suffocation every Sunday!
    </p>
    <p>
      The best known and most respected among our parishioners, is an old lady,
      who resided in our parish long before our name was registered in the list
      of baptisms. Our parish is a suburban one, and the old lady lives in a
      neat row of houses in the most airy and pleasant part of it. The house is
      her own; and it, and everything about it, except the old lady herself, who
      looks a little older than she did ten years ago, is in just the same state
      as when the old gentleman was living. The little front parlour, which is
      the old lady's ordinary sitting-room, is a perfect picture of quiet
      neatness; the carpet is covered with brown Holland, the glass and
      picture-frames are carefully enveloped in yellow muslin; the table-covers
      are never taken off, except when the leaves are turpentined and
      bees'-waxed, an operation which is regularly commenced every other morning
      at half-past nine o'clock-and the little nicknacks are always arranged in
      precisely the same manner. The greater part of these are presents from
      little girls whose parents live in the same row; but some of them, such as
      the two old-fashioned watches (which never keep the same time, one being
      always a quarter of an hour too slow, and the other a quarter of an hour
      too fast), the little picture of the Princess Charlotte and Prince Leopold
      as they appeared in the Royal Box at Drury Lane Theatre, and others of the
      same class, have been in the old lady's possession for many years. Here
      the old lady sits with her spectacles on, busily engaged in
      needlework-near the window in summer time; and if she sees you coming up
      the steps, and you happen to be a favourite, she trots out to open the
      street-door for you before you knock, and as you must be fatigued after
      that hot walk, insists on your swallowing two glasses of sherry before you
      exert yourself by talking. If you call in the evening you will find her
      cheerful, but rather more serious than usual, with an open Bible on the
      table, before her, of which 'Sarah,' who is just as neat and methodical as
      her mistress, regularly reads two or three chapters in the parlour aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady sees scarcely any company, except the little girls before
      noticed, each of whom has always a regular fixed day for a periodical
      tea-drinking with her, to which the child looks forward as the greatest
      treat of its existence. She seldom visits at a greater distance than the
      next door but one on either side; and when she drinks tea here, Sarah runs
      out first and knocks a double-knock, to prevent the possibility of her
      'Missis's' catching cold by having to wait at the door. She is very
      scrupulous in returning these little invitations, and when she asks Mr.
      and Mrs. So-and-so, to meet Mr. and Mrs. Somebody- else, Sarah and she
      dust the urn, and the best china tea-service, and the Pope Joan board; and
      the visitors are received in the drawing-room in great state. She has but
      few relations, and they are scattered about in different parts of the
      country, and she seldom sees them. She has a son in India, whom she always
      describes to you as a fine, handsome fellow-so like the profile of his
      poor dear father over the sideboard, but the old lady adds, with a
      mournful shake of the head, that he has always been one of her greatest
      trials; and that indeed he once almost broke her heart; but it pleased God
      to enable her to get the better of it, and she would prefer your never
      mentioning the subject to her again. She has a great number of pensioners:
      and on Saturday, after she comes back from market, there is a regular
      levee of old men and women in the passage, waiting for their weekly
      gratuity. Her name always heads the list of any benevolent subscriptions,
      and hers are always the most liberal donations to the Winter Coal and Soup
      Distribution Society. She subscribed twenty pounds towards the erection of
      an organ in our parish church, and was so overcome the first Sunday the
      children sang to it, that she was obliged to be carried out by the
      pew-opener. Her entrance into church on Sunday is always the signal for a
      little bustle in the side aisle, occasioned by a general rise among the
      poor people, who bow and curtsey until the pew-opener has ushered the old
      lady into her accustomed seat, dropped a respectful curtsey, and shut the
      door: and the same ceremony is repeated on her leaving church, when she
      walks home with the family next door but one, and talks about the sermon
      all the way, invariably opening the conversation by asking the youngest
      boy where the text was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, with the annual variation of a trip to some quiet place on the
      sea-coast, passes the old lady's life. It has rolled on in the same
      unvarying and benevolent course for many years now, and must at no distant
      period be brought to its final close. She looks forward to its
      termination, with calmness and without apprehension. She has everything to
      hope and nothing to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very different personage, but one who has rendered himself very
      conspicuous in our parish, is one of the old lady's next-door neighbours.
      He is an old naval officer on half-pay, and his bluff and unceremonious
      behaviour disturbs the old lady's domestic economy, not a little. In the
      first place, he will smoke cigars in the front court, and when he wants
      something to drink with them-which is by no means an uncommon
      circumstance-he lifts up the old lady's knocker with his walking-stick,
      and demands to have a glass of table ale, handed over the rails. In
      addition to this cool proceeding, he is a bit of a Jack of all trades, or
      to use his own words, 'a regular Robinson Crusoe;' and nothing delights
      him better than to experimentalise on the old lady's property. One morning
      he got up early, and planted three or four roots of full-grown marigolds
      in every bed of her front garden, to the inconceivable astonishment of the
      old lady, who actually thought when she got up and looked out of the
      window, that it was some strange eruption which had come out in the night.
      Another time he took to pieces the eight-day clock on the front landing,
      under pretence of cleaning the works, which he put together again, by some
      undiscovered process, in so wonderful a manner, that the large hand has
      done nothing but trip up the little one ever since. Then he took to
      breeding silk- worms, which he would bring in two or three times a day, in
      little paper boxes, to show the old lady, generally dropping a worm or two
      at every visit. The consequence was, that one morning a very stout
      silk-worm was discovered in the act of walking up-stairs-probably with the
      view of inquiring after his friends, for, on further inspection, it
      appeared that some of his companions had already found their way to every
      room in the house. The old lady went to the seaside in despair, and during
      her absence he completely effaced the name from her brass door-plate, in
      his attempts to polish it with aqua-fortis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this is nothing to his seditious conduct in public life. He
      attends every vestry meeting that is held; always opposes the constituted
      authorities of the parish, denounces the profligacy of the churchwardens,
      contests legal points against the vestry-clerk, will make the tax-gatherer
      call for his money till he won't call any longer, and then he sends it:
      finds fault with the sermon every Sunday, says that the organist ought to
      be ashamed of himself, offers to back himself for any amount to sing the
      psalms better than all the children put together, male and female; and, in
      short, conducts himself in the most turbulent and uproarious manner. The
      worst of it is, that having a high regard for the old lady, he wants to
      make her a convert to his views, and therefore walks into her little
      parlour with his newspaper in his hand, and talks violent politics by the
      hour. He is a charitable, open- hearted old fellow at bottom, after all;
      so, although he puts the old lady a little out occasionally, they agree
      very well in the main, and she laughs as much at each feat of his
      handiwork when it is all over, as anybody else.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III-THE FOUR SISTERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The row of houses in which the old lady and her troublesome neighbour
      reside, comprises, beyond all doubt, a greater number of characters within
      its circumscribed limits, than all the rest of the parish put together. As
      we cannot, consistently with our present plan, however, extend the number
      of our parochial sketches beyond six, it will be better perhaps, to select
      the most peculiar, and to introduce them at once without further preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four Miss Willises, then, settled in our parish thirteen years ago. It
      is a melancholy reflection that the old adage, 'time and tide wait for no
      man,' applies with equal force to the fairer portion of the creation; and
      willingly would we conceal the fact, that even thirteen years ago the Miss
      Willises were far from juvenile. Our duty as faithful parochial
      chroniclers, however, is paramount to every other consideration, and we
      are bound to state, that thirteen years since, the authorities in
      matrimonial cases, considered the youngest Miss Willis in a very
      precarious state, while the eldest sister was positively given over, as
      being far beyond all human hope. Well, the Miss Willises took a lease of
      the house; it was fresh painted and papered from top to bottom: the paint
      inside was all wainscoted, the marble all cleaned, the old grates taken
      down, and register-stoves, you could see to dress by, put up; four trees
      were planted in the back garden, several small baskets of gravel sprinkled
      over the front one, vans of elegant furniture arrived, spring blinds were
      fitted to the windows, carpenters who had been employed in the various
      preparations, alterations, and repairs, made confidential statements to
      the different maid-servants in the row, relative to the magnificent scale
      on which the Miss Willises were commencing; the maid-servants told their
      'Missises,' the Missises told their friends, and vague rumours were
      circulated throughout the parish, that No. 25, in Gordon-place, had been
      taken by four maiden ladies of immense property.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, the Miss Willises moved in; and then the 'calling' began. The
      house was the perfection of neatness-so were the four Miss Willises.
      Everything was formal, stiff, and cold-so were the four Miss Willises. Not
      a single chair of the whole set was ever seen out of its place-not a
      single Miss Willis of the whole four was ever seen out of hers. There they
      always sat, in the same places, doing precisely the same things at the
      same hour. The eldest Miss Willis used to knit, the second to draw, the
      two others to play duets on the piano. They seemed to have no separate
      existence, but to have made up their minds just to winter through life
      together. They were three long graces in drapery, with the addition, like
      a school-dinner, of another long grace afterwards-the three fates with
      another sister-the Siamese twins multiplied by two. The eldest Miss Willis
      grew bilious-the four Miss Willises grew bilious immediately. The eldest
      Miss Willis grew ill-tempered and religious-the four Miss Willises were
      ill-tempered and religious directly. Whatever the eldest did, the others
      did, and whatever anybody else did, they all disapproved of; and thus they
      vegetated-living in Polar harmony among themselves, and, as they sometimes
      went out, or saw company 'in a quiet- way' at home, occasionally icing the
      neighbours. Three years passed over in this way, when an unlooked for and
      extraordinary phenomenon occurred. The Miss Willises showed symptoms of
      summer, the frost gradually broke up; a complete thaw took place. Was it
      possible? one of the four Miss Willises was going to be married!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, where on earth the husband came from, by what feelings the poor man
      could have been actuated, or by what process of reasoning the four Miss
      Willises succeeded in persuading themselves that it was possible for a man
      to marry one of them, without marrying them all, are questions too
      profound for us to resolve: certain it is, however, that the visits of Mr.
      Robinson (a gentleman in a public office, with a good salary and a little
      property of his own, besides) were received-that the four Miss Willises
      were courted in due form by the said Mr Robinson-that the neighbours were
      perfectly frantic in their anxiety to discover which of the four Miss
      Willises was the fortunate fair, and that the difficulty they experienced
      in solving the problem was not at all lessened by the announcement of the
      eldest Miss Willis,-'We are going to marry Mr. Robinson.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very extraordinary. They were so completely identified, the one
      with the other, that the curiosity of the whole row-even of the old lady
      herself-was roused almost beyond endurance. The subject was discussed at
      every little card-table and tea-drinking. The old gentleman of silk- worm
      notoriety did not hesitate to express his decided opinion that Mr.
      Robinson was of Eastern descent, and contemplated marrying the whole
      family at once; and the row, generally, shook their heads with
      considerable gravity, and declared the business to be very mysterious.
      They hoped it might all end well;-it certainly had a very singular
      appearance, but still it would be uncharitable to express any opinion
      without good grounds to go upon, and certainly the Miss Willises were
      quite old enough to judge for themselves, and to be sure people ought to
      know their own business best, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one fine morning, at a quarter before eight o'clock, a.m., two
      glass-coaches drove up to the Miss Willises' door, at which Mr. Robinson
      had arrived in a cab ten minutes before, dressed in a light-blue coat and
      double-milled kersey pantaloons, white neckerchief, pumps, and
      dress-gloves, his manner denoting, as appeared from the evidence of the
      housemaid at No. 23, who was sweeping the door-steps at the time, a
      considerable degree of nervous excitement. It was also hastily reported on
      the same testimony, that the cook who opened the door, wore a large white
      bow of unusual dimensions, in a much smarter head-dress than the
      regulation cap to which the Miss Willises invariably restricted the
      somewhat excursive tastes of female servants in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligence spread rapidly from house to house. It was quite clear
      that the eventful morning had at length arrived; the whole row stationed
      themselves behind their first and second floor blinds, and waited the
      result in breathless expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the Miss Willises' door opened; the door of the first glass- coach
      did the same. Two gentlemen, and a pair of ladies to correspond-friends of
      the family, no doubt; up went the steps, bang went the door, off went the
      first class-coach, and up came the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street door opened again; the excitement of the whole row
      increased-Mr. Robinson and the eldest Miss Willis. 'I thought so,' said
      the lady at No. 19; 'I always said it was Miss Willis!'-'Well, I never!'
      ejaculated the young lady at No. 18 to the young lady at No. 17.-'Did you
      ever, dear!' responded the young lady at No. 17 to the young lady at No.
      18. 'It's too ridiculous!' exclaimed a spinster of an uncertain age, at
      No. 16, joining in the conversation. But who shall portray the
      astonishment of Gordon-place, when Mr. Robinson handed in all the Miss
      Willises, one after the other, and then squeezed himself into an acute
      angle of the glass-coach, which forthwith proceeded at a brisk pace, after
      the other glass-coach, which other glass-coach had itself proceeded, at a
      brisk pace, in the direction of the parish church! Who shall depict the
      perplexity of the clergyman, when all the Miss Willises knelt down at the
      communion-table, and repeated the responses incidental to the marriage
      service in an audible voice-or who shall describe the confusion which
      prevailed, when-even after the difficulties thus occasioned had been
      adjusted-all the Miss Willises went into hysterics at the conclusion of
      the ceremony, until the sacred edifice resounded with their united
      wailings!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the four sisters and Mr. Robinson continued to occupy the same house
      after this memorable occasion, and as the married sister, whoever she was,
      never appeared in public without the other three, we are not quite clear
      that the neighbours ever would have discovered the real Mrs. Robinson, but
      for a circumstance of the most gratifying description, which will happen
      occasionally in the best-regulated families. Three quarter-days elapsed,
      and the row, on whom a new light appeared to have been bursting for some
      time, began to speak with a sort of implied confidence on the subject, and
      to wonder how Mrs. Robinson-the youngest Miss Willis that was-got on; and
      servants might be seen running up the steps, about nine or ten o'clock
      every morning, with 'Missis's compliments, and wishes to know how Mrs.
      Robinson finds herself this morning?' And the answer always was, 'Mrs.
      Robinson's compliments, and she's in very good spirits, and doesn't find
      herself any worse.' The piano was heard no longer, the knitting-needles
      were laid aside, drawing was neglected, and mantua-making and millinery,
      on the smallest scale imaginable, appeared to have become the favourite
      amusement of the whole family. The parlour wasn't quite as tidy as it used
      to be, and if you called in the morning, you would see lying on a table,
      with an old newspaper carelessly thrown over them, two or three
      particularly small caps, rather larger than if they had been made for a
      moderate-sized doll, with a small piece of lace, in the shape of a
      horse-shoe, let in behind: or perhaps a white robe, not very large in
      circumference, but very much out of proportion in point of length, with a
      little tucker round the top, and a frill round the bottom; and once when
      we called, we saw a long white roller, with a kind of blue margin down
      each side, the probable use of which, we were at a loss to conjecture.
      Then we fancied that Dr. Dawson, the surgeon, &amp;c., who displays a
      large lamp with a different colour in every pane of glass, at the corner
      of the row, began to be knocked up at night oftener than he used to be;
      and once we were very much alarmed by hearing a hackney-coach stop at Mrs.
      Robinson's door, at half-past two o'clock in the morning, out of which
      there emerged a fat old woman, in a cloak and night-cap, with a bundle in
      one hand, and a pair of pattens in the other, who looked as if she had
      been suddenly knocked up out of bed for some very special purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got up in the morning we saw that the knocker was tied up in an
      old white kid glove; and we, in our innocence (we were in a state of
      bachelorship then), wondered what on earth it all meant, until we heard
      the eldest Miss Willis, in propriAc personAc say, with great dignity, in
      answer to the next inquiry, 'My compliments, and Mrs. Robinson's doing as
      well as can be expected, and the little girl thrives wonderfully.' And
      then, in common with the rest of the row, our curiosity was satisfied, and
      we began to wonder it had never occurred to us what the matter was,
      before.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV-THE ELECTION FOR BEADLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A great event has recently occurred in our parish. A contest of paramount
      interest has just terminated; a parochial convulsion has taken place. It
      has been succeeded by a glorious triumph, which the country-or at least
      the parish-it is all the same-will long remember. We have had an election;
      an election for beadle. The supporters of the old beadle system have been
      defeated in their stronghold, and the advocates of the great new beadle
      principles have achieved a proud victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our parish, which, like all other parishes, is a little world of its own,
      has long been divided into two parties, whose contentions, slumbering for
      a while, have never failed to burst forth with unabated vigour, on any
      occasion on which they could by possibility be renewed. Watching-rates,
      lighting-rates, paving-rates, sewer's-rates, church- rates,
      poor's-rates-all sorts of rates, have been in their turns the subjects of
      a grand struggle; and as to questions of patronage, the asperity and
      determination with which they have been contested is scarcely credible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leader of the official party-the steady advocate of the churchwardens,
      and the unflinching supporter of the overseers-is an old gentleman who
      lives in our row. He owns some half a dozen houses in it, and always walks
      on the opposite side of the way, so that he may be able to take in a view
      of the whole of his property at once. He is a tall, thin, bony man, with
      an interrogative nose, and little restless perking eyes, which appear to
      have been given him for the sole purpose of peeping into other people's
      affairs with. He is deeply impressed with the importance of our parish
      business, and prides himself, not a little, on his style of addressing the
      parishioners in vestry assembled. His views are rather confined than
      extensive; his principles more narrow than liberal. He has been heard to
      declaim very loudly in favour of the liberty of the press, and advocates
      the repeal of the stamp duty on newspapers, because the daily journals who
      now have a monopoly of the public, never give verbatim reports of vestry
      meetings. He would not appear egotistical for the world, but at the same
      time he must say, that there are speeches-that celebrated speech of his
      own, on the emoluments of the sexton, and the duties of the office, for
      instance-which might be communicated to the public, greatly to their
      improvement and advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      His great opponent in public life is Captain Purday, the old naval officer
      on half-pay, to whom we have already introduced our readers. The captain
      being a determined opponent of the constituted authorities, whoever they
      may chance to be, and our other friend being their steady supporter, with
      an equal disregard of their individual merits, it will readily be
      supposed, that occasions for their coming into direct collision are
      neither few nor far between. They divided the vestry fourteen times on a
      motion for heating the church with warm water instead of coals: and made
      speeches about liberty and expenditure, and prodigality and hot water,
      which threw the whole parish into a state of excitement. Then the captain,
      when he was on the visiting committee, and his opponent overseer, brought
      forward certain distinct and specific charges relative to the management
      of the workhouse, boldly expressed his total want of confidence in the
      existing authorities, and moved for 'a copy of the recipe by which the
      paupers' soup was prepared, together with any documents relating thereto.'
      This the overseer steadily resisted; he fortified himself by precedent,
      appealed to the established usage, and declined to produce the papers, on
      the ground of the injury that would be done to the public service, if
      documents of a strictly private nature, passing between the master of the
      workhouse and the cook, were to be thus dragged to light on the motion of
      any individual member of the vestry. The motion was lost by a majority of
      two; and then the captain, who never allows himself to be defeated, moved
      for a committee of inquiry into the whole subject. The affair grew
      serious: the question was discussed at meeting after meeting, and vestry
      after vestry; speeches were made, attacks repudiated, personal defiances
      exchanged, explanations received, and the greatest excitement prevailed,
      until at last, just as the question was going to be finally decided, the
      vestry found that somehow or other, they had become entangled in a point
      of form, from which it was impossible to escape with propriety. So, the
      motion was dropped, and everybody looked extremely important, and seemed
      quite satisfied with the meritorious nature of the whole proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the state of affairs in our parish a week or two since, when
      Simmons, the beadle, suddenly died. The lamented deceased had over-
      exerted himself, a day or two previously, in conveying an aged female,
      highly intoxicated, to the strong room of the work-house. The excitement
      thus occasioned, added to a severe cold, which this indefatigable officer
      had caught in his capacity of director of the parish engine, by
      inadvertently playing over himself instead of a fire, proved too much for
      a constitution already enfeebled by age; and the intelligence was conveyed
      to the Board one evening that Simmons had died, and left his respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breath was scarcely out of the body of the deceased functionary, when
      the field was filled with competitors for the vacant office, each of whom
      rested his claims to public support, entirely on the number and extent of
      his family, as if the office of beadle were originally instituted as an
      encouragement for the propagation of the human species. 'Bung for Beadle.
      Five small children!'-'Hopkins for Beadle. Seven small
      children!!'-'Timkins for Beadle. Nine small children!!!' Such were the
      placards in large black letters on a white ground, which were plentifully
      pasted on the walls, and posted in the windows of the principal shops.
      Timkins's success was considered certain: several mothers of families half
      promised their votes, and the nine small children would have run over the
      course, but for the production of another placard, announcing the
      appearance of a still more meritorious candidate. 'Spruggins for Beadle.
      Ten small children (two of them twins), and a wife!!!' There was no
      resisting this; ten small children would have been almost irresistible in
      themselves, without the twins, but the touching parenthesis about that
      interesting production of nature, and the still more touching allusion to
      Mrs. Spruggins, must ensure success. Spruggins was the favourite at once,
      and the appearance of his lady, as she went about to solicit votes (which
      encouraged confident hopes of a still further addition to the house of
      Spruggins at no remote period), increased the general prepossession in his
      favour. The other candidates, Bung alone excepted, resigned in despair.
      The day of election was fixed; and the canvass proceeded with briskness
      and perseverance on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The members of the vestry could not be supposed to escape the contagious
      excitement inseparable from the occasion. The majority of the lady
      inhabitants of the parish declared at once for Spruggins; and the quondam
      overseer took the same side, on the ground that men with large families
      always had been elected to the office, and that although he must admit,
      that, in other respects, Spruggins was the least qualified candidate of
      the two, still it was an old practice, and he saw no reason why an old
      practice should be departed from. This was enough for the captain. He
      immediately sided with Bung, canvassed for him personally in all
      directions, wrote squibs on Spruggins, and got his butcher to skewer them
      up on conspicuous joints in his shop-front; frightened his neighbour, the
      old lady, into a palpitation of the heart, by his awful denunciations of
      Spruggins's party; and bounced in and out, and up and down, and backwards
      and forwards, until all the sober inhabitants of the parish thought it
      inevitable that he must die of a brain fever, long before the election
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of election arrived. It was no longer an individual struggle, but
      a party contest between the ins and outs. The question was, whether the
      withering influence of the overseers, the domination of the churchwardens,
      and the blighting despotism of the vestry-clerk, should be allowed to
      render the election of beadle a form-a nullity: whether they should impose
      a vestry-elected beadle on the parish, to do their bidding and forward
      their views, or whether the parishioners, fearlessly asserting their
      undoubted rights, should elect an independent beadle of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nomination was fixed to take place in the vestry, but so great was the
      throng of anxious spectators, that it was found necessary to adjourn to
      the church, where the ceremony commenced with due solemnity. The
      appearance of the churchwardens and overseers, and the ex-churchwardens
      and ex-overseers, with Spruggins in the rear, excited general attention.
      Spruggins was a little thin man, in rusty black, with a long pale face,
      and a countenance expressive of care and fatigue, which might either be
      attributed to the extent of his family or the anxiety of his feelings. His
      opponent appeared in a cast-off coat of the captain's-a blue coat with
      bright buttons; white trousers, and that description of shoes familiarly
      known by the appellation of 'high-lows.' There was a serenity in the open
      countenance of Bung-a kind of moral dignity in his confident air-an 'I
      wish you may get it' sort of expression in his eye-which infused animation
      into his supporters, and evidently dispirited his opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ex-churchwarden rose to propose Thomas Spruggins for beadle. He had
      known him long. He had had his eye upon him closely for years; he had
      watched him with twofold vigilance for months. (A parishioner here
      suggested that this might be termed 'taking a double sight,' but the
      observation was drowned in loud cries of 'Order!') He would repeat that he
      had had his eye upon him for years, and this he would say, that a more
      well-conducted, a more well-behaved, a more sober, a more quiet man, with
      a more well-regulated mind, he had never met with. A man with a larger
      family he had never known (cheers). The parish required a man who could be
      depended on ('Hear!' from the Spruggins side, answered by ironical cheers
      from the Bung party). Such a man he now proposed ('No,' 'Yes'). He would
      not allude to individuals (the ex-churchwarden continued, in the
      celebrated negative style adopted by great speakers). He would not advert
      to a gentleman who had once held a high rank in the service of his
      majesty; he would not say, that that gentleman was no gentleman; he would
      not assert, that that man was no man; he would not say, that he was a
      turbulent parishioner; he would not say, that he had grossly misbehaved
      himself, not only on this, but on all former occasions; he would not say,
      that he was one of those discontented and treasonable spirits, who carried
      confusion and disorder wherever they went; he would not say, that he
      harboured in his heart envy, and hatred, and malice, and all
      uncharitableness. No! He wished to have everything comfortable and
      pleasant, and therefore, he would say-nothing about him (cheers).
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain replied in a similar parliamentary style. He would not say, he
      was astonished at the speech they had just heard; he would not say, he was
      disgusted (cheers). He would not retort the epithets which had been hurled
      against him (renewed cheering); he would not allude to men once in office,
      but now happily out of it, who had mismanaged the workhouse, ground the
      paupers, diluted the beer, slack-baked the bread, boned the meat,
      heightened the work, and lowered the soup (tremendous cheers). He would
      not ask what such men deserved (a voice, 'Nothing a- day, and find
      themselves!'). He would not say, that one burst of general indignation
      should drive them from the parish they polluted with their presence ('Give
      it him!'). He would not allude to the unfortunate man who had been
      proposed-he would not say, as the vestry's tool, but as Beadle. He would
      not advert to that individual's family; he would not say, that nine
      children, twins, and a wife, were very bad examples for pauper imitation
      (loud cheers). He would not advert in detail to the qualifications of
      Bung. The man stood before him, and he would not say in his presence, what
      he might be disposed to say of him, if he were absent. (Here Mr. Bung
      telegraphed to a friend near him, under cover of his hat, by contracting
      his left eye, and applying his right thumb to the tip of his nose). It had
      been objected to Bung that he had only five children ('Hear, hear!' from
      the opposition). Well; he had yet to learn that the legislature had
      affixed any precise amount of infantine qualification to the office of
      beadle; but taking it for granted that an extensive family were a great
      requisite, he entreated them to look to facts, and compare data, about
      which there could be no mistake. Bung was 35 years of age. Spruggins-of
      whom he wished to speak with all possible respect-was 50. Was it not more
      than possible-was it not very probable-that by the time Bung attained the
      latter age, he might see around him a family, even exceeding in number and
      extent, that to which Spruggins at present laid claim (deafening cheers
      and waving of handkerchiefs)? The captain concluded, amidst loud applause,
      by calling upon the parishioners to sound the tocsin, rush to the poll,
      free themselves from dictation, or be slaves for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day the polling began, and we never have had such a
      bustle in our parish since we got up our famous anti-slavery petition,
      which was such an important one, that the House of Commons ordered it to
      be printed, on the motion of the member for the district. The captain
      engaged two hackney-coaches and a cab for Bung's people-the cab for the
      drunken voters, and the two coaches for the old ladies, the greater
      portion of whom, owing to the captain's impetuosity, were driven up to the
      poll and home again, before they recovered from their flurry sufficiently
      to know, with any degree of clearness, what they had been doing. The
      opposite party wholly neglected these precautions, and the consequence
      was, that a great many ladies who were walking leisurely up to the
      church-for it was a very hot day-to vote for Spruggins, were artfully
      decoyed into the coaches, and voted for Bung. The captain's arguments,
      too, had produced considerable effect: the attempted influence of the
      vestry produced a greater. A threat of exclusive dealing was clearly
      established against the vestry-clerk-a case of heartless and profligate
      atrocity. It appeared that the delinquent had been in the habit of
      purchasing six penn'orth of muffins, weekly, from an old woman who rents a
      small house in the parish, and resides among the original settlers; on her
      last weekly visit, a message was conveyed to her through the medium of the
      cook, couched in mysterious terms, but indicating with sufficient
      clearness, that the vestry-clerk's appetite for muffins, in future,
      depended entirely on her vote on the beadleship. This was sufficient: the
      stream had been turning previously, and the impulse thus administered
      directed its final course. The Bung party ordered one shilling's-worth of
      muffins weekly for the remainder of the old woman's natural life; the
      parishioners were loud in their exclamations; and the fate of Spruggins
      was sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that the twins were exhibited in dresses of the same
      pattern, and night-caps, to match, at the church door: the boy in Mrs.
      Spruggins's right arm, and the girl in her left-even Mrs. Spruggins
      herself failed to be an object of sympathy any longer. The majority
      attained by Bung on the gross poll was four hundred and twenty-eight, and
      the cause of the parishioners triumphed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V-THE BROKER'S MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The excitement of the late election has subsided, and our parish being
      once again restored to a state of comparative tranquillity, we are enabled
      to devote our attention to those parishioners who take little share in our
      party contests or in the turmoil and bustle of public life. And we feel
      sincere pleasure in acknowledging here, that in collecting materials for
      this task we have been greatly assisted by Mr. Bung himself, who has
      imposed on us a debt of obligation which we fear we can never repay. The
      life of this gentleman has been one of a very chequered description: he
      has undergone transitions-not from grave to gay, for he never was
      grave-not from lively to severe, for severity forms no part of his
      disposition; his fluctuations have been between poverty in the extreme,
      and poverty modified, or, to use his own emphatic language, 'between
      nothing to eat and just half enough.' He is not, as he forcibly remarks,
      'one of those fortunate men who, if they were to dive under one side of a
      barge stark-naked, would come up on the other with a new suit of clothes
      on, and a ticket for soup in the waistcoat-pocket:' neither is he one of
      those, whose spirit has been broken beyond redemption by misfortune and
      want. He is just one of the careless, good-for-nothing, happy fellows, who
      float, cork-like, on the surface, for the world to play at hockey with:
      knocked here, and there, and everywhere: now to the right, then to the
      left, again up in the air, and anon to the bottom, but always reappearing
      and bounding with the stream buoyantly and merrily along. Some few months
      before he was prevailed upon to stand a contested election for the office
      of beadle, necessity attached him to the service of a broker; and on the
      opportunities he here acquired of ascertaining the condition of most of
      the poorer inhabitants of the parish, his patron, the captain, first
      grounded his claims to public support. Chance threw the man in our way a
      short time since. We were, in the first instance, attracted by his
      prepossessing impudence at the election; we were not surprised, on further
      acquaintance, to find him a shrewd, knowing fellow, with no inconsiderable
      power of observation; and, after conversing with him a little, were
      somewhat struck (as we dare say our readers have frequently been in other
      cases) with the power some men seem to have, not only of sympathising
      with, but to all appearance of understanding feelings to which they
      themselves are entire strangers. We had been expressing to the new
      functionary our surprise that he should ever have served in the capacity
      to which we have just adverted, when we gradually led him into one or two
      professional anecdotes. As we are induced to think, on reflection, that
      they will tell better in nearly his own words, than with any attempted
      embellishments of ours, we will at once entitle them.
    </p>
    <h3>
      MR BUNG'S NARRATIVE
    </h3>
    <p>
      'It's very true, as you say, sir,' Mr. Bung commenced, 'that a broker's
      man's is not a life to be envied; and in course you know as well as I do,
      though you don't say it, that people hate and scout 'em because they're
      the ministers of wretchedness, like, to poor people. But what could I do,
      sir? The thing was no worse because I did it, instead of somebody else;
      and if putting me in possession of a house would put me in possession of
      three and sixpence a day, and levying a distress on another man's goods
      would relieve my distress and that of my family, it can't be expected but
      what I'd take the job and go through with it. I never liked it, God knows;
      I always looked out for something else, and the moment I got other work to
      do, I left it. If there is anything wrong in being the agent in such
      matters-not the principal, mind you-I'm sure the business, to a beginner
      like I was, at all events, carries its own punishment along with it. I
      wished again and again that the people would only blow me up, or pitch
      into me-that I wouldn't have minded, it's all in my way; but it's the
      being shut up by yourself in one room for five days, without so much as an
      old newspaper to look at, or anything to see out o' the winder but the
      roofs and chimneys at the back of the house, or anything to listen to, but
      the ticking, perhaps, of an old Dutch clock, the sobbing of the missis,
      now and then, the low talking of friends in the next room, who speak in
      whispers, lest "the man" should overhear them, or perhaps the occasional
      opening of the door, as a child peeps in to look at you, and then runs
      half-frightened away-it's all this, that makes you feel sneaking somehow,
      and ashamed of yourself; and then, if it's wintertime, they just give you
      fire enough to make you think you'd like more, and bring in your grub as
      if they wished it 'ud choke you-as I dare say they do, for the matter of
      that, most heartily. If they're very civil, they make you up a bed in the
      room at night, and if they don't, your master sends one in for you; but
      there you are, without being washed or shaved all the time, shunned by
      everybody, and spoken to by no one, unless some one comes in at dinner-
      time, and asks you whether you want any more, in a tone as much to say, "I
      hope you don't," or, in the evening, to inquire whether you wouldn't
      rather have a candle, after you've been sitting in the dark half the
      night. When I was left in this way, I used to sit, think, think, thinking,
      till I felt as lonesome as a kitten in a wash-house copper with the lid
      on; but I believe the old brokers' men who are regularly trained to it,
      never think at all. I have heard some on 'em say, indeed, that they don't
      know how!
    </p>
    <p>
      'I put in a good many distresses in my time (continued Mr. Bung), and in
      course I wasn't long in finding, that some people are not as much to be
      pitied as others are, and that people with good incomes who get into
      difficulties, which they keep patching up day after day and week after
      week, get so used to these sort of things in time, that at last they come
      scarcely to feel them at all. I remember the very first place I was put in
      possession of, was a gentleman's house in this parish here, that everybody
      would suppose couldn't help having money if he tried. I went with old
      Fixem, my old master, 'bout half arter eight in the morning; rang the
      area-bell; servant in livery opened the door: "Governor at home?"-"Yes, he
      is," says the man; "but he's breakfasting just now." "Never mind," says
      Fixem, "just you tell him there's a gentleman here, as wants to speak to
      him partickler." So the servant he opens his eyes, and stares about him
      all ways-looking for the gentleman, as it struck me, for I don't think
      anybody but a man as was stone-blind would mistake Fixem for one; and as
      for me, I was as seedy as a cheap cowcumber. Hows'ever, he turns round,
      and goes to the breakfast- parlour, which was a little snug sort of room
      at the end of the passage, and Fixem (as we always did in that
      profession), without waiting to be announced, walks in arter him, and
      before the servant could get out, "Please, sir, here's a man as wants to
      speak to you," looks in at the door as familiar and pleasant as may be.
      "Who the devil are you, and how dare you walk into a gentleman's house
      without leave?" says the master, as fierce as a bull in fits. "My name,"
      says Fixem, winking to the master to send the servant away, and putting
      the warrant into his hands folded up like a note, "My name's Smith," says
      he, "and I called from Johnson's about that business of Thompson's."-"Oh,"
      says the other, quite down on him directly, "How is Thompson?" says he;
      "Pray sit down, Mr. Smith: John, leave the room." Out went the servant;
      and the gentleman and Fixem looked at one another till they couldn't look
      any longer, and then they varied the amusements by looking at me, who had
      been standing on the mat all this time. "Hundred and fifty pounds, I see,"
      said the gentleman at last. "Hundred and fifty pound," said Fixem,
      "besides cost of levy, sheriff's poundage, and all other incidental
      expenses."-"Um," says the gentleman, "I shan't be able to settle this
      before to-morrow afternoon."-"Very sorry; but I shall be obliged to leave
      my man here till then," replies Fixem, pretending to look very miserable
      over it. "That's very unfort'nate," says the gentleman, "for I have got a
      large party here to-night, and I'm ruined if those fellows of mine get an
      inkling of the matter-just step here, Mr. Smith," says he, after a short
      pause. So Fixem walks with him up to the window, and after a good deal of
      whispering, and a little chinking of suverins, and looking at me, he comes
      back and says, "Bung, you're a handy fellow, and very honest I know. This
      gentleman wants an assistant to clean the plate and wait at table to-day,
      and if you're not particularly engaged," says old Fixem, grinning like
      mad, and shoving a couple of suverins into my hand, "he'll be very glad to
      avail himself of your services." Well, I laughed: and the gentleman
      laughed, and we all laughed; and I went home and cleaned myself, leaving
      Fixem there, and when I went back, Fixem went away, and I polished up the
      plate, and waited at table, and gammoned the servants, and nobody had the
      least idea I was in possession, though it very nearly came out after all;
      for one of the last gentlemen who remained, came down-stairs into the hall
      where I was sitting pretty late at night, and putting half-a-crown into my
      hand, says, "Here, my man," says he, "run and get me a coach, will you?" I
      thought it was a do, to get me out of the house, and was just going to say
      so, sulkily enough, when the gentleman (who was up to everything) came
      running down-stairs, as if he was in great anxiety. "Bung," says he,
      pretending to be in a consuming passion. "Sir," says I. "Why the devil
      an't you looking after that plate?"-"I was just going to send him for a
      coach for me," says the other gentleman. "And I was just a-going to say,"
      says I-"Anybody else, my dear fellow," interrupts the master of the house,
      pushing me down the passage to get out of the way-"anybody else; but I
      have put this man in possession of all the plate and valuables, and I
      cannot allow him on any consideration whatever, to leave the house. Bung,
      you scoundrel, go and count those forks in the breakfast-parlour
      instantly." You may be sure I went laughing pretty hearty when I found it
      was all right. The money was paid next day, with the addition of something
      else for myself, and that was the best job that I (and I suspect old Fixem
      too) ever got in that line.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But this is the bright side of the picture, sir, after all,' resumed Mr.
      Bung, laying aside the knowing look and flash air, with which he had
      repeated the previous anecdote-'and I'm sorry to say, it's the side one
      sees very, very seldom, in comparison with the dark one. The civility
      which money will purchase, is rarely extended to those who have none; and
      there's a consolation even in being able to patch up one difficulty, to
      make way for another, to which very poor people are strangers. I was once
      put into a house down George's-yard-that little dirty court at the back of
      the gas-works; and I never shall forget the misery of them people, dear
      me! It was a distress for half a year's rent-two pound ten, I think. There
      was only two rooms in the house, and as there was no passage, the lodgers
      up-stairs always went through the room of the people of the house, as they
      passed in and out; and every time they did so-which, on the average, was
      about four times every quarter of an hour-they blowed up quite frightful:
      for their things had been seized too, and included in the inventory. There
      was a little piece of enclosed dust in front of the house, with a
      cinder-path leading up to the door, and an open rain-water butt on one
      side. A dirty striped curtain, on a very slack string, hung in the window,
      and a little triangular bit of broken looking-glass rested on the sill
      inside. I suppose it was meant for the people's use, but their appearance
      was so wretched, and so miserable, that I'm certain they never could have
      plucked up courage to look themselves in the face a second time, if they
      survived the fright of doing so once. There was two or three chairs, that
      might have been worth, in their best days, from eightpence to a shilling
      a-piece; a small deal table, an old corner cupboard with nothing in it,
      and one of those bedsteads which turn up half way, and leave the bottom
      legs sticking out for you to knock your head against, or hang your hat
      upon; no bed, no bedding. There was an old sack, by way of rug, before the
      fireplace, and four or five children were grovelling about, among the sand
      on the floor. The execution was only put in, to get 'em out of the house,
      for there was nothing to take to pay the expenses; and here I stopped for
      three days, though that was a mere form too: for, in course, I knew, and
      we all knew, they could never pay the money. In one of the chairs, by the
      side of the place where the fire ought to have been, was an old 'ooman-the
      ugliest and dirtiest I ever see-who sat rocking herself backwards and
      forwards, backwards and forwards, without once stopping, except for an
      instant now and then, to clasp together the withered hands which, with
      these exceptions, she kept constantly rubbing upon her knees, just raising
      and depressing her fingers convulsively, in time to the rocking of the
      chair. On the other side sat the mother with an infant in her arms, which
      cried till it cried itself to sleep, and when it 'woke, cried till it
      cried itself off again. The old 'ooman's voice I never heard: she seemed
      completely stupefied; and as to the mother's, it would have been better if
      she had been so too, for misery had changed her to a devil. If you had
      heard how she cursed the little naked children as was rolling on the
      floor, and seen how savagely she struck the infant when it cried with
      hunger, you'd have shuddered as much as I did. There they remained all the
      time: the children ate a morsel of bread once or twice, and I gave 'em
      best part of the dinners my missis brought me, but the woman ate nothing;
      they never even laid on the bedstead, nor was the room swept or cleaned
      all the time. The neighbours were all too poor themselves to take any
      notice of 'em, but from what I could make out from the abuse of the woman
      up-stairs, it seemed the husband had been transported a few weeks before.
      When the time was up, the landlord and old Fixem too, got rather
      frightened about the family, and so they made a stir about it, and had 'em
      taken to the workhouse. They sent the sick couch for the old 'ooman, and
      Simmons took the children away at night. The old 'ooman went into the
      infirmary, and very soon died. The children are all in the house to this
      day, and very comfortable they are in comparison. As to the mother, there
      was no taming her at all. She had been a quiet, hard-working woman, I
      believe, but her misery had actually drove her wild; so after she had been
      sent to the house of correction half-a-dozen times, for throwing inkstands
      at the overseers, blaspheming the churchwardens, and smashing everybody as
      come near her, she burst a blood-vessel one mornin', and died too; and a
      happy release it was, both for herself and the old paupers, male and
      female, which she used to tip over in all directions, as if they were so
      many skittles, and she the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now this was bad enough,' resumed Mr. Bung, taking a half-step towards
      the door, as if to intimate that he had nearly concluded. 'This was bad
      enough, but there was a sort of quiet misery-if you understand what I mean
      by that, sir-about a lady at one house I was put into, as touched me a
      good deal more. It doesn't matter where it was exactly: indeed, I'd rather
      not say, but it was the same sort o' job. I went with Fixem in the usual
      way-there was a year's rent in arrear; a very small servant-girl opened
      the door, and three or four fine-looking little children was in the front
      parlour we were shown into, which was very clean, but very scantily
      furnished, much like the children themselves. "Bung," says Fixem to me, in
      a low voice, when we were left alone for a minute, "I know something about
      this here family, and my opinion is, it's no go." "Do you think they can't
      settle?" says I, quite anxiously; for I liked the looks of them children.
      Fixem shook his head, and was just about to reply, when the door opened,
      and in come a lady, as white as ever I see any one in my days, except
      about the eyes, which were red with crying. She walked in, as firm as I
      could have done; shut the door carefully after her, and sat herself down
      with a face as composed as if it was made of stone. "What is the matter,
      gentlemen?" says she, in a surprisin' steady voice. "Is this an
      execution?" "It is, mum," says Fixem. The lady looked at him as steady as
      ever: she didn't seem to have understood him. "It is, mum," says Fixem
      again; "this is my warrant of distress, mum," says he, handing it over as
      polite as if it was a newspaper which had been bespoke arter the next
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The lady's lip trembled as she took the printed paper. She cast her eye
      over it, and old Fixem began to explain the form, but saw she wasn't
      reading it, plain enough, poor thing. "Oh, my God!" says she, suddenly
      a-bursting out crying, letting the warrant fall, and hiding her face in
      her hands. "Oh, my God! what will become of us!" The noise she made,
      brought in a young lady of about nineteen or twenty, who, I suppose, had
      been a-listening at the door, and who had got a little boy in her arms:
      she sat him down in the lady's lap, without speaking, and she hugged the
      poor little fellow to her bosom, and cried over him, till even old Fixem
      put on his blue spectacles to hide the two tears, that was a-trickling
      down, one on each side of his dirty face. "Now, dear ma," says the young
      lady, "you know how much you have borne. For all our sakes-for pa's sake,"
      says she, "don't give way to this!"-"No, no, I won't!" says the lady,
      gathering herself up, hastily, and drying her eyes; "I am very foolish,
      but I'm better now-much better." And then she roused herself up, went with
      us into every room while we took the inventory, opened all the drawers of
      her own accord, sorted the children's little clothes to make the work
      easier; and, except doing everything in a strange sort of hurry, seemed as
      calm and composed as if nothing had happened. When we came down-stairs
      again, she hesitated a minute or two, and at last says, "Gentlemen," says
      she, "I am afraid I have done wrong, and perhaps it may bring you into
      trouble. I secreted just now," she says, "the only trinket I have left in
      the world-here it is." So she lays down on the table a little miniature
      mounted in gold. "It's a miniature," she says, "of my poor dear father! I
      little thought once, that I should ever thank God for depriving me of the
      original, but I do, and have done for years back, most fervently. Take it
      away, sir," she says, "it's a face that never turned from me in sickness
      and distress, and I can hardly bear to turn from it now, when, God knows,
      I suffer both in no ordinary degree." I couldn't say nothing, but I raised
      my head from the inventory which I was filling up, and looked at Fixem;
      the old fellow nodded to me significantly, so I ran my pen through the
      "Mini" I had just written, and left the miniature on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sir, to make short of a long story, I was left in possession, and
      in possession I remained; and though I was an ignorant man, and the master
      of the house a clever one, I saw what he never did, but what he would give
      worlds now (if he had 'em) to have seen in time. I saw, sir, that his wife
      was wasting away, beneath cares of which she never complained, and griefs
      she never told. I saw that she was dying before his eyes; I knew that one
      exertion from him might have saved her, but he never made it. I don't
      blame him: I don't think he could rouse himself. She had so long
      anticipated all his wishes, and acted for him, that he was a lost man when
      left to himself. I used to think when I caught sight of her, in the
      clothes she used to wear, which looked shabby even upon her, and would
      have been scarcely decent on any one else, that if I was a gentleman it
      would wring my very heart to see the woman that was a smart and merry girl
      when I courted her, so altered through her love for me. Bitter cold and
      damp weather it was, yet, though her dress was thin, and her shoes none of
      the best, during the whole three days, from morning to night, she was out
      of doors running about to try and raise the money. The money was raised
      and the execution was paid out. The whole family crowded into the room
      where I was, when the money arrived. The father was quite happy as the
      inconvenience was removed-I dare say he didn't know how; the children
      looked merry and cheerful again; the eldest girl was bustling about,
      making preparations for the first comfortable meal they had had since the
      distress was put in; and the mother looked pleased to see them all so. But
      if ever I saw death in a woman's face, I saw it in hers that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was right, sir,' continued Mr. Bung, hurriedly passing his coat- sleeve
      over his face; 'the family grew more prosperous, and good fortune arrived.
      But it was too late. Those children are motherless now, and their father
      would give up all he has since gained-house, home, goods, money: all that
      he has, or ever can have, to restore the wife he has lost.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI-THE LADIES' SOCIETIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our Parish is very prolific in ladies' charitable institutions. In winter,
      when wet feet are common, and colds not scarce, we have the ladies' soup
      distribution society, the ladies' coal distribution society, and the
      ladies' blanket distribution society; in summer, when stone fruits
      flourish and stomach aches prevail, we have the ladies' dispensary, and
      the ladies' sick visitation committee; and all the year round we have the
      ladies' child's examination society, the ladies' bible and prayer-book
      circulation society, and the ladies' childbed-linen monthly loan society.
      The two latter are decidedly the most important; whether they are
      productive of more benefit than the rest, it is not for us to say, but we
      can take upon ourselves to affirm, with the utmost solemnity, that they
      create a greater stir and more bustle, than all the others put together.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should be disposed to affirm, on the first blush of the matter, that
      the bible and prayer-book society is not so popular as the childbed- linen
      society; the bible and prayer-book society has, however, considerably
      increased in importance within the last year or two, having derived some
      adventitious aid from the factious opposition of the child's examination
      society; which factious opposition originated in manner following:-When
      the young curate was popular, and all the unmarried ladies in the parish
      took a serious turn, the charity children all at once became objects of
      peculiar and especial interest. The three Miss Browns (enthusiastic
      admirers of the curate) taught, and exercised, and examined, and
      re-examined the unfortunate children, until the boys grew pale, and the
      girls consumptive with study and fatigue. The three Miss Browns stood it
      out very well, because they relieved each other; but the children, having
      no relief at all, exhibited decided symptoms of weariness and care. The
      unthinking part of the parishioners laughed at all this, but the more
      reflective portion of the inhabitants abstained from expressing any
      opinion on the subject until that of the curate had been clearly
      ascertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity was not long wanting. The curate preached a charity sermon
      on behalf of the charity school, and in the charity sermon aforesaid,
      expatiated in glowing terms on the praiseworthy and indefatigable
      exertions of certain estimable individuals. Sobs were heard to issue from
      the three Miss Browns' pew; the pew-opener of the division was seen to
      hurry down the centre aisle to the vestry door, and to return immediately,
      bearing a glass of water in her hand. A low moaning ensued; two more
      pew-openers rushed to the spot, and the three Miss Browns, each supported
      by a pew-opener, were led out of the church, and led in again after the
      lapse of five minutes with white pocket- handkerchiefs to their eyes, as
      if they had been attending a funeral in the churchyard adjoining. If any
      doubt had for a moment existed, as to whom the allusion was intended to
      apply, it was at once removed. The wish to enlighten the charity children
      became universal, and the three Miss Browns were unanimously besought to
      divide the school into classes, and to assign each class to the
      superintendence of two young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little learning is a dangerous thing, but a little patronage is more so;
      the three Miss Browns appointed all the old maids, and carefully excluded
      the young ones. Maiden aunts triumphed, mammas were reduced to the lowest
      depths of despair, and there is no telling in what act of violence the
      general indignation against the three Miss Browns might have vented
      itself, had not a perfectly providential occurrence changed the tide of
      public feeling. Mrs. Johnson Parker, the mother of seven extremely fine
      girls-all unmarried-hastily reported to several other mammas of several
      other unmarried families, that five old men, six old women, and children
      innumerable, in the free seats near her pew, were in the habit of coming
      to church every Sunday, without either bible or prayer-book. Was this to
      be borne in a civilised country? Could such things be tolerated in a
      Christian land? Never! A ladies' bible and prayer-book distribution
      society was instantly formed: president, Mrs. Johnson Parker; treasurers,
      auditors, and secretary, the Misses Johnson Parker: subscriptions were
      entered into, books were bought, all the free-seat people provided
      therewith, and when the first lesson was given out, on the first Sunday
      succeeding these events, there was such a dropping of books, and rustling
      of leaves, that it was morally impossible to hear one word of the service
      for five minutes afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three Miss Browns, and their party, saw the approaching danger, and
      endeavoured to avert it by ridicule and sarcasm. Neither the old men nor
      the old women could read their books, now they had got them, said the
      three Miss Browns. Never mind; they could learn, replied Mrs. Johnson
      Parker. The children couldn't read either, suggested the three Miss
      Browns. No matter; they could be taught, retorted Mrs. Johnson Parker. A
      balance of parties took place. The Miss Browns publicly examined-popular
      feeling inclined to the child's examination society. The Miss Johnson
      Parkers publicly distributed-a reaction took place in favour of the
      prayer-book distribution. A feather would have turned the scale, and a
      feather did turn it. A missionary returned from the West Indies; he was to
      be presented to the Dissenters' Missionary Society on his marriage with a
      wealthy widow. Overtures were made to the Dissenters by the Johnson
      Parkers. Their object was the same, and why not have a joint meeting of
      the two societies? The proposition was accepted. The meeting was duly
      heralded by public announcement, and the room was crowded to suffocation.
      The Missionary appeared on the platform; he was hailed with enthusiasm. He
      repeated a dialogue he had heard between two negroes, behind a hedge, on
      the subject of distribution societies; the approbation was tumultuous. He
      gave an imitation of the two negroes in broken English; the roof was rent
      with applause. From that period we date (with one trifling exception) a
      daily increase in the popularity of the distribution society, and an
      increase of popularity, which the feeble and impotent opposition of the
      examination party, has only tended to augment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the great points about the childbed-linen monthly loan society are,
      that it is less dependent on the fluctuations of public opinion than
      either the distribution or the child's examination; and that, come what
      may, there is never any lack of objects on which to exercise its
      benevolence. Our parish is a very populous one, and, if anything,
      contributes, we should be disposed to say, rather more than its due share
      to the aggregate amount of births in the metropolis and its environs. The
      consequence is, that the monthly loan society flourishes, and invests its
      members with a most enviable amount of bustling patronage. The society
      (whose only notion of dividing time, would appear to be its allotment into
      months) holds monthly tea-drinkings, at which the monthly report is
      received, a secretary elected for the month ensuing, and such of the
      monthly boxes as may not happen to be out on loan for the month, carefully
      examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were never present at one of these meetings, from all of which it is
      scarcely necessary to say, gentlemen are carefully excluded; but Mr. Bung
      has been called before the board once or twice, and we have his authority
      for stating, that its proceedings are conducted with great order and
      regularity: not more than four members being allowed to speak at one time
      on any pretence whatever. The regular committee is composed exclusively of
      married ladies, but a vast number of young unmarried ladies of from
      eighteen to twenty-five years of age, respectively, are admitted as
      honorary members, partly because they are very useful in replenishing the
      boxes, and visiting the confined; partly because it is highly desirable
      that they should be initiated, at an early period, into the more serious
      and matronly duties of after-life; and partly, because prudent mammas have
      not unfrequently been known to turn this circumstance to wonderfully good
      account in matrimonial speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the loan of the monthly boxes (which are always painted
      blue, with the name of the society in large white letters on the lid), the
      society dispense occasional grants of beef-tea, and a composition of warm
      beer, spice, eggs, and sugar, commonly known by the name of 'candle,' to
      its patients. And here again the services of the honorary members are
      called into requisition, and most cheerfully conceded. Deputations of twos
      or threes are sent out to visit the patients, and on these occasions there
      is such a tasting of candle and beef-tea, such a stirring about of little
      messes in tiny saucepans on the hob, such a dressing and undressing of
      infants, such a tying, and folding, and pinning; such a nursing and
      warming of little legs and feet before the fire, such a delightful
      confusion of talking and cooking, bustle, importance, and officiousness,
      as never can be enjoyed in its full extent but on similar occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In rivalry of these two institutions, and as a last expiring effort to
      acquire parochial popularity, the child's examination people determined,
      the other day, on having a grand public examination of the pupils; and the
      large school-room of the national seminary was, by and with the consent of
      the parish authorities, devoted to the purpose. Invitation circulars were
      forwarded to all the principal parishioners, including, of course, the
      heads of the other two societies, for whose especial behoof and
      edification the display was intended; and a large audience was confidently
      anticipated on the occasion. The floor was carefully scrubbed the day
      before, under the immediate superintendence of the three Miss Browns;
      forms were placed across the room for the accommodation of the visitors,
      specimens in writing were carefully selected, and as carefully patched and
      touched up, until they astonished the children who had written them,
      rather more than the company who read them; sums in compound addition were
      rehearsed and re-rehearsed until all the children had the totals by heart;
      and the preparations altogether were on the most laborious and most
      comprehensive scale. The morning arrived: the children were yellow-soaped
      and flannelled, and towelled, till their faces shone again; every pupil's
      hair was carefully combed into his or her eyes, as the case might be; the
      girls were adorned with snow-white tippets, and caps bound round the head
      by a single purple ribbon: the necks of the elder boys were fixed into
      collars of startling dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doors were thrown open, and the Misses Brown and Co. were discovered
      in plain white muslin dresses, and caps of the same-the child's
      examination uniform. The room filled: the greetings of the company were
      loud and cordial. The distributionists trembled, for their popularity was
      at stake. The eldest boy fell forward, and delivered a propitiatory
      address from behind his collar. It was from the pen of Mr. Henry Brown;
      the applause was universal, and the Johnson Parkers were aghast. The
      examination proceeded with success, and terminated in triumph. The child's
      examination society gained a momentary victory, and the Johnson Parkers
      retreated in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A secret council of the distributionists was held that night, with Mrs.
      Johnson Parker in the chair, to consider of the best means of recovering
      the ground they had lost in the favour of the parish. What could be done?
      Another meeting! Alas! who was to attend it? The Missionary would not do
      twice; and the slaves were emancipated. A bold step must be taken. The
      parish must be astonished in some way or other; but no one was able to
      suggest what the step should be. At length, a very old lady was heard to
      mumble, in indistinct tones, 'Exeter Hall.' A sudden light broke in upon
      the meeting. It was unanimously resolved, that a deputation of old ladies
      should wait upon a celebrated orator, imploring his assistance, and the
      favour of a speech; and the deputation should also wait on two or three
      other imbecile old women, not resident in the parish, and entreat their
      attendance. The application was successful, the meeting was held; the
      orator (an Irishman) came. He talked of green isles-other shores-vast
      Atlantic-bosom of the deep-Christian charity-blood and extermination-mercy
      in hearts-arms in hands-altars and homes-household gods. He wiped his
      eyes, he blew his nose, and he quoted Latin. The effect was tremendous-the
      Latin was a decided hit. Nobody knew exactly what it was about, but
      everybody knew it must be affecting, because even the orator was overcome.
      The popularity of the distribution society among the ladies of our parish
      is unprecedented; and the child's examination is going fast to decay.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII-OUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are very fond of speculating as we walk through a street, on the
      character and pursuits of the people who inhabit it; and nothing so
      materially assists us in these speculations as the appearance of the house
      doors. The various expressions of the human countenance afford a beautiful
      and interesting study; but there is something in the physiognomy of
      street-door knockers, almost as characteristic, and nearly as infallible.
      Whenever we visit a man for the first time, we contemplate the features of
      his knocker with the greatest curiosity, for we well know, that between
      the man and his knocker, there will inevitably be a greater or less degree
      of resemblance and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, there is one description of knocker that used to be common
      enough, but which is fast passing away-a large round one, with the jolly
      face of a convivial lion smiling blandly at you, as you twist the sides of
      your hair into a curl or pull up your shirt-collar while you are waiting
      for the door to be opened; we never saw that knocker on the door of a
      churlish man-so far as our experience is concerned, it invariably bespoke
      hospitality and another bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man ever saw this knocker on the door of a small attorney or bill-
      broker; they always patronise the other lion; a heavy ferocious-looking
      fellow, with a countenance expressive of savage stupidity-a sort of grand
      master among the knockers, and a great favourite with the selfish and
      brutal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there is a little pert Egyptian knocker, with a long thin face, a
      pinched-up nose, and a very sharp chin; he is most in vogue with your
      government-office people, in light drabs and starched cravats; little
      spare, priggish men, who are perfectly satisfied with their own opinions,
      and consider themselves of paramount importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were greatly troubled a few years ago, by the innovation of a new kind
      of knocker, without any face at all, composed of a wreath depending from a
      hand or small truncheon. A little trouble and attention, however, enabled
      us to overcome this difficulty, and to reconcile the new system to our
      favourite theory. You will invariably find this knocker on the doors of
      cold and formal people, who always ask you why you don't come, and never
      say do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody knows the brass knocker is common to suburban villas, and
      extensive boarding-schools; and having noticed this genus we have
      recapitulated all the most prominent and strongly-defined species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some phrenologists affirm, that the agitation of a man's brain by
      different passions, produces corresponding developments in the form of his
      skull. Do not let us be understood as pushing our theory to the full
      length of asserting, that any alteration in a man's disposition would
      produce a visible effect on the feature of his knocker. Our position
      merely is, that in such a case, the magnetism which must exist between a
      man and his knocker, would induce the man to remove, and seek some knocker
      more congenial to his altered feelings. If you ever find a man changing
      his habitation without any reasonable pretext, depend upon it, that,
      although he may not be aware of the fact himself, it is because he and his
      knocker are at variance. This is a new theory, but we venture to launch
      it, nevertheless, as being quite as ingenious and infallible as many
      thousands of the learned speculations which are daily broached for public
      good and private fortune-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entertaining these feelings on the subject of knockers, it will be readily
      imagined with what consternation we viewed the entire removal of the
      knocker from the door of the next house to the one we lived in, some time
      ago, and the substitution of a bell. This was a calamity we had never
      anticipated. The bare idea of anybody being able to exist without a
      knocker, appeared so wild and visionary, that it had never for one instant
      entered our imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sauntered moodily from the spot, and bent our steps towards Eaton-
      square, then just building. What was our astonishment and indignation to
      find that bells were fast becoming the rule, and knockers the exception!
      Our theory trembled beneath the shock. We hastened home; and fancying we
      foresaw in the swift progress of events, its entire abolition, resolved
      from that day forward to vent our speculations on our next-door neighbours
      in person. The house adjoining ours on the left hand was uninhabited, and
      we had, therefore, plenty of leisure to observe our next-door neighbours
      on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house without the knocker was in the occupation of a city clerk, and
      there was a neatly-written bill in the parlour window intimating that
      lodgings for a single gentleman were to be let within.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a neat, dull little house, on the shady side of the way, with new,
      narrow floorcloth in the passage, and new, narrow stair-carpets up to the
      first floor. The paper was new, and the paint was new, and the furniture
      was new; and all three, paper, paint, and furniture, bespoke the limited
      means of the tenant. There was a little red and black carpet in the
      drawing-room, with a border of flooring all the way round; a few stained
      chairs and a pembroke table. A pink shell was displayed on each of the
      little sideboards, which, with the addition of a tea-tray and caddy, a few
      more shells on the mantelpiece, and three peacock's feathers tastefully
      arranged above them, completed the decorative furniture of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the room destined for the reception of the single gentleman
      during the day, and a little back room on the same floor was assigned as
      his sleeping apartment by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bill had not been long in the window, when a stout, good-humoured
      looking gentleman, of about five-and-thirty, appeared as a candidate for
      the tenancy. Terms were soon arranged, for the bill was taken down
      immediately after his first visit. In a day or two the single gentleman
      came in, and shortly afterwards his real character came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, he displayed a most extraordinary partiality for sitting up
      till three or four o'clock in the morning, drinking whiskey-and- water,
      and smoking cigars; then he invited friends home, who used to come at ten
      o'clock, and begin to get happy about the small hours, when they evinced
      their perfect contentment by singing songs with half-a- dozen verses of
      two lines each, and a chorus of ten, which chorus used to be shouted forth
      by the whole strength of the company, in the most enthusiastic and
      vociferous manner, to the great annoyance of the neighbours, and the
      special discomfort of another single gentleman overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this was bad enough, occurring as it did three times a week on the
      average, but this was not all; for when the company did go away, instead
      of walking quietly down the street, as anybody else's company would have
      done, they amused themselves by making alarming and frightful noises, and
      counterfeiting the shrieks of females in distress; and one night, a
      red-faced gentleman in a white hat knocked in the most urgent manner at
      the door of the powdered-headed old gentleman at No. 3, and when the
      powdered-headed old gentleman, who thought one of his married daughters
      must have been taken ill prematurely, had groped down-stairs, and after a
      great deal of unbolting and key-turning, opened the street door, the
      red-faced man in the white hat said he hoped he'd excuse his giving him so
      much trouble, but he'd feel obliged if he'd favour him with a glass of
      cold spring water, and the loan of a shilling for a cab to take him home,
      on which the old gentleman slammed the door and went up-stairs, and threw
      the contents of his water jug out of window-very straight, only it went
      over the wrong man; and the whole street was involved in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A joke's a joke; and even practical jests are very capital in their way,
      if you can only get the other party to see the fun of them; but the
      population of our street were so dull of apprehension, as to be quite lost
      to a sense of the drollery of this proceeding: and the consequence was,
      that our next-door neighbour was obliged to tell the single gentleman,
      that unless he gave up entertaining his friends at home, he really must be
      compelled to part with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The single gentleman received the remonstrance with great good-humour, and
      promised from that time forward, to spend his evenings at a coffee-
      house-a determination which afforded general and unmixed satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night passed off very well, everybody being delighted with the
      change; but on the next, the noises were renewed with greater spirit than
      ever. The single gentleman's friends being unable to see him in his own
      house every alternate night, had come to the determination of seeing him
      home every night; and what with the discordant greetings of the friends at
      parting, and the noise created by the single gentleman in his passage
      up-stairs, and his subsequent struggles to get his boots off, the evil was
      not to be borne. So, our next-door neighbour gave the single gentleman,
      who was a very good lodger in other respects, notice to quit; and the
      single gentleman went away, and entertained his friends in other lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next applicant for the vacant first floor, was of a very different
      character from the troublesome single gentleman who had just quitted it.
      He was a tall, thin, young gentleman, with a profusion of brown hair,
      reddish whiskers, and very slightly developed moustaches. He wore a
      braided surtout, with frogs behind, light grey trousers, and wash- leather
      gloves, and had altogether rather a military appearance. So unlike the
      roystering single gentleman. Such insinuating manners, and such a
      delightful address! So seriously disposed, too! When he first came to look
      at the lodgings, he inquired most particularly whether he was sure to be
      able to get a seat in the parish church; and when he had agreed to take
      them, he requested to have a list of the different local charities, as he
      intended to subscribe his mite to the most deserving among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our next-door neighbour was now perfectly happy. He had got a lodger at
      last, of just his own way of thinking-a serious, well-disposed man, who
      abhorred gaiety, and loved retirement. He took down the bill with a light
      heart, and pictured in imagination a long series of quiet Sundays, on
      which he and his lodger would exchange mutual civilities and Sunday
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious man arrived, and his luggage was to arrive from the country
      next morning. He borrowed a clean shirt, and a prayer-book, from our
      next-door neighbour, and retired to rest at an early hour, requesting that
      he might be called punctually at ten o'clock next morning-not before, as
      he was much fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was called, and did not answer: he was called again, but there was no
      reply. Our next-door neighbour became alarmed, and burst the door open.
      The serious man had left the house mysteriously; carrying with him the
      shirt, the prayer-book, a teaspoon, and the bedclothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this occurrence, coupled with the irregularities of his former
      lodger, gave our next-door neighbour an aversion to single gentlemen, we
      know not; we only know that the next bill which made its appearance in the
      parlour window intimated generally, that there were furnished apartments
      to let on the first floor. The bill was soon removed. The new lodgers at
      first attracted our curiosity, and afterwards excited our interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a young lad of eighteen or nineteen, and his mother, a lady of
      about fifty, or it might be less. The mother wore a widow's weeds, and the
      boy was also clothed in deep mourning. They were poor-very poor; for their
      only means of support arose from the pittance the boy earned, by copying
      writings, and translating for booksellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had removed from some country place and settled in London; partly
      because it afforded better chances of employment for the boy, and partly,
      perhaps, with the natural desire to leave a place where they had been in
      better circumstances, and where their poverty was known. They were proud
      under their reverses, and above revealing their wants and privations to
      strangers. How bitter those privations were, and how hard the boy worked
      to remove them, no one ever knew but themselves. Night after night, two,
      three, four hours after midnight, could we hear the occasional raking up
      of the scanty fire, or the hollow and half-stifled cough, which indicated
      his being still at work; and day after day, could we see more plainly that
      nature had set that unearthly light in his plaintive face, which is the
      beacon of her worst disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actuated, we hope, by a higher feeling than mere curiosity, we contrived
      to establish, first an acquaintance, and then a close intimacy, with the
      poor strangers. Our worst fears were realised; the boy was sinking fast.
      Through a part of the winter, and the whole of the following spring and
      summer, his labours were unceasingly prolonged: and the mother attempted
      to procure needle-work, embroidery-anything for bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few shillings now and then, were all she could earn. The boy worked
      steadily on; dying by minutes, but never once giving utterance to
      complaint or murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      One beautiful autumn evening we went to pay our customary visit to the
      invalid. His little remaining strength had been decreasing rapidly for two
      or three days preceding, and he was lying on the sofa at the open window,
      gazing at the setting sun. His mother had been reading the Bible to him,
      for she closed the book as we entered, and advanced to meet us.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was telling William,' she said, 'that we must manage to take him into
      the country somewhere, so that he may get quite well. He is not ill, you
      know, but he is not very strong, and has exerted himself too much lately.'
      Poor thing! The tears that streamed through her fingers, as she turned
      aside, as if to adjust her close widow's cap, too plainly showed how
      fruitless was the attempt to deceive herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat down by the head of the sofa, but said nothing, for we saw the
      breath of life was passing gently but rapidly from the young form before
      us. At every respiration, his heart beat more slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy placed one hand in ours, grasped his mother's arm with the other,
      drew her hastily towards him, and fervently kissed her cheek. There was a
      pause. He sunk back upon his pillow, and looked long and earnestly in his
      mother's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'William, William!' murmured the mother, after a long interval, 'don't
      look at me so-speak to me, dear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy smiled languidly, but an instant afterwards his features resolved
      into the same cold, solemn gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      'William, dear William! rouse yourself; don't look at me so, love-pray
      don't! Oh, my God! what shall I do!' cried the widow, clasping her hands
      in agony-'my dear boy! he is dying!' The boy raised himself by a violent
      effort, and folded his hands together-'Mother! dear, dear mother, bury me
      in the open fields-anywhere but in these dreadful streets. I should like
      to be where you can see my grave, but not in these close crowded streets;
      they have killed me; kiss me again, mother; put your arm round my neck-'
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell back, and a strange expression stole upon his features; not of
      pain or suffering, but an indescribable fixing of every line and muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was dead.

      CHAPTER I-THE STREETS-MORNING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The appearance presented by the streets of London an hour before sunrise,
      on a summer's morning, is most striking even to the few whose unfortunate
      pursuits of pleasure, or scarcely less unfortunate pursuits of business,
      cause them to be well acquainted with the scene. There is an air of cold,
      solitary desolation about the noiseless streets which we are accustomed to
      see thronged at other times by a busy, eager crowd, and over the quiet,
      closely-shut buildings, which throughout the day are swarming with life
      and bustle, that is very impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last drunken man, who shall find his way home before sunlight, has
      just staggered heavily along, roaring out the burden of the drinking song
      of the previous night: the last houseless vagrant whom penury and police
      have left in the streets, has coiled up his chilly limbs in some paved
      comer, to dream of food and warmth. The drunken, the dissipated, and the
      wretched have disappeared; the more sober and orderly part of the
      population have not yet awakened to the labours of the day, and the
      stillness of death is over the streets; its very hue seems to be imparted
      to them, cold and lifeless as they look in the grey, sombre light of
      daybreak. The coach-stands in the larger thoroughfares are deserted: the
      night-houses are closed; and the chosen promenades of profligate misery
      are empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      An occasional policeman may alone be seen at the street corners,
      listlessly gazing on the deserted prospect before him; and now and then a
      rakish-looking cat runs stealthily across the road and descends his own
      area with as much caution and slyness-bounding first on the water- butt,
      then on the dust-hole, and then alighting on the flag-stones-as if he were
      conscious that his character depended on his gallantry of the preceding
      night escaping public observation. A partially opened bedroom-window here
      and there, bespeaks the heat of the weather, and the uneasy slumbers of
      its occupant; and the dim scanty flicker of the rushlight, through the
      window-blind, denotes the chamber of watching or sickness. With these few
      exceptions, the streets present no signs of life, nor the houses of
      habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour wears away; the spires of the churches and roofs of the principal
      buildings are faintly tinged with the light of the rising sun; and the
      streets, by almost imperceptible degrees, begin to resume their bustle and
      animation. Market-carts roll slowly along: the sleepy waggoner impatiently
      urging on his tired horses, or vainly endeavouring to awaken the boy, who,
      luxuriously stretched on the top of the fruit- baskets, forgets, in happy
      oblivion, his long-cherished curiosity to behold the wonders of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rough, sleepy-looking animals of strange appearance, something between
      ostlers and hackney-coachmen, begin to take down the shutters of early
      public-houses; and little deal tables, with the ordinary preparations for
      a street breakfast, make their appearance at the customary stations.
      Numbers of men and women (principally the latter), carrying upon their
      heads heavy baskets of fruit, toil down the park side of Piccadilly, on
      their way to Covent-garden, and, following each other in rapid succession,
      form a long straggling line from thence to the turn of the road at
      Knightsbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there, a bricklayer's labourer, with the day's dinner tied up in
      a handkerchief, walks briskly to his work, and occasionally a little knot
      of three or four schoolboys on a stolen bathing expedition rattle merrily
      over the pavement, their boisterous mirth contrasting forcibly with the
      demeanour of the little sweep, who, having knocked and rung till his arm
      aches, and being interdicted by a merciful legislature from endangering
      his lungs by calling out, sits patiently down on the door- step, until the
      housemaid may happen to awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covent-garden market, and the avenues leading to it, are thronged with
      carts of all sorts, sizes, and descriptions, from the heavy lumbering
      waggon, with its four stout horses, to the jingling costermonger's cart,
      with its consumptive donkey. The pavement is already strewed with decayed
      cabbage-leaves, broken hay-bands, and all the indescribable litter of a
      vegetable market; men are shouting, carts backing, horses neighing, boys
      fighting, basket-women talking, piemen expatiating on the excellence of
      their pastry, and donkeys braying. These and a hundred other sounds form a
      compound discordant enough to a Londoner's ears, and remarkably
      disagreeable to those of country gentlemen who are sleeping at the Hummums
      for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hour passes away, and the day begins in good earnest. The servant
      of all work, who, under the plea of sleeping very soundly, has utterly
      disregarded 'Missis's' ringing for half an hour previously, is warned by
      Master (whom Missis has sent up in his drapery to the landing- place for
      that purpose), that it's half-past six, whereupon she awakes all of a
      sudden, with well-feigned astonishment, and goes down-stairs very sulkily,
      wishing, while she strikes a light, that the principle of spontaneous
      combustion would extend itself to coals and kitchen range. When the fire
      is lighted, she opens the street-door to take in the milk, when, by the
      most singular coincidence in the world, she discovers that the servant
      next door has just taken in her milk too, and that Mr. Todd's young man
      over the way, is, by an equally extraordinary chance, taking down his
      master's shutters. The inevitable consequence is, that she just steps,
      milk-jug in hand, as far as next door, just to say 'good morning' to Betsy
      Clark, and that Mr. Todd's young man just steps over the way to say 'good
      morning' to both of 'em; and as the aforesaid Mr. Todd's young man is
      almost as good-looking and fascinating as the baker himself, the
      conversation quickly becomes very interesting, and probably would become
      more so, if Betsy Clark's Missis, who always will be a- followin' her
      about, didn't give an angry tap at her bedroom window, on which Mr. Todd's
      young man tries to whistle coolly, as he goes back to his shop much faster
      than he came from it; and the two girls run back to their respective
      places, and shut their street-doors with surprising softness, each of them
      poking their heads out of the front parlour window, a minute afterwards,
      however, ostensibly with the view of looking at the mail which just then
      passes by, but really for the purpose of catching another glimpse of Mr.
      Todd's young man, who being fond of mails, but more of females, takes a
      short look at the mails, and a long look at the girls, much to the
      satisfaction of all parties concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mail itself goes on to the coach-office in due course, and the
      passengers who are going out by the early coach, stare with astonishment
      at the passengers who are coming in by the early coach, who look blue and
      dismal, and are evidently under the influence of that odd feeling produced
      by travelling, which makes the events of yesterday morning seem as if they
      had happened at least six months ago, and induces people to wonder with
      considerable gravity whether the friends and relations they took leave of
      a fortnight before, have altered much since they have left them. The
      coach-office is all alive, and the coaches which are just going out, are
      surrounded by the usual crowd of Jews and nondescripts, who seem to
      consider, Heaven knows why, that it is quite impossible any man can mount
      a coach without requiring at least sixpenny-worth of oranges, a penknife,
      a pocket-book, a last year's annual, a pencil-case, a piece of sponge, and
      a small series of caricatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour more, and the sun darts his bright rays cheerfully down the
      still half-empty streets, and shines with sufficient force to rouse the
      dismal laziness of the apprentice, who pauses every other minute from his
      task of sweeping out the shop and watering the pavement in front of it, to
      tell another apprentice similarly employed, how hot it will be to-day, or
      to stand with his right hand shading his eyes, and his left resting on the
      broom, gazing at the 'Wonder,' or the 'Tally-ho,' or the 'Nimrod,' or some
      other fast coach, till it is out of sight, when he re- enters the shop,
      envying the passengers on the outside of the fast coach, and thinking of
      the old red brick house 'down in the country,' where he went to school:
      the miseries of the milk and water, and thick bread and scrapings, fading
      into nothing before the pleasant recollection of the green field the boys
      used to play in, and the green pond he was caned for presuming to fall
      into, and other schoolboy associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabs, with trunks and band-boxes between the drivers' legs and outside the
      apron, rattle briskly up and down the streets on their way to the
      coach-offices or steam-packet wharfs; and the cab-drivers and hackney-
      coachmen who are on the stand polish up the ornamental part of their dingy
      vehicles-the former wondering how people can prefer 'them wild beast
      cariwans of homnibuses, to a riglar cab with a fast trotter,' and the
      latter admiring how people can trust their necks into one of 'them crazy
      cabs, when they can have a 'spectable 'ackney cotche with a pair of 'orses
      as von't run away with no vun;' a consolation unquestionably founded on
      fact, seeing that a hackney-coach horse never was known to run at all,
      'except,' as the smart cabman in front of the rank observes, 'except one,
      and he run back'ards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The shops are now completely opened, and apprentices and shopmen are
      busily engaged in cleaning and decking the windows for the day. The
      bakers' shops in town are filled with servants and children waiting for
      the drawing of the first batch of rolls-an operation which was performed a
      full hour ago in the suburbs: for the early clerk population of Somers and
      Camden towns, Islington, and Pentonville, are fast pouring into the city,
      or directing their steps towards Chancery-lane and the Inns of Court.
      Middle-aged men, whose salaries have by no means increased in the same
      proportion as their families, plod steadily along, apparently with no
      object in view but the counting-house; knowing by sight almost everybody
      they meet or overtake, for they have seen them every morning (Sunday
      excepted) during the last twenty years, but speaking to no one. If they do
      happen to overtake a personal acquaintance, they just exchange a hurried
      salutation, and keep walking on either by his side, or in front of him, as
      his rate of walking may chance to be. As to stopping to shake hands, or to
      take the friend's arm, they seem to think that as it is not included in
      their salary, they have no right to do it. Small office lads in large
      hats, who are made men before they are boys, hurry along in pairs, with
      their first coat carefully brushed, and the white trousers of last Sunday
      plentifully besmeared with dust and ink. It evidently requires a
      considerable mental struggle to avoid investing part of the day's
      dinner-money in the purchase of the stale tarts so temptingly exposed in
      dusty tins at the pastry-cooks' doors; but a consciousness of their own
      importance and the receipt of seven shillings a-week, with the prospect of
      an early rise to eight, comes to their aid, and they accordingly put their
      hats a little more on one side, and look under the bonnets of all the
      milliners' and stay-makers' apprentices they meet-poor girls!-the hardest
      worked, the worst paid, and too often, the worst used class of the
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleven o'clock, and a new set of people fill the streets. The goods in the
      shop-windows are invitingly arranged; the shopmen in their white
      neckerchiefs and spruce coats, look as it they couldn't clean a window if
      their lives depended on it; the carts have disappeared from Covent-
      garden; the waggoners have returned, and the costermongers repaired to
      their ordinary 'beats' in the suburbs; clerks are at their offices, and
      gigs, cabs, omnibuses, and saddle-horses, are conveying their masters to
      the same destination. The streets are thronged with a vast concourse of
      people, gay and shabby, rich and poor, idle and industrious; and we come
      to the heat, bustle, and activity of Noon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II-THE STREETS-NIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      But the streets of London, to be beheld in the very height of their glory,
      should be seen on a dark, dull, murky winter's night, when there is just
      enough damp gently stealing down to make the pavement greasy, without
      cleansing it of any of its impurities; and when the heavy lazy mist, which
      hangs over every object, makes the gas-lamps look brighter, and the
      brilliantly-lighted shops more splendid, from the contrast they present to
      the darkness around. All the people who are at home on such a night as
      this, seem disposed to make themselves as snug and comfortable as
      possible; and the passengers in the streets have excellent reason to envy
      the fortunate individuals who are seated by their own firesides.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the larger and better kind of streets, dining parlour curtains are
      closely drawn, kitchen fires blaze brightly up, and savoury steams of hot
      dinners salute the nostrils of the hungry wayfarer, as he plods wearily by
      the area railings. In the suburbs, the muffin boy rings his way down the
      little street, much more slowly than he is wont to do; for Mrs. Macklin,
      of No. 4, has no sooner opened her little street-door, and screamed out
      'Muffins!' with all her might, than Mrs. Walker, at No. 5, puts her head
      out of the parlour-window, and screams 'Muffins!' too; and Mrs. Walker has
      scarcely got the words out of her lips, than Mrs. Peplow, over the way,
      lets loose Master Peplow, who darts down the street, with a velocity which
      nothing but buttered muffins in perspective could possibly inspire, and
      drags the boy back by main force, whereupon Mrs. Macklin and Mrs. Walker,
      just to save the boy trouble, and to say a few neighbourly words to Mrs.
      Peplow at the same time, run over the way and buy their muffins at Mrs.
      Peplow's door, when it appears from the voluntary statement of Mrs.
      Walker, that her 'kittle's jist a-biling, and the cups and sarsers ready
      laid,' and that, as it was such a wretched night out o' doors, she'd made
      up her mind to have a nice, hot, comfortable cup o' tea-a determination at
      which, by the most singular coincidence, the other two ladies had
      simultaneously arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little conversation about the wretchedness of the weather and the
      merits of tea, with a digression relative to the viciousness of boys as a
      rule, and the amiability of Master Peplow as an exception, Mrs. Walker
      sees her husband coming down the street; and as he must want his tea, poor
      man, after his dirty walk from the Docks, she instantly runs across,
      muffins in hand, and Mrs. Macklin does the same, and after a few words to
      Mrs. Walker, they all pop into their little houses, and slam their little
      street-doors, which are not opened again for the remainder of the evening,
      except to the nine o'clock 'beer,' who comes round with a lantern in front
      of his tray, and says, as he lends Mrs. Walker 'Yesterday's 'Tiser,' that
      he's blessed if he can hardly hold the pot, much less feel the paper, for
      it's one of the bitterest nights he ever felt, 'cept the night when the
      man was frozen to death in the Brick- field.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little prophetic conversation with the policeman at the street-
      corner, touching a probable change in the weather, and the setting-in of a
      hard frost, the nine o'clock beer returns to his master's house, and
      employs himself for the remainder of the evening, in assiduously stirring
      the tap-room fire, and deferentially taking part in the conversation of
      the worthies assembled round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets in the vicinity of the Marsh-gate and Victoria Theatre present
      an appearance of dirt and discomfort on such a night, which the groups who
      lounge about them in no degree tend to diminish. Even the little block-tin
      temple sacred to baked potatoes, surmounted by a splendid design in
      variegated lamps, looks less gay than usual, and as to the kidney-pie
      stand, its glory has quite departed. The candle in the transparent lamp,
      manufactured of oil-paper, embellished with 'characters,' has been blown
      out fifty times, so the kidney-pie merchant, tired with running backwards
      and forwards to the next wine- vaults, to get a light, has given up the
      idea of illumination in despair, and the only signs of his 'whereabout,'
      are the bright sparks, of which a long irregular train is whirled down the
      street every time he opens his portable oven to hand a hot kidney-pie to a
      customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flat-fish, oyster, and fruit vendors linger hopelessly in the kennel, in
      vain endeavouring to attract customers; and the ragged boys who usually
      disport themselves about the streets, stand crouched in little knots in
      some projecting doorway, or under the canvas blind of a cheesemonger's,
      where great flaring gas-lights, unshaded by any glass, display huge piles
      of blight red and pale yellow cheeses, mingled with little fivepenny dabs
      of dingy bacon, various tubs of weekly Dorset, and cloudy rolls of 'best
      fresh.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they amuse themselves with theatrical converse, arising out of their
      last half-price visit to the Victoria gallery, admire the terrific combat,
      which is nightly encored, and expatiate on the inimitable manner in which
      Bill Thompson can 'come the double monkey,' or go through the mysterious
      involutions of a sailor's hornpipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is nearly eleven o'clock, and the cold thin rain which has been
      drizzling so long, is beginning to pour down in good earnest; the baked-
      potato man has departed-the kidney-pie man has just walked away with his
      warehouse on his arm-the cheesemonger has drawn in his blind, and the boys
      have dispersed. The constant clicking of pattens on the slippy and uneven
      pavement, and the rustling of umbrellas, as the wind blows against the
      shop-windows, bear testimony to the inclemency of the night; and the
      policeman, with his oilskin cape buttoned closely round him, seems as he
      holds his hat on his head, and turns round to avoid the gust of wind and
      rain which drives against him at the street-corner, to be very far from
      congratulating himself on the prospect before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little chandler's shop with the cracked bell behind the door, whose
      melancholy tinkling has been regulated by the demand for quarterns of
      sugar and half-ounces of coffee, is shutting up. The crowds which have
      been passing to and fro during the whole day, are rapidly dwindling away;
      and the noise of shouting and quarrelling which issues from the
      public-houses, is almost the only sound that breaks the melancholy
      stillness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another, but it has ceased. That wretched woman with the infant
      in her arms, round whose meagre form the remnant of her own scanty shawl
      is carefully wrapped, has been attempting to sing some popular ballad, in
      the hope of wringing a few pence from the compassionate passer-by. A
      brutal laugh at her weak voice is all she has gained. The tears fall thick
      and fast down her own pale face; the child is cold and hungry, and its low
      half-stifled wailing adds to the misery of its wretched mother, as she
      moans aloud, and sinks despairingly down, on a cold damp door-step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Singing! How few of those who pass such a miserable creature as this,
      think of the anguish of heart, the sinking of soul and spirit, which the
      very effort of singing produces. Bitter mockery! Disease, neglect, and
      starvation, faintly articulating the words of the joyous ditty, that has
      enlivened your hours of feasting and merriment, God knows how often! It is
      no subject of jeering. The weak tremulous voice tells a fearful tale of
      want and famishing; and the feeble singer of this roaring song may turn
      away, only to die of cold and hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      One o'clock! Parties returning from the different theatres foot it through
      the muddy streets; cabs, hackney-coaches, carriages, and theatre
      omnibuses, roll swiftly by; watermen with dim dirty lanterns in their
      hands, and large brass plates upon their breasts, who have been shouting
      and rushing about for the last two hours, retire to their watering-
      houses, to solace themselves with the creature comforts of pipes and purl;
      the half-price pit and box frequenters of the theatres throng to the
      different houses of refreshment; and chops, kidneys, rabbits, oysters,
      stout, cigars, and 'goes' innumerable, are served up amidst a noise and
      confusion of smoking, running, knife-clattering, and waiter- chattering,
      perfectly indescribable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more musical portion of the play-going community betake themselves to
      some harmonic meeting. As a matter of curiosity let us follow them thither
      for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a lofty room of spacious dimensions, are seated some eighty or a
      hundred guests knocking little pewter measures on the tables, and
      hammering away, with the handles of their knives, as if they were so many
      trunk-makers. They are applauding a glee, which has just been executed by
      the three 'professional gentlemen' at the top of the centre table, one of
      whom is in the chair-the little pompous man with the bald head just
      emerging from the collar of his green coat. The others are seated on
      either side of him-the stout man with the small voice, and the thin-faced
      dark man in black. The little man in the chair is a most amusing
      personage,-such condescending grandeur, and such a voice!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bass!' as the young gentleman near us with the blue stock forcibly
      remarks to his companion, 'bass! I b'lieve you; he can go down lower than
      any man: so low sometimes that you can't hear him.' And so he does. To
      hear him growling away, gradually lower and lower down, till he can't get
      back again, is the most delightful thing in the world, and it is quite
      impossible to witness unmoved the impressive solemnity with which he pours
      forth his soul in 'My 'art's in the 'ighlands,' or 'The brave old Hoak.'
      The stout man is also addicted to sentimentality, and warbles 'Fly, fly
      from the world, my Bessy, with me,' or some such song, with lady-like
      sweetness, and in the most seductive tones imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray give your orders, gen'l'm'n-pray give your orders,'-says the pale-
      faced man with the red head; and demands for 'goes' of gin and 'goes' of
      brandy, and pints of stout, and cigars of peculiar mildness, are
      vociferously made from all parts of the room. The 'professional gentlemen'
      are in the very height of their glory, and bestow condescending nods, or
      even a word or two of recognition, on the better- known frequenters of the
      room, in the most bland and patronising manner possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little round-faced man, with the small brown surtout, white stockings
      and shoes, is in the comic line; the mixed air of self-denial, and mental
      consciousness of his own powers, with which he acknowledges the call of
      the chair, is particularly gratifying. 'Gen'l'men,' says the little
      pompous man, accompanying the word with a knock of the president's hammer
      on the table-'Gen'l'men, allow me to claim your attention-our friend, Mr.
      Smuggins, will oblige.'-'Bravo!' shout the company; and Smuggins, after a
      considerable quantity of coughing by way of symphony, and a most facetious
      sniff or two, which afford general delight, sings a comic song, with a
      fal-de-ral-tol-de-ral chorus at the end of every verse, much longer than
      the verse itself. It is received with unbounded applause, and after some
      aspiring genius has volunteered a recitation, and failed dismally therein,
      the little pompous man gives another knock, and says 'Gen'l'men, we will
      attempt a glee, if you please.' This announcement calls forth tumultuous
      applause, and the more energetic spirits express the unqualified
      approbation it affords them, by knocking one or two stout glasses off
      their legs-a humorous device; but one which frequently occasions some
      slight altercation when the form of paying the damage is proposed to be
      gone through by the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scenes like these are continued until three or four o'clock in the
      morning; and even when they close, fresh ones open to the inquisitive
      novice. But as a description of all of them, however slight, would require
      a volume, the contents of which, however instructive, would be by no means
      pleasing, we make our bow, and drop the curtain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III-SHOPS AND THEIR TENANTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      What inexhaustible food for speculation, do the streets of London afford!
      We never were able to agree with Sterne in pitying the man who could
      travel from Dan to Beersheba, and say that all was barren; we have not the
      slightest commiseration for the man who can take up his hat and stick, and
      walk from Covent-garden to St. Paul's Churchyard, and back into the
      bargain, without deriving some amusement-we had almost said
      instruction-from his perambulation. And yet there are such beings: we meet
      them every day. Large black stocks and light waistcoats, jet canes and
      discontented countenances, are the characteristics of the race; other
      people brush quickly by you, steadily plodding on to business, or
      cheerfully running after pleasure. These men linger listlessly past,
      looking as happy and animated as a policeman on duty. Nothing seems to
      make an impression on their minds: nothing short of being knocked down by
      a porter, or run over by a cab, will disturb their equanimity. You will
      meet them on a fine day in any of the leading thoroughfares: peep through
      the window of a west-end cigar shop in the evening, if you can manage to
      get a glimpse between the blue curtains which intercept the vulgar gaze,
      and you see them in their only enjoyment of existence. There they are
      lounging about, on round tubs and pipe boxes, in all the dignity of
      whiskers, and gilt watch-guards; whispering soft nothings to the young
      lady in amber, with the large ear-rings, who, as she sits behind the
      counter in a blaze of adoration and gas-light, is the admiration of all
      the female servants in the neighbourhood, and the envy of every milliner's
      apprentice within two miles round.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of our principal amusements is to watch the gradual progress-the rise
      or fall-of particular shops. We have formed an intimate acquaintance with
      several, in different parts of town, and are perfectly acquainted with
      their whole history. We could name off-hand, twenty at least, which we are
      quite sure have paid no taxes for the last six years. They are never
      inhabited for more than two months consecutively, and, we verily believe,
      have witnessed every retail trade in the directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one, whose history is a sample of the rest, in whose fate we have
      taken especial interest, having had the pleasure of knowing it ever since
      it has been a shop. It is on the Surrey side of the water-a little
      distance beyond the Marsh-gate. It was originally a substantial,
      good-looking private house enough; the landlord got into difficulties, the
      house got into Chancery, the tenant went away, and the house went to ruin.
      At this period our acquaintance with it commenced; the paint was all worn
      off; the windows were broken, the area was green with neglect and the
      overflowings of the water-butt; the butt itself was without a lid, and the
      street-door was the very picture of misery. The chief pastime of the
      children in the vicinity had been to assemble in a body on the steps, and
      to take it in turn to knock loud double knocks at the door, to the great
      satisfaction of the neighbours generally, and especially of the nervous
      old lady next door but one. Numerous complaints were made, and several
      small basins of water discharged over the offenders, but without effect.
      In this state of things, the marine- store dealer at the corner of the
      street, in the most obliging manner took the knocker off, and sold it: and
      the unfortunate house looked more wretched than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      We deserted our friend for a few weeks. What was our surprise, on our
      return, to find no trace of its existence! In its place was a handsome
      shop, fast approaching to a state of completion, and on the shutters were
      large bills, informing the public that it would shortly be opened with 'an
      extensive stock of linen-drapery and haberdashery.' It opened in due
      course; there was the name of the proprietor 'and Co.' in gilt letters,
      almost too dazzling to look at. Such ribbons and shawls! and two such
      elegant young men behind the counter, each in a clean collar and white
      neckcloth, like the lover in a farce. As to the proprietor, he did nothing
      but walk up and down the shop, and hand seats to the ladies, and hold
      important conversations with the handsomest of the young men, who was
      shrewdly suspected by the neighbours to be the 'Co.' We saw all this with
      sorrow; we felt a fatal presentiment that the shop was doomed-and so it
      was. Its decay was slow, but sure. Tickets gradually appeared in the
      windows; then rolls of flannel, with labels on them, were stuck outside
      the door; then a bill was pasted on the street- door, intimating that the
      first floor was to let unfurnished; then one of the young men disappeared
      altogether, and the other took to a black neckerchief, and the proprietor
      took to drinking. The shop became dirty, broken panes of glass remained
      unmended, and the stock disappeared piecemeal. At last the company's man
      came to cut off the water, and then the linen-draper cut off himself,
      leaving the landlord his compliments and the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next occupant was a fancy stationer. The shop was more modestly
      painted than before, still it was neat; but somehow we always thought, as
      we passed, that it looked like a poor and struggling concern. We wished
      the man well, but we trembled for his success. He was a widower evidently,
      and had employment elsewhere, for he passed us every morning on his road
      to the city. The business was carried on by his eldest daughter. Poor
      girl! she needed no assistance. We occasionally caught a glimpse of two or
      three children, in mourning like herself, as they sat in the little
      parlour behind the shop; and we never passed at night without seeing the
      eldest girl at work, either for them, or in making some elegant little
      trifle for sale. We often thought, as her pale face looked more sad and
      pensive in the dim candle-light, that if those thoughtless females who
      interfere with the miserable market of poor creatures such as these, knew
      but one-half of the misery they suffer, and the bitter privations they
      endure, in their honourable attempts to earn a scanty subsistence, they
      would, perhaps, resign even opportunities for the gratification of vanity,
      and an immodest love of self-display, rather than drive them to a last
      dreadful resource, which it would shock the delicate feelings of these
      charitable ladies to hear named.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are forgetting the shop. Well, we continued to watch it, and every
      day showed too clearly the increasing poverty of its inmates. The children
      were clean, it is true, but their clothes were threadbare and shabby; no
      tenant had been procured for the upper part of the house, from the letting
      of which, a portion of the means of paying the rent was to have been
      derived, and a slow, wasting consumption prevented the eldest girl from
      continuing her exertions. Quarter-day arrived. The landlord had suffered
      from the extravagance of his last tenant, and he had no compassion for the
      struggles of his successor; he put in an execution. As we passed one
      morning, the broker's men were removing the little furniture there was in
      the house, and a newly-posted bill informed us it was again 'To Let.' What
      became of the last tenant we never could learn; we believe the girl is
      past all suffering, and beyond all sorrow. God help her! We hope she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were somewhat curious to ascertain what would be the next stage-for
      that the place had no chance of succeeding now, was perfectly clear. The
      bill was soon taken down, and some alterations were being made in the
      interior of the shop. We were in a fever of expectation; we exhausted
      conjecture-we imagined all possible trades, none of which were perfectly
      reconcilable with our idea of the gradual decay of the tenement. It
      opened, and we wondered why we had not guessed at the real state of the
      case before. The shop-not a large one at the best of times-had been
      converted into two: one was a bonnet-shape maker's, the other was opened
      by a tobacconist, who also dealt in walking-sticks and Sunday newspapers;
      the two were separated by a thin partition, covered with tawdry striped
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tobacconist remained in possession longer than any tenant within our
      recollection. He was a red-faced, impudent, good-for-nothing dog,
      evidently accustomed to take things as they came, and to make the best of
      a bad job. He sold as many cigars as he could, and smoked the rest. He
      occupied the shop as long as he could make peace with the landlord, and
      when he could no longer live in quiet, he very coolly locked the door, and
      bolted himself. From this period, the two little dens have undergone
      innumerable changes. The tobacconist was succeeded by a theatrical
      hair-dresser, who ornamented the window with a great variety of
      'characters,' and terrific combats. The bonnet-shape maker gave place to a
      greengrocer, and the histrionic barber was succeeded, in his turn, by a
      tailor. So numerous have been the changes, that we have of late done
      little more than mark the peculiar but certain indications of a house
      being poorly inhabited. It has been progressing by almost imperceptible
      degrees. The occupiers of the shops have gradually given up room after
      room, until they have only reserved the little parlour for themselves.
      First there appeared a brass plate on the private door, with 'Ladies'
      School' legibly engraved thereon; shortly afterwards we observed a second
      brass plate, then a bell, and then another bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we paused in front of our old friend, and observed these signs of
      poverty, which are not to be mistaken, we thought as we turned away, that
      the house had attained its lowest pitch of degradation. We were wrong.
      When we last passed it, a 'dairy' was established in the area, and a party
      of melancholy-looking fowls were amusing themselves by running in at the
      front door, and out at the back one.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV-SCOTLAND-YARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scotland-yard is a small-a very small-tract of land, bounded on one side
      by the river Thames, on the other by the gardens of Northumberland House:
      abutting at one end on the bottom of Northumberland-street, at the other
      on the back of Whitehall-place. When this territory was first accidentally
      discovered by a country gentleman who lost his way in the Strand, some
      years ago, the original settlers were found to be a tailor, a publican,
      two eating-house keepers, and a fruit-pie maker; and it was also found to
      contain a race of strong and bulky men, who repaired to the wharfs in
      Scotland-yard regularly every morning, about five or six o'clock, to fill
      heavy waggons with coal, with which they proceeded to distant places up
      the country, and supplied the inhabitants with fuel. When they had emptied
      their waggons, they again returned for a fresh supply; and this trade was
      continued throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the settlers derived their subsistence from ministering to the wants of
      these primitive traders, the articles exposed for sale, and the places
      where they were sold, bore strong outward marks of being expressly adapted
      to their tastes and wishes. The tailor displayed in his window a
      Lilliputian pair of leather gaiters, and a diminutive round frock, while
      each doorpost was appropriately garnished with a model of a coal-sack. The
      two eating-house keepers exhibited joints of a magnitude, and puddings of
      a solidity, which coalheavers alone could appreciate; and the fruit-pie
      maker displayed on his well-scrubbed window-board large white compositions
      of flour and dripping, ornamented with pink stains, giving rich promise of
      the fruit within, which made their huge mouths water, as they lingered
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the choicest spot in all Scotland-yard was the old public-house in the
      corner. Here, in a dark wainscoted-room of ancient appearance, cheered by
      the glow of a mighty fire, and decorated with an enormous clock, whereof
      the face was white, and the figures black, sat the lusty coalheavers,
      quaffing large draughts of Barclay's best, and puffing forth volumes of
      smoke, which wreathed heavily above their heads, and involved the room in
      a thick dark cloud. From this apartment might their voices be heard on a
      winter's night, penetrating to the very bank of the river, as they shouted
      out some sturdy chorus, or roared forth the burden of a popular song;
      dwelling upon the last few words with a strength and length of emphasis
      which made the very roof tremble above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, too, would they tell old legends of what the Thames was in ancient
      times, when the Patent Shot Manufactory wasn't built, and Waterloo- bridge
      had never been thought of; and then they would shake their heads with
      portentous looks, to the deep edification of the rising generation of
      heavers, who crowded round them, and wondered where all this would end;
      whereat the tailor would take his pipe solemnly from his mouth, and say,
      how that he hoped it might end well, but he very much doubted whether it
      would or not, and couldn't rightly tell what to make of it-a mysterious
      expression of opinion, delivered with a semi-prophetic air, which never
      failed to elicit the fullest concurrence of the assembled company; and so
      they would go on drinking and wondering till ten o'clock came, and with it
      the tailor's wife to fetch him home, when the little party broke up, to
      meet again in the same room, and say and do precisely the same things, on
      the following evening at the same hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the barges that came up the river began to bring vague
      rumours to Scotland-yard of somebody in the city having been heard to say,
      that the Lord Mayor had threatened in so many words to pull down the old
      London-bridge, and build up a new one. At first these rumours were
      disregarded as idle tales, wholly destitute of foundation, for nobody in
      Scotland-yard doubted that if the Lord Mayor contemplated any such dark
      design, he would just be clapped up in the Tower for a week or two, and
      then killed off for high treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees, however, the reports grew stronger, and more frequent, and at
      last a barge, laden with numerous chaldrons of the best Wallsend, brought
      up the positive intelligence that several of the arches of the old bridge
      were stopped, and that preparations were actually in progress for
      constructing the new one. What an excitement was visible in the old
      tap-room on that memorable night! Each man looked into his neighbour's
      face, pale with alarm and astonishment, and read therein an echo of the
      sentiments which filled his own breast. The oldest heaver present proved
      to demonstration, that the moment the piers were removed, all the water in
      the Thames would run clean off, and leave a dry gully in its place. What
      was to become of the coal-barges-of the trade of Scotland- yard-of the
      very existence of its population? The tailor shook his head more sagely
      than usual, and grimly pointing to a knife on the table, bid them wait and
      see what happened. He said nothing-not he; but if the Lord Mayor didn't
      fall a victim to popular indignation, why he would be rather astonished;
      that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did wait; barge after barge arrived, and still no tidings of the
      assassination of the Lord Mayor. The first stone was laid: it was done by
      a Duke-the King's brother. Years passed away, and the bridge was opened by
      the King himself. In course of time, the piers were removed; and when the
      people in Scotland-yard got up next morning in the confident expectation
      of being able to step over to Pedlar's Acre without wetting the soles of
      their shoes, they found to their unspeakable astonishment that the water
      was just where it used to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      A result so different from that which they had anticipated from this first
      improvement, produced its full effect upon the inhabitants of
      Scotland-yard. One of the eating-house keepers began to court public
      opinion, and to look for customers among a new class of people. He covered
      his little dining-tables with white cloths, and got a painter's apprentice
      to inscribe something about hot joints from twelve to two, in one of the
      little panes of his shop-window. Improvement began to march with rapid
      strides to the very threshold of Scotland-yard. A new market sprung up at
      Hungerford, and the Police Commissioners established their office in
      Whitehall-place. The traffic in Scotland-yard increased; fresh Members
      were added to the House of Commons, the Metropolitan Representatives found
      it a near cut, and many other foot passengers followed their example.
    </p>
    <p>
      We marked the advance of civilisation, and beheld it with a sigh. The
      eating-house keeper who manfully resisted the innovation of table- cloths,
      was losing ground every day, as his opponent gained it, and a deadly feud
      sprung up between them. The genteel one no longer took his evening's pint
      in Scotland-yard, but drank gin and water at a 'parlour' in
      Parliament-street. The fruit-pie maker still continued to visit the old
      room, but he took to smoking cigars, and began to call himself a
      pastrycook, and to read the papers. The old heavers still assembled round
      the ancient fireplace, but their talk was mournful: and the loud song and
      the joyous shout were heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is Scotland-yard now? How have its old customs changed; and how
      has the ancient simplicity of its inhabitants faded away! The old
      tottering public-house is converted into a spacious and lofty 'wine-
      vaults;' gold leaf has been used in the construction of the letters which
      emblazon its exterior, and the poet's art has been called into
      requisition, to intimate that if you drink a certain description of ale,
      you must hold fast by the rail. The tailor exhibits in his window the
      pattern of a foreign-looking brown surtout, with silk buttons, a fur
      collar, and fur cuffs. He wears a stripe down the outside of each leg of
      his trousers: and we have detected his assistants (for he has assistants
      now) in the act of sitting on the shop-board in the same uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the other end of the little row of houses a boot-maker has established
      himself in a brick box, with the additional innovation of a first floor;
      and here he exposes for sale, boots-real Wellington boots-an article which
      a few years ago, none of the original inhabitants had ever seen or heard
      of. It was but the other day, that a dress-maker opened another little box
      in the middle of the row; and, when we thought that the spirit of change
      could produce no alteration beyond that, a jeweller appeared, and not
      content with exposing gilt rings and copper bracelets out of number, put
      up an announcement, which still sticks in his window, that 'ladies' ears
      may be pierced within.' The dress-maker employs a young lady who wears
      pockets in her apron; and the tailor informs the public that gentlemen may
      have their own materials made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst all this change, and restlessness, and innovation, there remains
      but one old man, who seems to mourn the downfall of this ancient place. He
      holds no converse with human kind, but, seated on a wooden bench at the
      angle of the wall which fronts the crossing from Whitehall-place, watches
      in silence the gambols of his sleek and well-fed dogs. He is the presiding
      genius of Scotland-yard. Years and years have rolled over his head; but,
      in fine weather or in foul, hot or cold, wet or dry, hail, rain, or snow,
      he is still in his accustomed spot. Misery and want are depicted in his
      countenance; his form is bent by age, his head is grey with length of
      trial, but there he sits from day to day, brooding over the past; and
      thither he will continue to drag his feeble limbs, until his eyes have
      closed upon Scotland-yard, and upon the world together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years hence, and the antiquary of another generation looking into
      some mouldy record of the strife and passions that agitated the world in
      these times, may glance his eye over the pages we have just filled: and
      not all his knowledge of the history of the past, not all his black-
      letter lore, or his skill in book-collecting, not all the dry studies of a
      long life, or the dusty volumes that have cost him a fortune, may help him
      to the whereabouts, either of Scotland-yard, or of any one of the
      landmarks we have mentioned in describing it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V-SEVEN DIALS
    </h2>
    <p>
      We have always been of opinion that if Tom King and the Frenchman had not
      immortalised Seven Dials, Seven Dials would have immortalised itself.
      Seven Dials! the region of song and poetry-first effusions, and last dying
      speeches: hallowed by the names of Catnach and of Pitts-names that will
      entwine themselves with costermongers, and barrel-organs, when penny
      magazines shall have superseded penny yards of song, and capital
      punishment be unknown!
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at the construction of the place. The Gordian knot was all very well
      in its way: so was the maze of Hampton Court: so is the maze at the Beulah
      Spa: so were the ties of stiff white neckcloths, when the difficulty of
      getting one on, was only to be equalled by the apparent impossibility of
      ever getting it off again. But what involutions can compare with those of
      Seven Dials? Where is there such another maze of streets, courts, lanes,
      and alleys? Where such a pure mixture of Englishmen and Irishmen, as in
      this complicated part of London? We boldly aver that we doubt the veracity
      of the legend to which we have adverted. We can suppose a man rash enough
      to inquire at random-at a house with lodgers too-for a Mr. Thompson, with
      all but the certainty before his eyes, of finding at least two or three
      Thompsons in any house of moderate dimensions; but a Frenchman-a Frenchman
      in Seven Dials! Pooh! He was an Irishman. Tom King's education had been
      neglected in his infancy, and as he couldn't understand half the man said,
      he took it for granted he was talking French.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger who finds himself in 'The Dials' for the first time, and
      stands Belzoni-like, at the entrance of seven obscure passages, uncertain
      which to take, will see enough around him to keep his curiosity and
      attention awake for no inconsiderable time. From the irregular square into
      which he has plunged, the streets and courts dart in all directions, until
      they are lost in the unwholesome vapour which hangs over the house-tops,
      and renders the dirty perspective uncertain and confined; and lounging at
      every corner, as if they came there to take a few gasps of such fresh air
      as has found its way so far, but is too much exhausted already, to be
      enabled to force itself into the narrow alleys around, are groups of
      people, whose appearance and dwellings would fill any mind but a regular
      Londoner's with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side, a little crowd has collected round a couple of ladies, who
      having imbibed the contents of various 'three-outs' of gin and bitters in
      the course of the morning, have at length differed on some point of
      domestic arrangement, and are on the eve of settling the quarrel
      satisfactorily, by an appeal to blows, greatly to the interest of other
      ladies who live in the same house, and tenements adjoining, and who are
      all partisans on one side or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Vy don't you pitch into her, Sarah?' exclaims one half-dressed matron, by
      way of encouragement. 'Vy don't you? if my 'usband had treated her with a
      drain last night, unbeknown to me, I'd tear her precious eyes out-a
      wixen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter, ma'am?' inquires another old woman, who has just
      bustled up to the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Matter!' replies the first speaker, talking at the obnoxious combatant,
      'matter! Here's poor dear Mrs. Sulliwin, as has five blessed children of
      her own, can't go out a charing for one arternoon, but what hussies must
      be a comin', and 'ticing avay her oun' 'usband, as she's been married to
      twelve year come next Easter Monday, for I see the certificate ven I vas a
      drinkin' a cup o' tea vith her, only the werry last blessed Ven'sday as
      ever was sent. I 'appen'd to say promiscuously, "Mrs. Sulliwin," says I-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean by hussies?' interrupts a champion of the other party,
      who has evinced a strong inclination throughout to get up a branch fight
      on her own account ('Hooroar,' ejaculates a pot-boy in parenthesis, 'put
      the kye-bosk on her, Mary!'), 'What do you mean by hussies?' reiterates
      the champion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Niver mind,' replies the opposition expressively, 'niver mind; you go
      home, and, ven you're quite sober, mend your stockings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This somewhat personal allusion, not only to the lady's habits of
      intemperance, but also to the state of her wardrobe, rouses her utmost
      ire, and she accordingly complies with the urgent request of the
      bystanders to 'pitch in,' with considerable alacrity. The scuffle became
      general, and terminates, in minor play-bill phraseology, with 'arrival of
      the policemen, interior of the station-house, and impressive dACnouement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the numerous groups who are idling about the gin-shops and
      squabbling in the centre of the road, every post in the open space has its
      occupant, who leans against it for hours, with listless perseverance. It
      is odd enough that one class of men in London appear to have no enjoyment
      beyond leaning against posts. We never saw a regular bricklayer's labourer
      take any other recreation, fighting excepted. Pass through St. Giles's in
      the evening of a week-day, there they are in their fustian dresses,
      spotted with brick-dust and whitewash, leaning against posts. Walk through
      Seven Dials on Sunday morning: there they are again, drab or light
      corduroy trousers, Blucher boots, blue coats, and great yellow waistcoats,
      leaning against posts. The idea of a man dressing himself in his best
      clothes, to lean against a post all day!
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar character of these streets, and the close resemblance each
      one bears to its neighbour, by no means tends to decrease the bewilderment
      in which the unexperienced wayfarer through 'the Dials' finds himself
      involved. He traverses streets of dirty, straggling houses, with now and
      then an unexpected court composed of buildings as ill-proportioned and
      deformed as the half-naked children that wallow in the kennels. Here and
      there, a little dark chandler's shop, with a cracked bell hung up behind
      the door to announce the entrance of a customer, or betray the presence of
      some young gentleman in whom a passion for shop tills has developed itself
      at an early age: others, as if for support, against some handsome lofty
      building, which usurps the place of a low dingy public-house; long rows of
      broken and patched windows expose plants that may have flourished when
      'the Dials' were built, in vessels as dirty as 'the Dials' themselves; and
      shops for the purchase of rags, bones, old iron, and kitchen-stuff, vie in
      cleanliness with the bird-fanciers and rabbit-dealers, which one might
      fancy so many arks, but for the irresistible conviction that no bird in
      its proper senses, who was permitted to leave one of them, would ever come
      back again. Brokers' shops, which would seem to have been established by
      humane individuals, as refuges for destitute bugs, interspersed with
      announcements of day-schools, penny theatres, petition-writers, mangles,
      and music for balls or routs, complete the 'still life' of the subject;
      and dirty men, filthy women, squalid children, fluttering shuttlecocks,
      noisy battledores, reeking pipes, bad fruit, more than doubtful oysters,
      attenuated cats, depressed dogs, and anatomical fowls, are its cheerful
      accompaniments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the external appearance of the houses, or a glance at their
      inhabitants, present but few attractions, a closer acquaintance with
      either is little calculated to alter one's first impression. Every room
      has its separate tenant, and every tenant is, by the same mysterious
      dispensation which causes a country curate to 'increase and multiply' most
      marvellously, generally the head of a numerous family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the shop, perhaps, is in the baked 'jemmy' line, or the fire-
      wood and hearth-stone line, or any other line which requires a floating
      capital of eighteen-pence or thereabouts: and he and his family live in
      the shop, and the small back parlour behind it. Then there is an Irish
      labourer and his family in the back kitchen, and a jobbing man-carpet-
      beater and so forth-with his family in the front one. In the front one-
      pair, there's another man with another wife and family, and in the back
      one-pair, there's 'a young 'oman as takes in tambour-work, and dresses
      quite genteel,' who talks a good deal about 'my friend,' and can't 'a-
      bear anything low.' The second floor front, and the rest of the lodgers,
      are just a second edition of the people below, except a shabby- genteel
      man in the back attic, who has his half-pint of coffee every morning from
      the coffee-shop next door but one, which boasts a little front den called
      a coffee-room, with a fireplace, over which is an inscription, politely
      requesting that, 'to prevent mistakes,' customers will 'please to pay on
      delivery.' The shabby-genteel man is an object of some mystery, but as he
      leads a life of seclusion, and never was known to buy anything beyond an
      occasional pen, except half-pints of coffee, penny loaves, and ha'porths
      of ink, his fellow-lodgers very naturally suppose him to be an author; and
      rumours are current in the Dials, that he writes poems for Mr. Warren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now anybody who passed through the Dials on a hot summer's evening, and
      saw the different women of the house gossiping on the steps, would be apt
      to think that all was harmony among them, and that a more primitive set of
      people than the native Diallers could not be imagined. Alas! the man in
      the shop ill-treats his family; the carpet-beater extends his professional
      pursuits to his wife; the one-pair front has an undying feud with the
      two-pair front, in consequence of the two-pair front persisting in dancing
      over his (the one-pair front's) head, when he and his family have retired
      for the night; the two-pair back will interfere with the front kitchen's
      children; the Irishman comes home drunk every other night, and attacks
      everybody; and the one-pair back screams at everything. Animosities spring
      up between floor and floor; the very cellar asserts his equality. Mrs. A.
      'smacks' Mrs. B.'s child for 'making faces.' Mrs. B. forthwith throws cold
      water over Mrs. A.'s child for 'calling names.' The husbands are
      embroiled-the quarrel becomes general-an assault is the consequence, and a
      police-officer the result.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI-MEDITATIONS IN MONMOUTH-STREET
    </h2>
    <p>
      We have always entertained a particular attachment towards Monmouth-
      street, as the only true and real emporium for second-hand wearing
      apparel. Monmouth-street is venerable from its antiquity, and respectable
      from its usefulness. Holywell-street we despise; the red- headed and
      red-whiskered Jews who forcibly haul you into their squalid houses, and
      thrust you into a suit of clothes, whether you will or not, we detest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inhabitants of Monmouth-street are a distinct class; a peaceable and
      retiring race, who immure themselves for the most part in deep cellars, or
      small back parlours, and who seldom come forth into the world, except in
      the dusk and coolness of the evening, when they may be seen seated, in
      chairs on the pavement, smoking their pipes, or watching the gambols of
      their engaging children as they revel in the gutter, a happy troop of
      infantine scavengers. Their countenances bear a thoughtful and a dirty
      cast, certain indications of their love of traffic; and their habitations
      are distinguished by that disregard of outward appearance and neglect of
      personal comfort, so common among people who are constantly immersed in
      profound speculations, and deeply engaged in sedentary pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have hinted at the antiquity of our favourite spot. 'A Monmouth- street
      laced coat' was a by-word a century ago; and still we find Monmouth-street
      the same. Pilot great-coats with wooden buttons, have usurped the place of
      the ponderous laced coats with full skirts; embroidered waistcoats with
      large flaps, have yielded to double-breasted checks with roll-collars; and
      three-cornered hats of quaint appearance, have given place to the low
      crowns and broad brims of the coachman school; but it is the times that
      have changed, not Monmouth-street. Through every alteration and every
      change, Monmouth-street has still remained the burial-place of the
      fashions; and such, to judge from all present appearances, it will remain
      until there are no more fashions to bury.
    </p>
    <p>
      We love to walk among these extensive groves of the illustrious dead, and
      to indulge in the speculations to which they give rise; now fitting a
      deceased coat, then a dead pair of trousers, and anon the mortal remains
      of a gaudy waistcoat, upon some being of our own conjuring up, and
      endeavouring, from the shape and fashion of the garment itself, to bring
      its former owner before our mind's eye. We have gone on speculating in
      this way, until whole rows of coats have started from their pegs, and
      buttoned up, of their own accord, round the waists of imaginary wearers;
      lines of trousers have jumped down to meet them; waistcoats have almost
      burst with anxiety to put themselves on; and half an acre of shoes have
      suddenly found feet to fit them, and gone stumping down the street with a
      noise which has fairly awakened us from our pleasant reverie, and driven
      us slowly away, with a bewildered stare, an object of astonishment to the
      good people of Monmouth-street, and of no slight suspicion to the
      policemen at the opposite street corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were occupied in this manner the other day, endeavouring to fit a pair
      of lace-up half-boots on an ideal personage, for whom, to say the truth,
      they were full a couple of sizes too small, when our eyes happened to
      alight on a few suits of clothes ranged outside a shop- window, which it
      immediately struck us, must at different periods have all belonged to, and
      been worn by, the same individual, and had now, by one of those strange
      conjunctions of circumstances which will occur sometimes, come to be
      exposed together for sale in the same shop. The idea seemed a fantastic
      one, and we looked at the clothes again with a firm determination not to
      be easily led away. No, we were right; the more we looked, the more we
      were convinced of the accuracy of our previous impression. There was the
      man's whole life written as legibly on those clothes, as if we had his
      autobiography engrossed on parchment before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first was a patched and much-soiled skeleton suit; one of those
      straight blue cloth cases in which small boys used to be confined, before
      belts and tunics had come in, and old notions had gone out: an ingenious
      contrivance for displaying the full symmetry of a boy's figure, by
      fastening him into a very tight jacket, with an ornamental row of buttons
      over each shoulder, and then buttoning his trousers over it, so as to give
      his legs the appearance of being hooked on, just under the armpits. This
      was the boy's dress. It had belonged to a town boy, we could see; there
      was a shortness about the legs and arms of the suit; and a bagging at the
      knees, peculiar to the rising youth of London streets. A small day-school
      he had been at, evidently. If it had been a regular boys' school they
      wouldn't have let him play on the floor so much, and rub his knees so
      white. He had an indulgent mother too, and plenty of halfpence, as the
      numerous smears of some sticky substance about the pockets, and just below
      the chin, which even the salesman's skill could not succeed in disguising,
      sufficiently betokened. They were decent people, but not overburdened with
      riches, or he would not have so far outgrown the suit when he passed into
      those corduroys with the round jacket; in which he went to a boys' school,
      however, and learnt to write-and in ink of pretty tolerable blackness,
      too, if the place where he used to wipe his pen might be taken as
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A black suit and the jacket changed into a diminutive coat. His father had
      died, and the mother had got the boy a message-lad's place in some office.
      A long-worn suit that one; rusty and threadbare before it was laid aside,
      but clean and free from soil to the last. Poor woman! We could imagine her
      assumed cheerfulness over the scanty meal, and the refusal of her own
      small portion, that her hungry boy might have enough. Her constant anxiety
      for his welfare, her pride in his growth mingled sometimes with the
      thought, almost too acute to bear, that as he grew to be a man his old
      affection might cool, old kindnesses fade from his mind, and old promises
      be forgotten-the sharp pain that even then a careless word or a cold look
      would give her-all crowded on our thoughts as vividly as if the very scene
      were passing before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things happen every hour, and we all know it; and yet we felt as
      much sorrow when we saw, or fancied we saw-it makes no difference
      which-the change that began to take place now, as if we had just conceived
      the bare possibility of such a thing for the first time. The next suit,
      smart but slovenly; meant to be gay, and yet not half so decent as the
      threadbare apparel; redolent of the idle lounge, and the blackguard
      companions, told us, we thought, that the widow's comfort had rapidly
      faded away. We could imagine that coat-imagine! we could see it; we had
      seen it a hundred times-sauntering in company with three or four other
      coats of the same cut, about some place of profligate resort at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dressed, from the same shop-window in an instant, half a dozen boys of
      from fifteen to twenty; and putting cigars into their mouths, and their
      hands into their pockets, watched them as they sauntered down the street,
      and lingered at the corner, with the obscene jest, and the oft- repeated
      oath. We never lost sight of them, till they had cocked their hats a
      little more on one side, and swaggered into the public-house; and then we
      entered the desolate home, where the mother sat late in the night, alone;
      we watched her, as she paced the room in feverish anxiety, and every now
      and then opened the door, looked wistfully into the dark and empty street,
      and again returned, to be again and again disappointed. We beheld the look
      of patience with which she bore the brutish threat, nay, even the drunken
      blow; and we heard the agony of tears that gushed from her very heart, as
      she sank upon her knees in her solitary and wretched apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long period had elapsed, and a greater change had taken place, by the
      time of casting off the suit that hung above. It was that of a stout,
      broad-shouldered, sturdy-chested man; and we knew at once, as anybody
      would, who glanced at that broad-skirted green coat, with the large metal
      buttons, that its wearer seldom walked forth without a dog at his heels,
      and some idle ruffian, the very counterpart of himself, at his side. The
      vices of the boy had grown with the man, and we fancied his home then-if
      such a place deserve the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw the bare and miserable room, destitute of furniture, crowded with
      his wife and children, pale, hungry, and emaciated; the man cursing their
      lamentations, staggering to the tap-room, from whence he had just
      returned, followed by his wife and a sickly infant, clamouring for bread;
      and heard the street-wrangle and noisy recrimination that his striking her
      occasioned. And then imagination led us to some metropolitan workhouse,
      situated in the midst of crowded streets and alleys, filled with noxious
      vapours, and ringing with boisterous cries, where an old and feeble woman,
      imploring pardon for her son, lay dying in a close dark room, with no
      child to clasp her hand, and no pure air from heaven to fan her brow. A
      stranger closed the eyes that settled into a cold unmeaning glare, and
      strange ears received the words that murmured from the white and
      half-closed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A coarse round frock, with a worn cotton neckerchief, and other articles
      of clothing of the commonest description, completed the history. A prison,
      and the sentence-banishment or the gallows. What would the man have given
      then, to be once again the contented humble drudge of his boyish years; to
      have been restored to life, but for a week, a day, an hour, a minute, only
      for so long a time as would enable him to say one word of passionate
      regret to, and hear one sound of heartfelt forgiveness from, the cold and
      ghastly form that lay rotting in the pauper's grave! The children wild in
      the streets, the mother a destitute widow; both deeply tainted with the
      deep disgrace of the husband and father's name, and impelled by sheer
      necessity, down the precipice that had led him to a lingering death,
      possibly of many years' duration, thousands of miles away. We had no clue
      to the end of the tale; but it was easy to guess its termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      We took a step or two further on, and by way of restoring the naturally
      cheerful tone of our thoughts, began fitting visionary feet and legs into
      a cellar-board full of boots and shoes, with a speed and accuracy that
      would have astonished the most expert artist in leather, living. There was
      one pair of boots in particular-a jolly, good-tempered, hearty-looking
      pair of tops, that excited our warmest regard; and we had got a fine,
      red-faced, jovial fellow of a market-gardener into them, before we had
      made their acquaintance half a minute. They were just the very thing for
      him. There was his huge fat legs bulging over the tops, and fitting them
      too tight to admit of his tucking in the loops he had pulled them on by;
      and his knee-cords with an interval of stocking; and his blue apron tucked
      up round his waist; and his red neckerchief and blue coat, and a white hat
      stuck on one side of his head; and there he stood with a broad grin on his
      great red face, whistling away, as if any other idea but that of being
      happy and comfortable had never entered his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the very man after our own heart; we knew all about him; we had
      seen him coming up to Covent-garden in his green chaise-cart, with the
      fat, tubby little horse, half a thousand times; and even while we cast an
      affectionate look upon his boots, at that instant, the form of a
      coquettish servant-maid suddenly sprung into a pair of Denmark satin shoes
      that stood beside them, and we at once recognised the very girl who
      accepted his offer of a ride, just on this side the Hammersmith
      suspension-bridge, the very last Tuesday morning we rode into town from
      Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very smart female, in a showy bonnet, stepped into a pair of grey cloth
      boots, with black fringe and binding, that were studiously pointing out
      their toes on the other side of the top-boots, and seemed very anxious to
      engage his attention, but we didn't observe that our friend the
      market-gardener appeared at all captivated with these blandishments; for
      beyond giving a knowing wink when they first began, as if to imply that he
      quite understood their end and object, he took no further notice of them.
      His indifference, however, was amply recompensed by the excessive
      gallantry of a very old gentleman with a silver-headed stick, who tottered
      into a pair of large list shoes, that were standing in one corner of the
      board, and indulged in a variety of gestures expressive of his admiration
      of the lady in the cloth boots, to the immeasurable amusement of a young
      fellow we put into a pair of long- quartered pumps, who we thought would
      have split the coat that slid down to meet him, with laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been looking on at this little pantomime with great satisfaction
      for some time, when, to our unspeakable astonishment, we perceived that
      the whole of the characters, including a numerous corps de ballet of boots
      and shoes in the background, into which we had been hastily thrusting as
      many feet as we could press into the service, were arranging themselves in
      order for dancing; and some music striking up at the moment, to it they
      went without delay. It was perfectly delightful to witness the agility of
      the market-gardener. Out went the boots, first on one side, then on the
      other, then cutting, then shuffling, then setting to the Denmark satins,
      then advancing, then retreating, then going round, and then repeating the
      whole of the evolutions again, without appearing to suffer in the least
      from the violence of the exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were the Denmark satins a bit behindhand, for they jumped and bounded
      about, in all directions; and though they were neither so regular, nor so
      true to the time as the cloth boots, still, as they seemed to do it from
      the heart, and to enjoy it more, we candidly confess that we preferred
      their style of dancing to the other. But the old gentleman in the list
      shoes was the most amusing object in the whole party; for, besides his
      grotesque attempts to appear youthful, and amorous, which were
      sufficiently entertaining in themselves, the young fellow in the pumps
      managed so artfully that every time the old gentleman advanced to salute
      the lady in the cloth boots, he trod with his whole weight on the old
      fellow's toes, which made him roar with anguish, and rendered all the
      others like to die of laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in the full enjoyment of these festivities when we heard a shrill,
      and by no means musical voice, exclaim, 'Hope you'll know me agin,
      imperence!' and on looking intently forward to see from whence the sound
      came, we found that it proceeded, not from the young lady in the cloth
      boots, as we had at first been inclined to suppose, but from a bulky lady
      of elderly appearance who was seated in a chair at the head of the
      cellar-steps, apparently for the purpose of superintending the sale of the
      articles arranged there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A barrel-organ, which had been in full force close behind us, ceased
      playing; the people we had been fitting into the shoes and boots took to
      flight at the interruption; and as we were conscious that in the depth of
      our meditations we might have been rudely staring at the old lady for half
      an hour without knowing it, we took to flight too, and were soon immersed
      in the deepest obscurity of the adjacent 'Dials.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII-HACKNEY-COACH STANDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      We maintain that hackney-coaches, properly so called, belong solely to the
      metropolis. We may be told, that there are hackney-coach stands in
      Edinburgh; and not to go quite so far for a contradiction to our position,
      we may be reminded that Liverpool, Manchester, 'and other large towns' (as
      the Parliamentary phrase goes), have their hackney- coach stands. We
      readily concede to these places the possession of certain vehicles, which
      may look almost as dirty, and even go almost as slowly, as London
      hackney-coaches; but that they have the slightest claim to compete with
      the metropolis, either in point of stands, drivers, or cattle, we
      indignantly deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a regular, ponderous, rickety, London hackney-coach of the old
      school, and let any man have the boldness to assert, if he can, that he
      ever beheld any object on the face of the earth which at all resembles it,
      unless, indeed, it were another hackney-coach of the same date. We have
      recently observed on certain stands, and we say it with deep regret,
      rather dapper green chariots, and coaches of polished yellow, with four
      wheels of the same colour as the coach, whereas it is perfectly notorious
      to every one who has studied the subject, that every wheel ought to be of
      a different colour, and a different size. These are innovations, and, like
      other miscalled improvements, awful signs of the restlessness of the
      public mind, and the little respect paid to our time-honoured
      institutions. Why should hackney-coaches be clean? Our ancestors found
      them dirty, and left them so. Why should we, with a feverish wish to 'keep
      moving,' desire to roll along at the rate of six miles an hour, while they
      were content to rumble over the stones at four? These are solemn
      considerations. Hackney-coaches are part and parcel of the law of the
      land; they were settled by the Legislature; plated and numbered by the
      wisdom of Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why have they been swamped by cabs and omnibuses? Or why should
      people be allowed to ride quickly for eightpence a mile, after Parliament
      had come to the solemn decision that they should pay a shilling a mile for
      riding slowly? We pause for a reply;-and, having no chance of getting one,
      begin a fresh paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our acquaintance with hackney-coach stands is of long standing. We are a
      walking book of fares, feeling ourselves, half bound, as it were, to be
      always in the right on contested points. We know all the regular watermen
      within three miles of Covent-garden by sight, and should be almost tempted
      to believe that all the hackney-coach horses in that district knew us by
      sight too, if one-half of them were not blind. We take great interest in
      hackney-coaches, but we seldom drive, having a knack of turning ourselves
      over when we attempt to do so. We are as great friends to horses,
      hackney-coach and otherwise, as the renowned Mr. Martin, of costermonger
      notoriety, and yet we never ride. We keep no horse, but a clothes-horse;
      enjoy no saddle so much as a saddle of mutton; and, following our own
      inclinations, have never followed the hounds. Leaving these fleeter means
      of getting over the ground, or of depositing oneself upon it, to those who
      like them, by hackney-coach stands we take our stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a hackney-coach stand under the very window at which we are
      writing; there is only one coach on it now, but it is a fair specimen of
      the class of vehicles to which we have alluded-a great, lumbering, square
      concern of a dingy yellow colour (like a bilious brunette), with very
      small glasses, but very large frames; the panels are ornamented with a
      faded coat of arms, in shape something like a dissected bat, the axletree
      is red, and the majority of the wheels are green. The box is partially
      covered by an old great-coat, with a multiplicity of capes, and some
      extraordinary-looking clothes; and the straw, with which the canvas
      cushion is stuffed, is sticking up in several places, as if in rivalry of
      the hay, which is peeping through the chinks in the boot. The horses, with
      drooping heads, and each with a mane and tail as scanty and straggling as
      those of a worn-out rocking-horse, are standing patiently on some damp
      straw, occasionally wincing, and rattling the harness; and now and then,
      one of them lifts his mouth to the ear of his companion, as if he were
      saying, in a whisper, that he should like to assassinate the coachman. The
      coachman himself is in the watering- house; and the waterman, with his
      hands forced into his pockets as far as they can possibly go, is dancing
      the 'double shuffle,' in front of the pump, to keep his feet warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant-girl, with the pink ribbons, at No. 5, opposite, suddenly
      opens the street-door, and four small children forthwith rush out, and
      scream 'Coach!' with all their might and main. The waterman darts from the
      pump, seizes the horses by their respective bridles, and drags them, and
      the coach too, round to the house, shouting all the time for the coachman
      at the very top, or rather very bottom of his voice, for it is a deep bass
      growl. A response is heard from the tap-room; the coachman, in his
      wooden-soled shoes, makes the street echo again as he runs across it; and
      then there is such a struggling, and backing, and grating of the kennel,
      to get the coach-door opposite the house-door, that the children are in
      perfect ecstasies of delight. What a commotion! The old lady, who has been
      stopping there for the last month, is going back to the country. Out comes
      box after box, and one side of the vehicle is filled with luggage in no
      time; the children get into everybody's way, and the youngest, who has
      upset himself in his attempts to carry an umbrella, is borne off wounded
      and kicking. The youngsters disappear, and a short pause ensues, during
      which the old lady is, no doubt, kissing them all round in the back
      parlour. She appears at last, followed by her married daughter, all the
      children, and both the servants, who, with the joint assistance of the
      coachman and waterman, manage to get her safely into the coach. A cloak is
      handed in, and a little basket, which we could almost swear contains a
      small black bottle, and a paper of sandwiches. Up go the steps, bang goes
      the door, 'Golden-cross, Charing-cross, Tom,' says the waterman;
      'Good-bye, grandma,' cry the children, off jingles the coach at the rate
      of three miles an hour, and the mamma and children retire into the house,
      with the exception of one little villain, who runs up the street at the
      top of his speed, pursued by the servant; not ill-pleased to have such an
      opportunity of displaying her attractions. She brings him back, and, after
      casting two or three gracious glances across the way, which are either
      intended for us or the potboy (we are not quite certain which), shuts the
      door, and the hackney-coach stand is again at a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been frequently amused with the intense delight with which 'a
      servant of all work,' who is sent for a coach, deposits herself inside;
      and the unspeakable gratification which boys, who have been despatched on
      a similar errand, appear to derive from mounting the box. But we never
      recollect to have been more amused with a hackney-coach party, than one we
      saw early the other morning in Tottenham-court-road. It was a
      wedding-party, and emerged from one of the inferior streets near
      Fitzroy-square. There were the bride, with a thin white dress, and a great
      red face; and the bridesmaid, a little, dumpy, good-humoured young woman,
      dressed, of course, in the same appropriate costume; and the bridegroom
      and his chosen friend, in blue coats, yellow waist-coats, white trousers,
      and Berlin gloves to match. They stopped at the corner of the street, and
      called a coach with an air of indescribable dignity. The moment they were
      in, the bridesmaid threw a red shawl, which she had, no doubt, brought on
      purpose, negligently over the number on the door, evidently to delude
      pedestrians into the belief that the hackney- coach was a private
      carriage; and away they went, perfectly satisfied that the imposition was
      successful, and quite unconscious that there was a great staring number
      stuck up behind, on a plate as large as a schoolboy's slate. A shilling a
      mile!-the ride was worth five, at least, to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an interesting book a hackney-coach might produce, if it could carry
      as much in its head as it does in its body! The autobiography of a
      broken-down hackney-coach, would surely be as amusing as the autobiography
      of a broken-down hackneyed dramatist; and it might tell as much of its
      travels with the pole, as others have of their expeditions to it. How many
      stories might be related of the different people it had conveyed on
      matters of business or profit-pleasure or pain! And how many melancholy
      tales of the same people at different periods! The country-girl-the showy,
      over-dressed woman-the drunken prostitute! The raw apprentice-the
      dissipated spendthrift-the thief!
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk of cabs! Cabs are all very well in cases of expedition, when it's a
      matter of neck or nothing, life or death, your temporary home or your long
      one. But, besides a cab's lacking that gravity of deportment which so
      peculiarly distinguishes a hackney-coach, let it never be forgotten that a
      cab is a thing of yesterday, and that he never was anything better. A
      hackney-cab has always been a hackney-cab, from his first entry into life;
      whereas a hackney-coach is a remnant of past gentility, a victim to
      fashion, a hanger-on of an old English family, wearing their arms, and, in
      days of yore, escorted by men wearing their livery, stripped of his
      finery, and thrown upon the world, like a once-smart footman when he is no
      longer sufficiently juvenile for his office, progressing lower and lower
      in the scale of four-wheeled degradation, until at last it comes to-a
      stand!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII-DOCTORS' COMMONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Walking without any definite object through St. Paul's Churchyard, a
      little while ago, we happened to turn down a street entitled 'Paul's-
      chain,' and keeping straight forward for a few hundred yards, found
      ourself, as a natural consequence, in Doctors' Commons. Now Doctors'
      Commons being familiar by name to everybody, as the place where they grant
      marriage-licenses to love-sick couples, and divorces to unfaithful ones;
      register the wills of people who have any property to leave, and punish
      hasty gentlemen who call ladies by unpleasant names, we no sooner
      discovered that we were really within its precincts, than we felt a
      laudable desire to become better acquainted therewith; and as the first
      object of our curiosity was the Court, whose decrees can even unloose the
      bonds of matrimony, we procured a direction to it; and bent our steps
      thither without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing a quiet and shady court-yard, paved with stone, and frowned upon
      by old red brick houses, on the doors of which were painted the names of
      sundry learned civilians, we paused before a small, green- baized,
      brass-headed-nailed door, which yielding to our gentle push, at once
      admitted us into an old quaint-looking apartment, with sunken windows, and
      black carved wainscoting, at the upper end of which, seated on a raised
      platform, of semicircular shape, were about a dozen solemn- looking
      gentlemen, in crimson gowns and wigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a more elevated desk in the centre, sat a very fat and red-faced
      gentleman, in tortoise-shell spectacles, whose dignified appearance
      announced the judge; and round a long green-baized table below, something
      like a billiard-table without the cushions and pockets, were a number of
      very self-important-looking personages, in stiff neckcloths, and black
      gowns with white fur collars, whom we at once set down as proctors. At the
      lower end of the billiard-table was an individual in an arm-chair, and a
      wig, whom we afterwards discovered to be the registrar; and seated behind
      a little desk, near the door, were a respectable-looking man in black, of
      about twenty-stone weight or thereabouts, and a fat-faced, smirking,
      civil-looking body, in a black gown, black kid gloves, knee shorts, and
      silks, with a shirt-frill in his bosom, curls on his head, and a silver
      staff in his hand, whom we had no difficulty in recognising as the officer
      of the Court. The latter, indeed, speedily set our mind at rest upon this
      point, for, advancing to our elbow, and opening a conversation forthwith,
      he had communicated to us, in less than five minutes, that he was the
      apparitor, and the other the court-keeper; that this was the Arches Court,
      and therefore the counsel wore red gowns, and the proctors fur collars;
      and that when the other Courts sat there, they didn't wear red gowns or
      fur collars either; with many other scraps of intelligence equally
      interesting. Besides these two officers, there was a little thin old man,
      with long grizzly hair, crouched in a remote corner, whose duty, our
      communicative friend informed us, was to ring a large hand- bell when the
      Court opened in the morning, and who, for aught his appearance betokened
      to the contrary, might have been similarly employed for the last two
      centuries at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-faced gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles had got all the
      talk to himself just then, and very well he was doing it, too, only he
      spoke very fast, but that was habit; and rather thick, but that was good
      living. So we had plenty of time to look about us. There was one
      individual who amused us mightily. This was one of the bewigged gentlemen
      in the red robes, who was straddling before the fire in the centre of the
      Court, in the attitude of the brazen Colossus, to the complete exclusion
      of everybody else. He had gathered up his robe behind, in much the same
      manner as a slovenly woman would her petticoats on a very dirty day, in
      order that he might feel the full warmth of the fire. His wig was put on
      all awry, with the tail straggling about his neck; his scanty grey
      trousers and short black gaiters, made in the worst possible style,
      imported an additional inelegant appearance to his uncouth person; and his
      limp, badly-starched shirt-collar almost obscured his eyes. We shall never
      be able to claim any credit as a physiognomist again, for, after a careful
      scrutiny of this gentleman's countenance, we had come to the conclusion
      that it bespoke nothing but conceit and silliness, when our friend with
      the silver staff whispered in our ear that he was no other than a doctor
      of civil law, and heaven knows what besides. So of course we were
      mistaken, and he must be a very talented man. He conceals it so well
      though-perhaps with the merciful view of not astonishing ordinary people
      too much-that you would suppose him to be one of the stupidest dogs alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman in the spectacles having concluded his judgment, and a few
      minutes having been allowed to elapse, to afford time for the buzz of the
      Court to subside, the registrar called on the next cause, which was 'the
      office of the Judge promoted by Bumple against Sludberry.' A general
      movement was visible in the Court, at this announcement, and the obliging
      functionary with silver staff whispered us that 'there would be some fun
      now, for this was a brawling case.'
    </p>
    <p>
      We were not rendered much the wiser by this piece of information, till we
      found by the opening speech of the counsel for the promoter, that, under a
      half-obsolete statute of one of the Edwards, the court was empowered to
      visit with the penalty of excommunication, any person who should be proved
      guilty of the crime of 'brawling,' or 'smiting,' in any church, or vestry
      adjoining thereto; and it appeared, by some eight-and- twenty affidavits,
      which were duly referred to, that on a certain night, at a certain
      vestry-meeting, in a certain parish particularly set forth, Thomas
      Sludberry, the party appeared against in that suit, had made use of, and
      applied to Michael Bumple, the promoter, the words 'You be blowed;' and
      that, on the said Michael Bumple and others remonstrating with the said
      Thomas Sludberry, on the impropriety of his conduct, the said Thomas
      Sludberry repeated the aforesaid expression, 'You be blowed;' and
      furthermore desired and requested to know, whether the said Michael Bumple
      'wanted anything for himself;' adding, 'that if the said Michael Bumple
      did want anything for himself, he, the said Thomas Sludberry, was the man
      to give it him;' at the same time making use of other heinous and sinful
      expressions, all of which, Bumple submitted, came within the intent and
      meaning of the Act; and therefore he, for the soul's health and chastening
      of Sludberry, prayed for sentence of excommunication against him
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon these facts a long argument was entered into, on both sides, to the
      great edification of a number of persons interested in the parochial
      squabbles, who crowded the court; and when some very long and grave
      speeches had been made pro and con, the red-faced gentleman in the
      tortoise-shell spectacles took a review of the case, which occupied half
      an hour more, and then pronounced upon Sludberry the awful sentence of
      excommunication for a fortnight, and payment of the costs of the suit.
      Upon this, Sludberry, who was a little, red-faced, sly-looking, ginger-
      beer seller, addressed the court, and said, if they'd be good enough to
      take off the costs, and excommunicate him for the term of his natural life
      instead, it would be much more convenient to him, for he never went to
      church at all. To this appeal the gentleman in the spectacles made no
      other reply than a look of virtuous indignation; and Sludberry and his
      friends retired. As the man with the silver staff informed us that the
      court was on the point of rising, we retired too-pondering, as we walked
      away, upon the beautiful spirit of these ancient ecclesiastical laws, the
      kind and neighbourly feelings they are calculated to awaken, and the
      strong attachment to religious institutions which they cannot fail to
      engender.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were so lost in these meditations, that we had turned into the street,
      and run up against a door-post, before we recollected where we were
      walking. On looking upwards to see what house we had stumbled upon, the
      words 'Prerogative-Office,' written in large characters, met our eye; and
      as we were in a sight-seeing humour and the place was a public one, we
      walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room into which we walked, was a long, busy-looking place, partitioned
      off, on either side, into a variety of little boxes, in which a few clerks
      were engaged in copying or examining deeds. Down the centre of the room
      were several desks nearly breast high, at each of which, three or four
      people were standing, poring over large volumes. As we knew that they were
      searching for wills, they attracted our attention at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious to contrast the lazy indifference of the attorneys' clerks
      who were making a search for some legal purpose, with the air of
      earnestness and interest which distinguished the strangers to the place,
      who were looking up the will of some deceased relative; the former pausing
      every now and then with an impatient yawn, or raising their heads to look
      at the people who passed up and down the room; the latter stooping over
      the book, and running down column after column of names in the deepest
      abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one little dirty-faced man in a blue apron, who after a whole
      morning's search, extending some fifty years back, had just found the will
      to which he wished to refer, which one of the officials was reading to him
      in a low hurried voice from a thick vellum book with large clasps. It was
      perfectly evident that the more the clerk read, the less the man with the
      blue apron understood about the matter. When the volume was first brought
      down, he took off his hat, smoothed down his hair, smiled with great
      self-satisfaction, and looked up in the reader's face with the air of a
      man who had made up his mind to recollect every word he heard. The first
      two or three lines were intelligible enough; but then the technicalities
      began, and the little man began to look rather dubious. Then came a whole
      string of complicated trusts, and he was regularly at sea. As the reader
      proceeded, it was quite apparent that it was a hopeless case, and the
      little man, with his mouth open and his eyes fixed upon his face, looked
      on with an expression of bewilderment and perplexity irresistibly
      ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little further on, a hard-featured old man with a deeply-wrinkled face,
      was intently perusing a lengthy will with the aid of a pair of horn
      spectacles: occasionally pausing from his task, and slily noting down some
      brief memorandum of the bequests contained in it. Every wrinkle about his
      toothless mouth, and sharp keen eyes, told of avarice and cunning. His
      clothes were nearly threadbare, but it was easy to see that he wore them
      from choice and not from necessity; all his looks and gestures down to the
      very small pinches of snuff which he every now and then took from a little
      tin canister, told of wealth, and penury, and avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he leisurely closed the register, put up his spectacles, and folded his
      scraps of paper in a large leathern pocket-book, we thought what a nice
      hard bargain he was driving with some poverty-stricken legatee, who, tired
      of waiting year after year, until some life-interest should fall in, was
      selling his chance, just as it began to grow most valuable, for a twelfth
      part of its worth. It was a good speculation-a very safe one. The old man
      stowed his pocket-book carefully in the breast of his great-coat, and
      hobbled away with a leer of triumph. That will had made him ten years
      younger at the lowest computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having commenced our observations, we should certainly have extended them
      to another dozen of people at least, had not a sudden shutting up and
      putting away of the worm-eaten old books, warned us that the time for
      closing the office had arrived; and thus deprived us of a pleasure, and
      spared our readers an infliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      We naturally fell into a train of reflection as we walked homewards, upon
      the curious old records of likings and dislikings; of jealousies and
      revenges; of affection defying the power of death, and hatred pursued
      beyond the grave, which these depositories contain; silent but striking
      tokens, some of them, of excellence of heart, and nobleness of soul;
      melancholy examples, others, of the worst passions of human nature. How
      many men as they lay speechless and helpless on the bed of death, would
      have given worlds but for the strength and power to blot out the silent
      evidence of animosity and bitterness, which now stands registered against
      them in Doctors' Commons!

      CHAPTER IX-LONDON RECREATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The wish of persons in the humbler classes of life, to ape the manners and
      customs of those whom fortune has placed above them, is often the subject
      of remark, and not unfrequently of complaint. The inclination may, and no
      doubt does, exist to a great extent, among the small gentility-the
      would-be aristocrats-of the middle classes. Tradesmen and clerks, with
      fashionable novel-reading families, and circulating- library-subscribing
      daughters, get up small assemblies in humble imitation of Almack's, and
      promenade the dingy 'large room' of some second-rate hotel with as much
      complacency as the enviable few who are privileged to exhibit their
      magnificence in that exclusive haunt of fashion and foolery. Aspiring
      young ladies, who read flaming accounts of some 'fancy fair in high life,'
      suddenly grow desperately charitable; visions of admiration and matrimony
      float before their eyes; some wonderfully meritorious institution, which,
      by the strangest accident in the world, has never been heard of before, is
      discovered to be in a languishing condition: Thomson's great room, or
      Johnson's nursery- ground, is forthwith engaged, and the aforesaid young
      ladies, from mere charity, exhibit themselves for three days, from twelve
      to four, for the small charge of one shilling per head! With the exception
      of these classes of society, however, and a few weak and insignificant
      persons, we do not think the attempt at imitation to which we have
      alluded, prevails in any great degree. The different character of the
      recreations of different classes, has often afforded us amusement; and we
      have chosen it for the subject of our present sketch, in the hope that it
      may possess some amusement for our readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the regular City man, who leaves Lloyd's at five o'clock, and drives
      home to Hackney, Clapton, Stamford-hill, or elsewhere, can be said to have
      any daily recreation beyond his dinner, it is his garden. He never does
      anything to it with his own hands; but he takes great pride in it
      notwithstanding; and if you are desirous of paying your addresses to the
      youngest daughter, be sure to be in raptures with every flower and shrub
      it contains. If your poverty of expression compel you to make any
      distinction between the two, we would certainly recommend your bestowing
      more admiration on his garden than his wine. He always takes a walk round
      it, before he starts for town in the morning, and is particularly anxious
      that the fish-pond should be kept specially neat. If you call on him on
      Sunday in summer-time, about an hour before dinner, you will find him
      sitting in an arm-chair, on the lawn behind the house, with a straw hat
      on, reading a Sunday paper. A short distance from him you will most likely
      observe a handsome paroquet in a large brass-wire cage; ten to one but the
      two eldest girls are loitering in one of the side walks accompanied by a
      couple of young gentlemen, who are holding parasols over them-of course
      only to keep the sun off-while the younger children, with the under
      nursery-maid, are strolling listlessly about, in the shade. Beyond these
      occasions, his delight in his garden appears to arise more from the
      consciousness of possession than actual enjoyment of it. When he drives
      you down to dinner on a week-day, he is rather fatigued with the
      occupations of the morning, and tolerably cross into the bargain; but when
      the cloth is removed, and he has drank three or four glasses of his
      favourite port, he orders the French windows of his dining-room (which of
      course look into the garden) to be opened, and throwing a silk
      handkerchief over his head, and leaning back in his arm- chair, descants
      at considerable length upon its beauty, and the cost of maintaining it.
      This is to impress you-who are a young friend of the family-with a due
      sense of the excellence of the garden, and the wealth of its owner; and
      when he has exhausted the subject, he goes to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another and a very different class of men, whose recreation is
      their garden. An individual of this class, resides some short distance
      from town-say in the Hampstead-road, or the Kilburn-road, or any other
      road where the houses are small and neat, and have little slips of back
      garden. He and his wife-who is as clean and compact a little body as
      himself-have occupied the same house ever since he retired from business
      twenty years ago. They have no family. They once had a son, who died at
      about five years old. The child's portrait hangs over the mantelpiece in
      the best sitting-room, and a little cart he used to draw about, is
      carefully preserved as a relic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fine weather the old gentleman is almost constantly in the garden; and
      when it is too wet to go into it, he will look out of the window at it, by
      the hour together. He has always something to do there, and you will see
      him digging, and sweeping, and cutting, and planting, with manifest
      delight. In spring-time, there is no end to the sowing of seeds, and
      sticking little bits of wood over them, with labels, which look like
      epitaphs to their memory; and in the evening, when the sun has gone down,
      the perseverance with which he lugs a great watering-pot about is
      perfectly astonishing. The only other recreation he has, is the newspaper,
      which he peruses every day, from beginning to end, generally reading the
      most interesting pieces of intelligence to his wife, during breakfast. The
      old lady is very fond of flowers, as the hyacinth-glasses in the
      parlour-window, and geranium-pots in the little front court, testify. She
      takes great pride in the garden too: and when one of the four fruit-trees
      produces rather a larger gooseberry than usual, it is carefully preserved
      under a wine-glass on the sideboard, for the edification of visitors, who
      are duly informed that Mr. So-and- so planted the tree which produced it,
      with his own hands. On a summer's evening, when the large watering-pot has
      been filled and emptied some fourteen times, and the old couple have quite
      exhausted themselves by trotting about, you will see them sitting happily
      together in the little summerhouse, enjoying the calm and peace of the
      twilight, and watching the shadows as they fall upon the garden, and
      gradually growing thicker and more sombre, obscure the tints of their
      gayest flowers-no bad emblem of the years that have silently rolled over
      their heads, deadening in their course the brightest hues of early hopes
      and feelings which have long since faded away. These are their only
      recreations, and they require no more. They have within themselves, the
      materials of comfort and content; and the only anxiety of each, is to die
      before the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is no ideal sketch. There used to be many old people of this
      description; their numbers may have diminished, and may decrease still
      more. Whether the course female education has taken of late days-whether
      the pursuit of giddy frivolities, and empty nothings, has tended to unfit
      women for that quiet domestic life, in which they show far more
      beautifully than in the most crowded assembly, is a question we should
      feel little gratification in discussing: we hope not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us turn now, to another portion of the London population, whose
      recreations present about as strong a contrast as can well be conceived-we
      mean the Sunday pleasurers; and let us beg our readers to imagine
      themselves stationed by our side in some well-known rural 'Tea- gardens.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat is intense this afternoon, and the people, of whom there are
      additional parties arriving every moment, look as warm as the tables which
      have been recently painted, and have the appearance of being red- hot.
      What a dust and noise! Men and women-boys and girls-sweethearts and
      married people-babies in arms, and children in chaises-pipes and
      shrimps-cigars and periwinkles-tea and tobacco. Gentlemen, in alarming
      waistcoats, and steel watch-guards, promenading about, three abreast, with
      surprising dignity (or as the gentleman in the next box facetiously
      observes, 'cutting it uncommon fat!')-ladies, with great, long, white
      pocket-handkerchiefs like small table-cloths, in their hands, chasing one
      another on the grass in the most playful and interesting manner, with the
      view of attracting the attention of the aforesaid gentlemen-husbands in
      perspective ordering bottles of ginger-beer for the objects of their
      affections, with a lavish disregard of expense; and the said objects
      washing down huge quantities of 'shrimps' and 'winkles,' with an equal
      disregard of their own bodily health and subsequent comfort-boys, with
      great silk hats just balanced on the top of their heads, smoking cigars,
      and trying to look as if they liked them-gentlemen in pink shirts and blue
      waistcoats, occasionally upsetting either themselves, or somebody else,
      with their own canes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the finery of these people provokes a smile, but they are all
      clean, and happy, and disposed to be good-natured and sociable. Those two
      motherly-looking women in the smart pelisses, who are chatting so
      confidentially, inserting a 'ma'am' at every fourth word, scraped an
      acquaintance about a quarter of an hour ago: it originated in admiration
      of the little boy who belongs to one of them-that diminutive specimen of
      mortality in the three-cornered pink satin hat with black feathers. The
      two men in the blue coats and drab trousers, who are walking up and down,
      smoking their pipes, are their husbands. The party in the opposite box are
      a pretty fair specimen of the generality of the visitors. These are the
      father and mother, and old grandmother: a young man and woman, and an
      individual addressed by the euphonious title of 'Uncle Bill,' who is
      evidently the wit of the party. They have some half-dozen children with
      them, but it is scarcely necessary to notice the fact, for that is a
      matter of course here. Every woman in 'the gardens,' who has been married
      for any length of time, must have had twins on two or three occasions; it
      is impossible to account for the extent of juvenile population in any
      other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the inexpressible delight of the old grandmother, at Uncle Bill's
      splendid joke of 'tea for four: bread-and-butter for forty;' and the loud
      explosion of mirth which follows his wafering a paper 'pigtail' on the
      waiter's collar. The young man is evidently 'keeping company' with Uncle
      Bill's niece: and Uncle Bill's hints-such as 'Don't forget me at the
      dinner, you know,' 'I shall look out for the cake, Sally,' 'I'll be
      godfather to your first-wager it's a boy,' and so forth, are equally
      embarrassing to the young people, and delightful to the elder ones. As to
      the old grandmother, she is in perfect ecstasies, and does nothing but
      laugh herself into fits of coughing, until they have finished the
      'gin-and-water warm with,' of which Uncle Bill ordered 'glasses round'
      after tea, 'just to keep the night air out, and to do it up comfortable
      and riglar arter sitch an as-tonishing hot day!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is getting dark, and the people begin to move. The field leading to
      town is quite full of them; the little hand-chaises are dragged wearily
      along, the children are tired, and amuse themselves and the company
      generally by crying, or resort to the much more pleasant expedient of
      going to sleep-the mothers begin to wish they were at home
      again-sweethearts grow more sentimental than ever, as the time for parting
      arrives-the gardens look mournful enough, by the light of the two lanterns
      which hang against the trees for the convenience of smokers-and the
      waiters who have been running about incessantly for the last six hours,
      think they feel a little tired, as they count their glasses and their
      gains.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X-THE RIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Are you fond of the water?' is a question very frequently asked, in hot
      summer weather, by amphibious-looking young men. 'Very,' is the general
      reply. 'An't you?'-'Hardly ever off it,' is the response, accompanied by
      sundry adjectives, expressive of the speaker's heartfelt admiration of
      that element. Now, with all respect for the opinion of society in general,
      and cutter clubs in particular, we humbly suggest that some of the most
      painful reminiscences in the mind of every individual who has occasionally
      disported himself on the Thames, must be connected with his aquatic
      recreations. Who ever heard of a successful water-party?-or to put the
      question in a still more intelligible form, who ever saw one? We have been
      on water excursions out of number, but we solemnly declare that we cannot
      call to mind one single occasion of the kind, which was not marked by more
      miseries than any one would suppose could be reasonably crowded into the
      space of some eight or nine hours. Something has always gone wrong. Either
      the cork of the salad-dressing has come out, or the most anxiously
      expected member of the party has not come out, or the most disagreeable
      man in company would come out, or a child or two have fallen into the
      water, or the gentleman who undertook to steer has endangered everybody's
      life all the way, or the gentlemen who volunteered to row have been 'out
      of practice,' and performed very alarming evolutions, putting their oars
      down into the water and not being able to get them up again, or taking
      terrific pulls without putting them in at all; in either case, pitching
      over on the backs of their heads with startling violence, and exhibiting
      the soles of their pumps to the 'sitters' in the boat, in a very
      humiliating manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We grant that the banks of the Thames are very beautiful at Richmond and
      Twickenham, and other distant havens, often sought though seldom reached;
      but from the 'Red-us' back to Blackfriars-bridge, the scene is wonderfully
      changed. The Penitentiary is a noble building, no doubt, and the sportive
      youths who 'go in' at that particular part of the river, on a summer's
      evening, may be all very well in perspective; but when you are obliged to
      keep in shore coming home, and the young ladies will colour up, and look
      perseveringly the other way, while the married dittos cough slightly, and
      stare very hard at the water, you feel awkward-especially if you happen to
      have been attempting the most distant approach to sentimentality, for an
      hour or two previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although experience and suffering have produced in our minds the result we
      have just stated, we are by no means blind to a proper sense of the fun
      which a looker-on may extract from the amateurs of boating. What can be
      more amusing than Searle's yard on a fine Sunday morning? It's a Richmond
      tide, and some dozen boats are preparing for the reception of the parties
      who have engaged them. Two or three fellows in great rough trousers and
      Guernsey shirts, are getting them ready by easy stages; now coming down
      the yard with a pair of sculls and a cushion-then having a chat with the
      'Jack,' who, like all his tribe, seems to be wholly incapable of doing
      anything but lounging about-then going back again, and returning with a
      rudder-line and a stretcher-then solacing themselves with another chat-and
      then wondering, with their hands in their capacious pockets, 'where them
      gentlemen's got to as ordered the six.' One of these, the head man, with
      the legs of his trousers carefully tucked up at the bottom, to admit the
      water, we presume-for it is an element in which he is infinitely more at
      home than on land-is quite a character, and shares with the defunct
      oyster-swallower the celebrated name of 'Dando.' Watch him, as taking a
      few minutes' respite from his toils, he negligently seats himself on the
      edge of a boat, and fans his broad bushy chest with a cap scarcely half so
      furry. Look at his magnificent, though reddish whiskers, and mark the
      somewhat native humour with which he 'chaffs' the boys and 'prentices, or
      cunningly gammons the gen'lm'n into the gift of a glass of gin, of which
      we verily believe he swallows in one day as much as any six ordinary men,
      without ever being one atom the worse for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the party arrives, and Dando, relieved from his state of uncertainty,
      starts up into activity. They approach in full aquatic costume, with round
      blue jackets, striped shirts, and caps of all sizes and patterns, from the
      velvet skull-cap of French manufacture, to the easy head-dress familiar to
      the students of the old spelling-books, as having, on the authority of the
      portrait, formed part of the costume of the Reverend Mr. Dilworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the most amusing time to observe a regular Sunday water-party.
      There has evidently been up to this period no inconsiderable degree of
      boasting on everybody's part relative to his knowledge of navigation; the
      sight of the water rapidly cools their courage, and the air of self-
      denial with which each of them insists on somebody else's taking an oar,
      is perfectly delightful. At length, after a great deal of changing and
      fidgeting, consequent upon the election of a stroke-oar: the inability of
      one gentleman to pull on this side, of another to pull on that, and of a
      third to pull at all, the boat's crew are seated. 'Shove her off!' cries
      the cockswain, who looks as easy and comfortable as if he were steering in
      the Bay of Biscay. The order is obeyed; the boat is immediately turned
      completely round, and proceeds towards Westminster- bridge, amidst such a
      splashing and struggling as never was seen before, except when the Royal
      George went down. 'Back wa'ater, sir,' shouts Dando, 'Back wa'ater, you
      sir, aft;' upon which everybody thinking he must be the individual
      referred to, they all back water, and back comes the boat, stern first, to
      the spot whence it started. 'Back water, you sir, aft; pull round, you
      sir, for'ad, can't you?' shouts Dando, in a frenzy of excitement. 'Pull
      round, Tom, can't you?' re-echoes one of the party. 'Tom an't for'ad,'
      replies another. 'Yes, he is,' cries a third; and the unfortunate young
      man, at the imminent risk of breaking a blood-vessel, pulls and pulls,
      until the head of the boat fairly lies in the direction of
      Vauxhall-bridge. 'That's right-now pull all on you!' shouts Dando again,
      adding, in an under-tone, to somebody by him, 'Blowed if hever I see sich
      a set of muffs!' and away jogs the boat in a zigzag direction, every one
      of the six oars dipping into the water at a different time; and the yard
      is once more clear, until the arrival of the next party.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-contested rowing-match on the Thames, is a very lively and
      interesting scene. The water is studded with boats of all sorts, kinds,
      and descriptions; places in the coal-barges at the different wharfs are
      let to crowds of spectators, beer and tobacco flow freely about; men,
      women, and children wait for the start in breathless expectation; cutters
      of six and eight oars glide gently up and down, waiting to accompany their
      protACgACs during the race; bands of music add to the animation, if not to
      the harmony of the scene; groups of watermen are assembled at the
      different stairs, discussing the merits of the respective candidates; and
      the prize wherry, which is rowed slowly about by a pair of sculls, is an
      object of general interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two o'clock strikes, and everybody looks anxiously in the direction of the
      bridge through which the candidates for the prize will come-half- past
      two, and the general attention which has been preserved so long begins to
      flag, when suddenly a gun is heard, and a noise of distant hurra'ing along
      each bank of the river-every head is bent forward-the noise draws nearer
      and nearer-the boats which have been waiting at the bridge start briskly
      up the river, and a well-manned galley shoots through the arch, the
      sitters cheering on the boats behind them, which are not yet visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here they are,' is the general cry-and through darts the first boat, the
      men in her, stripped to the skin, and exerting every muscle to preserve
      the advantage they have gained-four other boats follow close astern; there
      are not two boats' length between them-the shouting is tremendous, and the
      interest intense. 'Go on, Pink'-'Give it her, Red'-'Sulliwin for
      ever'-'Bravo! George'-'Now, Tom, now-now-now-why don't your partner
      stretch out?'-'Two pots to a pint on Yellow,' &amp;c., &amp;c. Every
      little public-house fires its gun, and hoists its flag; and the men who
      win the heat, come in, amidst a splashing and shouting, and banging and
      confusion, which no one can imagine who has not witnessed it, and of which
      any description would convey a very faint idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most amusing places we know is the steam-wharf of the London
      Bridge, or St. Katharine's Dock Company, on a Saturday morning in summer,
      when the Gravesend and Margate steamers are usually crowded to excess; and
      as we have just taken a glance at the river above bridge, we hope our
      readers will not object to accompany us on board a Gravesend packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coaches are every moment setting down at the entrance to the wharf, and
      the stare of bewildered astonishment with which the 'fares' resign
      themselves and their luggage into the hands of the porters, who seize all
      the packages at once as a matter of course, and run away with them, heaven
      knows where, is laughable in the extreme. A Margate boat lies alongside
      the wharf, the Gravesend boat (which starts first) lies alongside that
      again; and as a temporary communication is formed between the two, by
      means of a plank and hand-rail, the natural confusion of the scene is by
      no means diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gravesend?' inquires a stout father of a stout family, who follow him,
      under the guidance of their mother, and a servant, at the no small risk of
      two or three of them being left behind in the confusion. 'Gravesend?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pass on, if you please, sir,' replies the attendant-'other boat, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon the stout father, being rather mystified, and the stout mother
      rather distracted by maternal anxiety, the whole party deposit themselves
      in the Margate boat, and after having congratulated himself on having
      secured very comfortable seats, the stout father sallies to the chimney to
      look for his luggage, which he has a faint recollection of having given
      some man, something, to take somewhere. No luggage, however, bearing the
      most remote resemblance to his own, in shape or form, is to be discovered;
      on which the stout father calls very loudly for an officer, to whom he
      states the case, in the presence of another father of another family-a
      little thin man-who entirely concurs with him (the stout father) in
      thinking that it's high time something was done with these steam
      companies, and that as the Corporation Bill failed to do it, something
      else must; for really people's property is not to be sacrificed in this
      way; and that if the luggage isn't restored without delay, he will take
      care it shall be put in the papers, for the public is not to be the victim
      of these great monopolies. To this, the officer, in his turn, replies,
      that that company, ever since it has been St. Kat'rine's Dock Company, has
      protected life and property; that if it had been the London Bridge Wharf
      Company, indeed, he shouldn't have wondered, seeing that the morality of
      that company (they being the opposition) can't be answered for, by no one;
      but as it is, he's convinced there must be some mistake, and he wouldn't
      mind making a solemn oath afore a magistrate that the gentleman'll find
      his luggage afore he gets to Margate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the stout father, thinking he is making a capital point, replies,
      that as it happens, he is not going to Margate at all, and that 'Passenger
      to Gravesend' was on the luggage, in letters of full two inches long; on
      which the officer rapidly explains the mistake, and the stout mother, and
      the stout children, and the servant, are hurried with all possible
      despatch on board the Gravesend boat, which they reached just in time to
      discover that their luggage is there, and that their comfortable seats are
      not. Then the bell, which is the signal for the Gravesend boat starting,
      begins to ring most furiously: and people keep time to the bell, by
      running in and out of our boat at a double-quick pace. The bell stops; the
      boat starts: people who have been taking leave of their friends on board,
      are carried away against their will; and people who have been taking leave
      of their friends on shore, find that they have performed a very needless
      ceremony, in consequence of their not being carried away at all. The
      regular passengers, who have season tickets, go below to breakfast; people
      who have purchased morning papers, compose themselves to read them; and
      people who have not been down the river before, think that both the
      shipping and the water, look a great deal better at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we get down about as far as Blackwall, and begin to move at a quicker
      rate, the spirits of the passengers appear to rise in proportion. Old
      women who have brought large wicker hand-baskets with them, set seriously
      to work at the demolition of heavy sandwiches, and pass round a
      wine-glass, which is frequently replenished from a flat bottle like a
      stomach-warmer, with considerable glee: handing it first to the gentleman
      in the foraging-cap, who plays the harp-partly as an expression of
      satisfaction with his previous exertions, and partly to induce him to play
      'Dumbledumbdeary,' for 'Alick' to dance to; which being done, Alick, who
      is a damp earthy child in red worsted socks, takes certain small jumps
      upon the deck, to the unspeakable satisfaction of his family circle. Girls
      who have brought the first volume of some new novel in their reticule,
      become extremely plaintive, and expatiate to Mr. Brown, or young Mr.
      O'Brien, who has been looking over them, on the blueness of the sky, and
      brightness of the water; on which Mr. Brown or Mr. O'Brien, as the case
      may be, remarks in a low voice that he has been quite insensible of late
      to the beauties of nature, that his whole thoughts and wishes have centred
      in one object alone-whereupon the young lady looks up, and failing in her
      attempt to appear unconscious, looks down again; and turns over the next
      leaf with great difficulty, in order to afford opportunity for a
      lengthened pressure of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telescopes, sandwiches, and glasses of brandy-and-water cold without,
      begin to be in great requisition; and bashful men who have been looking
      down the hatchway at the engine, find, to their great relief, a subject on
      which they can converse with one another-and a copious one too-Steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wonderful thing steam, sir.' 'Ah! (a deep-drawn sigh) it is indeed, sir.'
      'Great power, sir.' 'Immense-immense!' 'Great deal done by steam, sir.'
      'Ah! (another sigh at the immensity of the subject, and a knowing shake of
      the head) you may say that, sir.' 'Still in its infancy, they say, sir.'
      Novel remarks of this kind, are generally the commencement of a
      conversation which is prolonged until the conclusion of the trip, and,
      perhaps, lays the foundation of a speaking acquaintance between
      half-a-dozen gentlemen, who, having their families at Gravesend, take
      season tickets for the boat, and dine on board regularly every afternoon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI-ASTLEY'S
    </h2>
    <p>
      We never see any very large, staring, black Roman capitals, in a book, or
      shop-window, or placarded on a wall, without their immediately recalling
      to our mind an indistinct and confused recollection of the time when we
      were first initiated in the mysteries of the alphabet. We almost fancy we
      see the pin's point following the letter, to impress its form more
      strongly on our bewildered imagination; and wince involuntarily, as we
      remember the hard knuckles with which the reverend old lady who instilled
      into our mind the first principles of education for ninepence per week, or
      ten and sixpence per quarter, was wont to poke our juvenile head
      occasionally, by way of adjusting the confusion of ideas in which we were
      generally involved. The same kind of feeling pursues us in many other
      instances, but there is no place which recalls so strongly our
      recollections of childhood as Astley's. It was not a 'Royal Amphitheatre'
      in those days, nor had Ducrow arisen to shed the light of classic taste
      and portable gas over the sawdust of the circus; but the whole character
      of the place was the same, the pieces were the same, the clown's jokes
      were the same, the riding-masters were equally grand, the comic performers
      equally witty, the tragedians equally hoarse, and the 'highly-trained
      chargers' equally spirited. Astley's has altered for the better-we have
      changed for the worse. Our histrionic taste is gone, and with shame we
      confess, that we are far more delighted and amused with the audience, than
      with the pageantry we once so highly appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We like to watch a regular Astley's party in the Easter or Midsummer
      holidays-pa and ma, and nine or ten children, varying from five foot six
      to two foot eleven: from fourteen years of age to four. We had just taken
      our seat in one of the boxes, in the centre of the house, the other night,
      when the next was occupied by just such a party as we should have
      attempted to describe, had we depicted our beau idACal of a group of
      Astley's visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, there came three little boys and a little girl, who, in
      pursuance of pa's directions, issued in a very audible voice from the
      box-door, occupied the front row; then two more little girls were ushered
      in by a young lady, evidently the governess. Then came three more little
      boys, dressed like the first, in blue jackets and trousers, with lay-down
      shirt-collars: then a child in a braided frock and high state of
      astonishment, with very large round eyes, opened to their utmost width,
      was lifted over the seats-a process which occasioned a considerable
      display of little pink legs-then came ma and pa, and then the eldest son,
      a boy of fourteen years old, who was evidently trying to look as if he did
      not belong to the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first five minutes were occupied in taking the shawls off the little
      girls, and adjusting the bows which ornamented their hair; then it was
      providentially discovered that one of the little boys was seated behind a
      pillar and could not see, so the governess was stuck behind the pillar,
      and the boy lifted into her place. Then pa drilled the boys, and directed
      the stowing away of their pocket-handkerchiefs, and ma having first nodded
      and winked to the governess to pull the girls' frocks a little more off
      their shoulders, stood up to review the little troop-an inspection which
      appeared to terminate much to her own satisfaction, for she looked with a
      complacent air at pa, who was standing up at the further end of the seat.
      Pa returned the glance, and blew his nose very emphatically; and the poor
      governess peeped out from behind the pillar, and timidly tried to catch
      ma's eye, with a look expressive of her high admiration of the whole
      family. Then two of the little boys who had been discussing the point
      whether Astley's was more than twice as large as Drury Lane, agreed to
      refer it to 'George' for his decision; at which 'George,' who was no other
      than the young gentleman before noticed, waxed indignant, and remonstrated
      in no very gentle terms on the gross impropriety of having his name
      repeated in so loud a voice at a public place, on which all the children
      laughed very heartily, and one of the little boys wound up by expressing
      his opinion, that 'George began to think himself quite a man now,'
      whereupon both pa and ma laughed too; and George (who carried a dress cane
      and was cultivating whiskers) muttered that 'William always was encouraged
      in his impertinence;' and assumed a look of profound contempt, which
      lasted the whole evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play began, and the interest of the little boys knew no bounds. Pa was
      clearly interested too, although he very unsuccessfully endeavoured to
      look as if he wasn't. As for ma, she was perfectly overcome by the
      drollery of the principal comedian, and laughed till every one of the
      immense bows on her ample cap trembled, at which the governess peeped out
      from behind the pillar again, and whenever she could catch ma's eye, put
      her handkerchief to her mouth, and appeared, as in duty bound, to be in
      convulsions of laughter also. Then when the man in the splendid armour
      vowed to rescue the lady or perish in the attempt, the little boys
      applauded vehemently, especially one little fellow who was apparently on a
      visit to the family, and had been carrying on a child's flirtation, the
      whole evening, with a small coquette of twelve years old, who looked like
      a model of her mamma on a reduced scale; and who, in common with the other
      little girls (who generally speaking have even more coquettishness about
      them than much older ones), looked very properly shocked, when the
      knight's squire kissed the princess's confidential chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the scenes in the circle commenced, the children were more delighted
      than ever; and the wish to see what was going forward, completely
      conquering pa's dignity, he stood up in the box, and applauded as loudly
      as any of them. Between each feat of horsemanship, the governess leant
      across to ma, and retailed the clever remarks of the children on that
      which had preceded: and ma, in the openness of her heart, offered the
      governess an acidulated drop, and the governess, gratified to be taken
      notice of, retired behind her pillar again with a brighter countenance:
      and the whole party seemed quite happy, except the exquisite in the back
      of the box, who, being too grand to take any interest in the children, and
      too insignificant to be taken notice of by anybody else, occupied himself,
      from time to time, in rubbing the place where the whiskers ought to be,
      and was completely alone in his glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      We defy any one who has been to Astley's two or three times, and is
      consequently capable of appreciating the perseverance with which precisely
      the same jokes are repeated night after night, and season after season,
      not to be amused with one part of the performances at least-we mean the
      scenes in the circle. For ourself, we know that when the hoop, composed of
      jets of gas, is let down, the curtain drawn up for the convenience of the
      half-price on their ejectment from the ring, the orange-peel cleared away,
      and the sawdust shaken, with mathematical precision, into a complete
      circle, we feel as much enlivened as the youngest child present; and
      actually join in the laugh which follows the clown's shrill shout of 'Here
      we are!' just for old acquaintance' sake. Nor can we quite divest ourself
      of our old feeling of reverence for the riding-master, who follows the
      clown with a long whip in his hand, and bows to the audience with graceful
      dignity. He is none of your second- rate riding-masters in nankeen
      dressing-gowns, with brown frogs, but the regular gentleman-attendant on
      the principal riders, who always wears a military uniform with a
      table-cloth inside the breast of the coat, in which costume he forcibly
      reminds one of a fowl trussed for roasting. He is-but why should we
      attempt to describe that of which no description can convey an adequate
      idea? Everybody knows the man, and everybody remembers his polished boots,
      his graceful demeanour, stiff, as some misjudging persons have in their
      jealousy considered it, and the splendid head of black hair, parted high
      on the forehead, to impart to the countenance an appearance of deep
      thought and poetic melancholy. His soft and pleasing voice, too, is in
      perfect unison with his noble bearing, as he humours the clown by
      indulging in a little badinage; and the striking recollection of his own
      dignity, with which he exclaims, 'Now, sir, if you please, inquire for
      Miss Woolford, sir,' can never be forgotten. The graceful air, too, with
      which he introduces Miss Woolford into the arena, and, after assisting her
      to the saddle, follows her fairy courser round the circle, can never fail
      to create a deep impression in the bosom of every female servant present.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Woolford, and the horse, and the orchestra, all stop together to
      take breath, he urbanely takes part in some such dialogue as the following
      (commenced by the clown): 'I say, sir!'-'Well, sir?' (it's always
      conducted in the politest manner.)-'Did you ever happen to hear I was in
      the army, sir?'-'No, sir.'-'Oh, yes, sir-I can go through my exercise,
      sir.'-'Indeed, sir!'-'Shall I do it now, sir?'-'If you please, sir; come,
      sir-make haste' (a cut with the long whip, and 'Ha' done now-I don't like
      it,' from the clown). Here the clown throws himself on the ground, and
      goes through a variety of gymnastic convulsions, doubling himself up, and
      untying himself again, and making himself look very like a man in the most
      hopeless extreme of human agony, to the vociferous delight of the gallery,
      until he is interrupted by a second cut from the long whip, and a request
      to see 'what Miss Woolford's stopping for?' On which, to the inexpressible
      mirth of the gallery, he exclaims, 'Now, Miss Woolford, what can I come
      for to go, for to fetch, for to bring, for to carry, for to do, for you,
      ma'am?' On the lady's announcing with a sweet smile that she wants the two
      flags, they are, with sundry grimaces, procured and handed up; the clown
      facetiously observing after the performance of the latter ceremony-'He,
      he, oh! I say, sir, Miss Woolford knows me; she smiled at me.' Another cut
      from the whip, a burst from the orchestra, a start from the horse, and
      round goes Miss Woolford again on her graceful performance, to the delight
      of every member of the audience, young or old. The next pause affords an
      opportunity for similar witticisms, the only additional fun being that of
      the clown making ludicrous grimaces at the riding-master every time his
      back is turned; and finally quitting the circle by jumping over his head,
      having previously directed his attention another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did any of our readers ever notice the class of people, who hang about the
      stage-doors of our minor theatres in the daytime? You will rarely pass one
      of these entrances without seeing a group of three or four men conversing
      on the pavement, with an indescribable public-house-parlour swagger, and a
      kind of conscious air, peculiar to people of this description. They always
      seem to think they are exhibiting; the lamps are ever before them. That
      young fellow in the faded brown coat, and very full light green trousers,
      pulls down the wristbands of his check shirt, as ostentatiously as if it
      were of the finest linen, and cocks the white hat of the
      summer-before-last as knowingly over his right eye, as if it were a
      purchase of yesterday. Look at the dirty white Berlin gloves, and the
      cheap silk handkerchief stuck in the bosom of his threadbare coat. Is it
      possible to see him for an instant, and not come to the conclusion that he
      is the walking gentleman who wears a blue surtout, clean collar, and white
      trousers, for half an hour, and then shrinks into his worn-out scanty
      clothes: who has to boast night after night of his splendid fortune, with
      the painful consciousness of a pound a-week and his boots to find; to talk
      of his father's mansion in the country, with a dreary recollection of his
      own two-pair back, in the New Cut; and to be envied and flattered as the
      favoured lover of a rich heiress, remembering all the while that the
      ex-dancer at home is in the family way, and out of an engagement?
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to him, perhaps, you will see a thin pale man, with a very long face,
      in a suit of shining black, thoughtfully knocking that part of his boot
      which once had a heel, with an ash stick. He is the man who does the heavy
      business, such as prosy fathers, virtuous servants, curates, landlords,
      and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, talking of fathers, we should very much like to see some piece
      in which all the dramatis personae were orphans. Fathers are invariably
      great nuisances on the stage, and always have to give the hero or heroine
      a long explanation of what was done before the curtain rose, usually
      commencing with 'It is now nineteen years, my dear child, since your
      blessed mother (here the old villain's voice falters) confided you to my
      charge. You were then an infant,' &amp;c., &amp;c. Or else they have to
      discover, all of a sudden, that somebody whom they have been in constant
      communication with, during three long acts, without the slightest
      suspicion, is their own child: in which case they exclaim, 'Ah! what do I
      see? This bracelet! That smile! These documents! Those eyes! Can I believe
      my senses?-It must be!-Yes-it is, it is my child!'-'My father!' exclaims
      the child; and they fall into each other's arms, and look over each
      other's shoulders, and the audience give three rounds of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return from this digression, we were about to say, that these are the
      sort of people whom you see talking, and attitudinising, outside the
      stage-doors of our minor theatres. At Astley's they are always more
      numerous than at any other place. There is generally a groom or two,
      sitting on the window-sill, and two or three dirty shabby-genteel men in
      checked neckerchiefs, and sallow linen, lounging about, and carrying,
      perhaps, under one arm, a pair of stage shoes badly wrapped up in a piece
      of old newspaper. Some years ago we used to stand looking, open- mouthed,
      at these men, with a feeling of mysterious curiosity, the very
      recollection of which provokes a smile at the moment we are writing. We
      could not believe that the beings of light and elegance, in milk-white
      tunics, salmon-coloured legs, and blue scarfs, who flitted on sleek
      cream-coloured horses before our eyes at night, with all the aid of
      lights, music, and artificial flowers, could be the pale, dissipated-
      looking creatures we beheld by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can hardly believe it now. Of the lower class of actors we have seen
      something, and it requires no great exercise of imagination to identify
      the walking gentleman with the 'dirty swell,' the comic singer with the
      public-house chairman, or the leading tragedian with drunkenness and
      distress; but these other men are mysterious beings, never seen out of the
      ring, never beheld but in the costume of gods and sylphs. With the
      exception of Ducrow, who can scarcely be classed among them, who ever knew
      a rider at Astley's, or saw him but on horseback? Can our friend in the
      military uniform ever appear in threadbare attire, or descend to the
      comparatively un-wadded costume of every-day life? Impossible! We
      cannot-we will not-believe it.

      CHAPTER XII-GREENWICH FAIR
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the Parks be 'the lungs of London,' we wonder what Greenwich Fair is-a
      periodical breaking out, we suppose, a sort of spring-rash: a three days'
      fever, which cools the blood for six months afterwards, and at the
      expiration of which London is restored to its old habits of plodding
      industry, as suddenly and completely as if nothing had ever happened to
      disturb them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our earlier days, we were a constant frequenter of Greenwich Fair, for
      years. We have proceeded to, and returned from it, in almost every
      description of vehicle. We cannot conscientiously deny the charge of
      having once made the passage in a spring-van, accompanied by thirteen
      gentlemen, fourteen ladies, an unlimited number of children, and a barrel
      of beer; and we have a vague recollection of having, in later days, found
      ourself the eighth outside, on the top of a hackney-coach, at something
      past four o'clock in the morning, with a rather confused idea of our own
      name, or place of residence. We have grown older since then, and quiet,
      and steady: liking nothing better than to spend our Easter, and all our
      other holidays, in some quiet nook, with people of whom we shall never
      tire; but we think we still remember something of Greenwich Fair, and of
      those who resort to it. At all events we will try.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road to Greenwich during the whole of Easter Monday, is in a state of
      perpetual bustle and noise. Cabs, hackney-coaches, 'shay' carts,
      coal-waggons, stages, omnibuses, sociables, gigs, donkey-chaises-all
      crammed with people (for the question never is, what the horse can draw,
      but what the vehicle will hold), roll along at their utmost speed; the
      dust flies in clouds, ginger-beer corks go off in volleys, the balcony of
      every public-house is crowded with people, smoking and drinking, half the
      private houses are turned into tea-shops, fiddles are in great request,
      every little fruit-shop displays its stall of gilt gingerbread and penny
      toys; turnpike men are in despair; horses won't go on, and wheels will
      come off; ladies in 'carawans' scream with fright at every fresh
      concussion, and their admirers find it necessary to sit remarkably close
      to them, by way of encouragement; servants-of-all-work, who are not
      allowed to have followers, and have got a holiday for the day, make the
      most of their time with the faithful admirer who waits for a stolen
      interview at the corner of the street every night, when they go to fetch
      the beer-apprentices grow sentimental, and straw-bonnet makers kind.
      Everybody is anxious to get on, and actuated by the common wish to be at
      the fair, or in the park, as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pedestrians linger in groups at the roadside, unable to resist the
      allurements of the stout proprietress of the 'Jack-in-the-box, three shies
      a penny,' or the more splendid offers of the man with three thimbles and a
      pea on a little round board, who astonishes the bewildered crowd with some
      such address as, 'Here's the sort o' game to make you laugh seven years
      arter you're dead, and turn ev'ry air on your ed gray vith delight! Three
      thimbles and vun little pea-with a vun, two, three, and a two, three, vun:
      catch him who can, look on, keep your eyes open, and niver say die! niver
      mind the change, and the expense: all fair and above board: them as don't
      play can't vin, and luck attend the ryal sportsman! Bet any gen'lm'n any
      sum of money, from harf-a- crown up to a suverin, as he doesn't name the
      thimble as kivers the pea!' Here some greenhorn whispers his friend that
      he distinctly saw the pea roll under the middle thimble-an impression
      which is immediately confirmed by a gentleman in top-boots, who is
      standing by, and who, in a low tone, regrets his own inability to bet, in
      consequence of having unfortunately left his purse at home, but strongly
      urges the stranger not to neglect such a golden opportunity. The 'plant'
      is successful, the bet is made, the stranger of course loses: and the
      gentleman with the thimbles consoles him, as he pockets the money, with an
      assurance that it's 'all the fortin of war! this time I vin, next time you
      vin: niver mind the loss of two bob and a bender! Do it up in a small
      parcel, and break out in a fresh place. Here's the sort o' game,' &amp;c.-and
      the eloquent harangue, with such variations as the speaker's exuberant
      fancy suggests, is again repeated to the gaping crowd, reinforced by the
      accession of several new-comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief place of resort in the daytime, after the public-houses, is the
      park, in which the principal amusement is to drag young ladies up the
      steep hill which leads to the Observatory, and then drag them down again,
      at the very top of their speed, greatly to the derangement of their curls
      and bonnet-caps, and much to the edification of lookers-on from below.
      'Kiss in the Ring,' and 'Threading my Grandmother's Needle,' too, are
      sports which receive their full share of patronage. Love-sick swains,
      under the influence of gin-and-water, and the tender passion, become
      violently affectionate: and the fair objects of their regard enhance the
      value of stolen kisses, by a vast deal of struggling, and holding down of
      heads, and cries of 'Oh! Ha' done, then, George-Oh, do tickle him for me,
      Mary-Well, I never!' and similar Lucretian ejaculations. Little old men
      and women, with a small basket under one arm, and a wine-glass, without a
      foot, in the other hand, tender 'a drop o' the right sort' to the
      different groups; and young ladies, who are persuaded to indulge in a drop
      of the aforesaid right sort, display a pleasing degree of reluctance to
      taste it, and cough afterwards with great propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old pensioners, who, for the moderate charge of a penny, exhibit the
      mast-house, the Thames and shipping, the place where the men used to hang
      in chains, and other interesting sights, through a telescope, are asked
      questions about objects within the range of the glass, which it would
      puzzle a Solomon to answer; and requested to find out particular houses in
      particular streets, which it would have been a task of some difficulty for
      Mr. Horner (not the young gentleman who ate mince-pies with his thumb, but
      the man of Colosseum notoriety) to discover. Here and there, where some
      three or four couple are sitting on the grass together, you will see a
      sun-burnt woman in a red cloak 'telling fortunes' and prophesying
      husbands, which it requires no extraordinary observation to describe, for
      the originals are before her. Thereupon, the lady concerned laughs and
      blushes, and ultimately buries her face in an imitation cambric
      handkerchief, and the gentleman described looks extremely foolish, and
      squeezes her hand, and fees the gipsy liberally; and the gipsy goes away,
      perfectly satisfied herself, and leaving those behind her perfectly
      satisfied also: and the prophecy, like many other prophecies of greater
      importance, fulfils itself in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it grows dark: the crowd has gradually dispersed, and only a few
      stragglers are left behind. The light in the direction of the church shows
      that the fair is illuminated; and the distant noise proves it to be
      filling fast. The spot, which half an hour ago was ringing with the shouts
      of boisterous mirth, is as calm and quiet as if nothing could ever disturb
      its serenity: the fine old trees, the majestic building at their feet,
      with the noble river beyond, glistening in the moonlight, appear in all
      their beauty, and under their most favourable aspect; the voices of the
      boys, singing their evening hymn, are borne gently on the air; and the
      humblest mechanic who has been lingering on the grass so pleasant to the
      feet that beat the same dull round from week to week in the paved streets
      of London, feels proud to think as he surveys the scene before him, that
      he belongs to the country which has selected such a spot as a retreat for
      its oldest and best defenders in the decline of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes' walking brings you to the fair; a scene calculated to awaken
      very different feelings. The entrance is occupied on either side by the
      vendors of gingerbread and toys: the stalls are gaily lighted up, the most
      attractive goods profusely disposed, and unbonneted young ladies, in their
      zeal for the interest of their employers, seize you by the coat, and use
      all the blandishments of 'Do, dear'-'There's a love'-'Don't be cross,
      now,' &amp;c., to induce you to purchase half a pound of the real spice
      nuts, of which the majority of the regular fair-goers carry a pound or two
      as a present supply, tied up in a cotton pocket- handkerchief.
      Occasionally you pass a deal table, on which are exposed pen'orths of
      pickled salmon (fennel included), in little white saucers: oysters, with
      shells as large as cheese-plates, and divers specimens of a species of
      snail (wilks, we think they are called), floating in a somewhat
      bilious-looking green liquid. Cigars, too, are in great demand; gentlemen
      must smoke, of course, and here they are, two a penny, in a regular
      authentic cigar-box, with a lighted tallow candle in the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine yourself in an extremely dense crowd, which swings you to and fro,
      and in and out, and every way but the right one; add to this the screams
      of women, the shouts of boys, the clanging of gongs, the firing of
      pistols, the ringing of bells, the bellowings of speaking-trumpets, the
      squeaking of penny dittos, the noise of a dozen bands, with three drums in
      each, all playing different tunes at the same time, the hallooing of
      showmen, and an occasional roar from the wild-beast shows; and you are in
      the very centre and heart of the fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This immense booth, with the large stage in front, so brightly illuminated
      with variegated lamps, and pots of burning fat, is 'Richardson's,' where
      you have a melodrama (with three murders and a ghost), a pantomime, a
      comic song, an overture, and some incidental music, all done in
      five-and-twenty minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company are now promenading outside in all the dignity of wigs,
      spangles, red-ochre, and whitening. See with what a ferocious air the
      gentleman who personates the Mexican chief, paces up and down, and with
      what an eye of calm dignity the principal tragedian gazes on the crowd
      below, or converses confidentially with the harlequin! The four clowns,
      who are engaged in a mock broadsword combat, may be all very well for the
      low-minded holiday-makers; but these are the people for the reflective
      portion of the community. They look so noble in those Roman dresses, with
      their yellow legs and arms, long black curly heads, bushy eyebrows, and
      scowl expressive of assassination, and vengeance, and everything else that
      is grand and solemn. Then, the ladies-were there ever such innocent and
      awful-looking beings; as they walk up and down the platform in twos and
      threes, with their arms round each other's waists, or leaning for support
      on one of those majestic men! Their spangled muslin dresses and blue satin
      shoes and sandals (a leetle the worse for wear) are the admiration of all
      beholders; and the playful manner in which they check the advances of the
      clown, is perfectly enchanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just a-going to begin! Pray come for'erd, come for'erd,' exclaims the man
      in the countryman's dress, for the seventieth time: and people force their
      way up the steps in crowds. The band suddenly strikes up, the harlequin
      and columbine set the example, reels are formed in less than no time, the
      Roman heroes place their arms a-kimbo, and dance with considerable
      agility; and the leading tragic actress, and the gentleman who enacts the
      'swell' in the pantomime, foot it to perfection. 'All in to begin,' shouts
      the manager, when no more people can be induced to 'come for'erd,' and
      away rush the leading members of the company to do the dreadful in the
      first piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      A change of performance takes place every day during the fair, but the
      story of the tragedy is always pretty much the same. There is a rightful
      heir, who loves a young lady, and is beloved by her; and a wrongful heir,
      who loves her too, and isn't beloved by her; and the wrongful heir gets
      hold of the rightful heir, and throws him into a dungeon, just to kill him
      off when convenient, for which purpose he hires a couple of assassins-a
      good one and a bad one-who, the moment they are left alone, get up a
      little murder on their own account, the good one killing the bad one, and
      the bad one wounding the good one. Then the rightful heir is discovered in
      prison, carefully holding a long chain in his hands, and seated
      despondingly in a large arm-chair; and the young lady comes in to two bars
      of soft music, and embraces the rightful heir; and then the wrongful heir
      comes in to two bars of quick music (technically called 'a hurry'), and
      goes on in the most shocking manner, throwing the young lady about as if
      she was nobody, and calling the rightful heir 'Ar-recreant-ar-wretch!' in
      a very loud voice, which answers the double purpose of displaying his
      passion, and preventing the sound being deadened by the sawdust. The
      interest becomes intense; the wrongful heir draws his sword, and rushes on
      the rightful heir; a blue smoke is seen, a gong is heard, and a tall white
      figure (who has been all this time, behind the arm-chair, covered over
      with a table-cloth), slowly rises to the tune of 'Oft in the stilly
      night.' This is no other than the ghost of the rightful heir's father, who
      was killed by the wrongful heir's father, at sight of which the wrongful
      heir becomes apoplectic, and is literally 'struck all of a heap,' the
      stage not being large enough to admit of his falling down at full length.
      Then the good assassin staggers in, and says he was hired in conjunction
      with the bad assassin, by the wrongful heir, to kill the rightful heir;
      and he's killed a good many people in his time, but he's very sorry for
      it, and won't do so any more-a promise which he immediately redeems, by
      dying off hand without any nonsense about it. Then the rightful heir
      throws down his chain; and then two men, a sailor, and a young woman (the
      tenantry of the rightful heir) come in, and the ghost makes dumb motions
      to them, which they, by supernatural interference, understand-for no one
      else can; and the ghost (who can't do anything without blue fire) blesses
      the rightful heir and the young lady, by half suffocating them with smoke:
      and then a muffin-bell rings, and the curtain drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exhibitions next in popularity to these itinerant theatres are the
      travelling menageries, or, to speak more intelligibly, the 'Wild-beast
      shows,' where a military band in beef-eater's costume, with leopard-skin
      caps, play incessantly; and where large highly-coloured representations of
      tigers tearing men's heads open, and a lion being burnt with red-hot irons
      to induce him to drop his victim, are hung up outside, by way of
      attracting visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal officer at these places is generally a very tall, hoarse
      man, in a scarlet coat, with a cane in his hand, with which he
      occasionally raps the pictures we have just noticed, by way of
      illustrating his description-something in this way. 'Here, here, here; the
      lion, the lion (tap), exactly as he is represented on the canvas outside
      (three taps): no waiting, remember; no deception. The fe-ro- cious lion
      (tap, tap) who bit off the gentleman's head last Cambervel vos a
      twelvemonth, and has killed on the awerage three keepers a-year ever since
      he arrived at matoority. No extra charge on this account recollect; the
      price of admission is only sixpence.' This address never fails to produce
      a considerable sensation, and sixpences flow into the treasury with
      wonderful rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwarfs are also objects of great curiosity, and as a dwarf, a
      giantess, a living skeleton, a wild Indian, 'a young lady of singular
      beauty, with perfectly white hair and pink eyes,' and two or three other
      natural curiosities, are usually exhibited together for the small charge
      of a penny, they attract very numerous audiences. The best thing about a
      dwarf is, that he has always a little box, about two feet six inches high,
      into which, by long practice, he can just manage to get, by doubling
      himself up like a boot-jack; this box is painted outside like a six-roomed
      house, and as the crowd see him ring a bell, or fire a pistol out of the
      first-floor window, they verily believe that it is his ordinary town
      residence, divided like other mansions into drawing-rooms, dining-parlour,
      and bedchambers. Shut up in this case, the unfortunate little object is
      brought out to delight the throng by holding a facetious dialogue with the
      proprietor: in the course of which, the dwarf (who is always particularly
      drunk) pledges himself to sing a comic song inside, and pays various
      compliments to the ladies, which induce them to 'come for'erd' with great
      alacrity. As a giant is not so easily moved, a pair of indescribables of
      most capacious dimensions, and a huge shoe, are usually brought out, into
      which two or three stout men get all at once, to the enthusiastic delight
      of the crowd, who are quite satisfied with the solemn assurance that these
      habiliments form part of the giant's everyday costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandest and most numerously-frequented booth in the whole fair,
      however, is 'The Crown and Anchor'-a temporary ball-room-we forget how
      many hundred feet long, the price of admission to which is one shilling.
      Immediately on your right hand as you enter, after paying your money, is a
      refreshment place, at which cold beef, roast and boiled, French rolls,
      stout, wine, tongue, ham, even fowls, if we recollect right, are displayed
      in tempting array. There is a raised orchestra, and the place is boarded
      all the way down, in patches, just wide enough for a country dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no master of the ceremonies in this artificial Eden-all is
      primitive, unreserved, and unstudied. The dust is blinding, the heat
      insupportable, the company somewhat noisy, and in the highest spirits
      possible: the ladies, in the height of their innocent animation, dancing
      in the gentlemen's hats, and the gentlemen promenading 'the gay and
      festive scene' in the ladies' bonnets, or with the more expensive
      ornaments of false noses, and low-crowned, tinder-box-looking hats:
      playing children's drums, and accompanied by ladies on the penny trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of these various instruments, the orchestra, the shouting, the
      'scratchers,' and the dancing, is perfectly bewildering. The dancing,
      itself, beggars description-every figure lasts about an hour, and the
      ladies bounce up and down the middle, with a degree of spirit which is
      quite indescribable. As to the gentlemen, they stamp their feet against
      the ground, every time 'hands four round' begins, go down the middle and
      up again, with cigars in their mouths, and silk handkerchiefs in their
      hands, and whirl their partners round, nothing loth, scrambling and
      falling, and embracing, and knocking up against the other couples, until
      they are fairly tired out, and can move no longer. The same scene is
      repeated again and again (slightly varied by an occasional 'row') until a
      late hour at night: and a great many clerks and 'prentices find themselves
      next morning with aching heads, empty pockets, damaged hats, and a very
      imperfect recollection of how it was they did not get home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII-PRIVATE THEATRES
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Richard the Third.-Duke of Glo'ster 2l.; Earl of Richmond, 1l; Duke of
      Buckingham, 15s.; Catesby, 12s.; Tressel, 10s. 6d.; Lord Stanley, 5s.;
      Lord Mayor of London, 2s. 6d.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the written placards wafered up in the gentlemen's dressing-
      room, or the green-room (where there is any), at a private theatre; and
      such are the sums extracted from the shop-till, or overcharged in the
      office expenditure, by the donkeys who are prevailed upon to pay for
      permission to exhibit their lamentable ignorance and boobyism on the stage
      of a private theatre. This they do, in proportion to the scope afforded by
      the character for the display of their imbecility. For instance, the Duke
      of Glo'ster is well worth two pounds, because he has it all to himself; he
      must wear a real sword, and what is better still, he must draw it, several
      times in the course of the piece. The soliloquies alone are well worth
      fifteen shillings; then there is the stabbing King Henry-decidedly cheap
      at three-and-sixpence, that's eighteen-and-sixpence; bullying the
      coffin-bearers-say eighteen-pence, though it's worth much more-that's a
      pound. Then the love scene with Lady Ann, and the bustle of the fourth act
      can't be dear at ten shillings more-that's only one pound ten, including
      the 'off with his head!'-which is sure to bring down the applause, and it
      is very easy to do-'Orf with his ed' (very quick and loud;-then slow and
      sneeringly)-'So much for Bu-u-u-uckingham!' Lay the emphasis on the 'uck;'
      get yourself gradually into a corner, and work with your right hand, while
      you're saying it, as if you were feeling your way, and it's sure to do.
      The tent scene is confessedly worth half-a-sovereign, and so you have the
      fight in, gratis, and everybody knows what an effect may be produced by a
      good combat. One-two-three-four-over; then, one-two-three-four-under; then
      thrust; then dodge and slide about; then fall down on one knee; then fight
      upon it, and then get up again and stagger. You may keep on doing this, as
      long as it seems to take-say ten minutes-and then fall down (backwards, if
      you can manage it without hurting yourself), and die game: nothing like it
      for producing an effect. They always do it at Astley's and Sadler's Wells,
      and if they don't know how to do this sort of thing, who in the world
      does? A small child, or a female in white, increases the interest of a
      combat materially-indeed, we are not aware that a regular legitimate
      terrific broadsword combat could be done without; but it would be rather
      difficult, and somewhat unusual, to introduce this effect in the last
      scene of Richard the Third, so the only thing to be done, is, just to make
      the best of a bad bargain, and be as long as possible fighting it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal patrons of private theatres are dirty boys, low copying-
      clerks, in attorneys' offices, capacious-headed youths from city
      counting-houses, Jews whose business, as lenders of fancy dresses, is a
      sure passport to the amateur stage, shop-boys who now and then mistake
      their masters' money for their own; and a choice miscellany of idle
      vagabonds. The proprietor of a private theatre may be an ex-scene-
      painter, a low coffee-house-keeper, a disappointed eighth-rate actor, a
      retired smuggler, or uncertificated bankrupt. The theatre itself may be in
      Catherine-street, Strand, the purlieus of the city, the neighbourhood of
      Gray's-inn-lane, or the vicinity of Sadler's Wells; or it may, perhaps,
      form the chief nuisance of some shabby street, on the Surrey side of
      Waterloo-bridge.

      The lady performers pay nothing for their characters, and it is needless
      to add, are usually selected from one class of society; the audiences are
      necessarily of much the same character as the performers, who receive, in
      return for their contributions to the management, tickets to the amount of
      the money they pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the minor theatres in London, especially the lowest, constitute the
      centre of a little stage-struck neighbourhood. Each of them has an
      audience exclusively its own; and at any you will see dropping into the
      pit at half-price, or swaggering into the back of a box, if the price of
      admission be a reduced one, divers boys of from fifteen to twenty-one
      years of age, who throw back their coat and turn up their wristbands,
      after the portraits of Count D'Orsay, hum tunes and whistle when the
      curtain is down, by way of persuading the people near them, that they are
      not at all anxious to have it up again, and speak familiarly of the
      inferior performers as Bill Such-a-one, and Ned So-and-so, or tell each
      other how a new piece called The Unknown Bandit of the Invisible Cavern,
      is in rehearsal; how Mister Palmer is to play The Unknown Bandit; how
      Charley Scarton is to take the part of an English sailor, and fight a
      broadsword combat with six unknown bandits, at one and the same time (one
      theatrical sailor is always equal to half a dozen men at least); how
      Mister Palmer and Charley Scarton are to go through a double hornpipe in
      fetters in the second act; how the interior of the invisible cavern is to
      occupy the whole extent of the stage; and other town- surprising
      theatrical announcements. These gentlemen are the amateurs-the Richards,
      Shylocks, Beverleys, and Othellos-the Young Dorntons, Rovers, Captain
      Absolutes, and Charles Surfaces-a private theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      See them at the neighbouring public-house or the theatrical coffee-shop!
      They are the kings of the place, supposing no real performers to be
      present; and roll about, hats on one side, and arms a-kimbo, as if they
      had actually come into possession of eighteen shillings a-week, and a
      share of a ticket night. If one of them does but know an Astley's
      supernumerary he is a happy fellow. The mingled air of envy and admiration
      with which his companions will regard him, as he converses familiarly with
      some mouldy-looking man in a fancy neckerchief, whose partially corked
      eyebrows, and half-rouged face, testify to the fact of his having just
      left the stage or the circle, sufficiently shows in what high admiration
      these public characters are held.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the double view of guarding against the discovery of friends or
      employers, and enhancing the interest of an assumed character, by
      attaching a high-sounding name to its representative, these geniuses
      assume fictitious names, which are not the least amusing part of the
      play-bill of a private theatre. Belville, Melville, Treville, Berkeley,
      Randolph, Byron, St. Clair, and so forth, are among the humblest; and the
      less imposing titles of Jenkins, Walker, Thomson, Barker, Solomons, &amp;c.,
      are completely laid aside. There is something imposing in this, and it is
      an excellent apology for shabbiness into the bargain. A shrunken, faded
      coat, a decayed hat, a patched and soiled pair of trousers-nay, even a
      very dirty shirt (and none of these appearances are very uncommon among
      the members of the corps dramatique), may be worn for the purpose of
      disguise, and to prevent the remotest chance of recognition. Then it
      prevents any troublesome inquiries or explanations about employment and
      pursuits; everybody is a gentleman at large, for the occasion, and there
      are none of those unpleasant and unnecessary distinctions to which even
      genius must occasionally succumb elsewhere. As to the ladies (God bless
      them), they are quite above any formal absurdities; the mere circumstance
      of your being behind the scenes is a sufficient introduction to their
      society-for of course they know that none but strictly respectable persons
      would be admitted into that close fellowship with them, which acting
      engenders. They place implicit reliance on the manager, no doubt; and as
      to the manager, he is all affability when he knows you well,-or, in other
      words, when he has pocketed your money once, and entertains confident
      hopes of doing so again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter before eight-there will be a full house to-night-six parties in
      the boxes, already; four little boys and a woman in the pit; and two
      fiddles and a flute in the orchestra, who have got through five overtures
      since seven o'clock (the hour fixed for the commencement of the
      performances), and have just begun the sixth. There will be plenty of it,
      though, when it does begin, for there is enough in the bill to last six
      hours at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman in the white hat and checked shirt, brown coat and brass
      buttons, lounging behind the stage-box on the O. P. side, is Mr. Horatio
      St. Julien, alias Jem Larkins. His line is genteel comedy-his father's,
      coal and potato. He does Alfred Highflier in the last piece, and very well
      he'll do it-at the price. The party of gentlemen in the opposite box, to
      whom he has just nodded, are friends and supporters of Mr. Beverley
      (otherwise Loggins), the Macbeth of the night. You observe their attempts
      to appear easy and gentlemanly, each member of the party, with his feet
      cocked upon the cushion in front of the box! They let them do these things
      here, upon the same humane principle which permits poor people's children
      to knock double knocks at the door of an empty house-because they can't do
      it anywhere else. The two stout men in the centre box, with an opera-glass
      ostentatiously placed before them, are friends of the proprietor-opulent
      country managers, as he confidentially informs every individual among the
      crew behind the curtain-opulent country managers looking out for recruits;
      a representation which Mr. Nathan, the dresser, who is in the manager's
      interest, and has just arrived with the costumes, offers to confirm upon
      oath if required-corroborative evidence, however, is quite unnecessary,
      for the gulls believe it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout Jewess who has just entered, is the mother of the pale, bony
      little girl, with the necklace of blue glass beads, sitting by her; she is
      being brought up to 'the profession.' Pantomime is to be her line, and she
      is coming out to-night, in a hornpipe after the tragedy. The short thin
      man beside Mr. St. Julien, whose white face is so deeply seared with the
      small-pox, and whose dirty shirt-front is inlaid with open-work, and
      embossed with coral studs like ladybirds, is the low comedian and comic
      singer of the establishment. The remainder of the audience-a tolerably
      numerous one by this time-are a motley group of dupes and blackguards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foot-lights have just made their appearance: the wicks of the six
      little oil lamps round the only tier of boxes, are being turned up, and
      the additional light thus afforded serves to show the presence of dirt,
      and absence of paint, which forms a prominent feature in the audience part
      of the house. As these preparations, however, announce the speedy
      commencement of the play, let us take a peep 'behind,' previous to the
      ringing-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little narrow passages beneath the stage are neither especially clean
      nor too brilliantly lighted; and the absence of any flooring, together
      with the damp mildewy smell which pervades the place, does not conduce in
      any great degree to their comfortable appearance. Don't fall over this
      plate basket-it's one of the 'properties'-the caldron for the witches'
      cave; and the three uncouth-looking figures, with broken clothes-props in
      their hands, who are drinking gin-and-water out of a pint pot, are the
      weird sisters. This miserable room, lighted by candles in sconces placed
      at lengthened intervals round the wall, is the dressing-room, common to
      the gentlemen performers, and the square hole in the ceiling is the
      trap-door of the stage above. You will observe that the ceiling is
      ornamented with the beams that support the boards, and tastefully hung
      with cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters in the tragedy are all dressed, and their own clothes are
      scattered in hurried confusion over the wooden dresser which surrounds the
      room. That snuff-shop-looking figure, in front of the glass, is Banquo:
      and the young lady with the liberal display of legs, who is kindly
      painting his face with a hare's foot, is dressed for Fleance. The large
      woman, who is consulting the stage directions in Cumberland's edition of
      Macbeth, is the Lady Macbeth of the night; she is always selected to play
      the part, because she is tall and stout, and looks a little like Mrs.
      Siddons-at a considerable distance. That stupid- looking milksop, with
      light hair and bow legs-a kind of man whom you can warrant town-made-is
      fresh caught; he plays Malcolm to-night, just to accustom himself to an
      audience. He will get on better by degrees; he will play Othello in a
      month, and in a month more, will very probably be apprehended on a charge
      of embezzlement. The black-eyed female with whom he is talking so
      earnestly, is dressed for the 'gentlewoman.' It is her first appearance,
      too-in that character. The boy of fourteen who is having his eyebrows
      smeared with soap and whitening, is Duncan, King of Scotland; and the two
      dirty men with the corked countenances, in very old green tunics, and
      dirty drab boots, are the 'army.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look sharp below there, gents,' exclaims the dresser, a red-headed and
      red-whiskered Jew, calling through the trap, 'they're a-going to ring up.
      The flute says he'll be blowed if he plays any more, and they're getting
      precious noisy in front.' A general rush immediately takes place to the
      half-dozen little steep steps leading to the stage, and the heterogeneous
      group are soon assembled at the side scenes, in breathless anxiety and
      motley confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' cries the manager, consulting the written list which hangs behind
      the first P. S, wing, 'Scene 1, open country-lamps down-thunder and
      lightning-all ready, White?' [This is addressed to one of the army.] 'All
      ready.'-'Very well. Scene 2, front chamber. Is the front chamber
      down?'-'Yes.'-'Very well.'-'Jones' [to the other army who is up in the
      flies]. 'Hallo!'-'Wind up the open country when we ring up.'-'I'll take
      care.'-'Scene 3, back perspective with practical bridge. Bridge ready,
      White? Got the tressels there?'-'All right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well. Clear the stage,' cries the manager, hastily packing every
      member of the company into the little space there is between the wings and
      the wall, and one wing and another. 'Places, places. Now then,
      Witches-Duncan-Malcolm-bleeding officer-where's the bleeding
      officer?'-'Here!' replies the officer, who has been rose-pinking for the
      character. 'Get ready, then; now, White, ring the second music-bell.' The
      actors who are to be discovered, are hastily arranged, and the actors who
      are not to be discovered place themselves, in their anxiety to peep at the
      house, just where the audience can see them. The bell rings, and the
      orchestra, in acknowledgment of the call, play three distinct chords. The
      bell rings-the tragedy (!) opens-and our description closes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV-VAUXHALL-GARDENS BY DAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a time when if a man ventured to wonder how Vauxhall-gardens
      would look by day, he was hailed with a shout of derision at the absurdity
      of the idea. Vauxhall by daylight! A porter-pot without porter, the House
      of Commons without the Speaker, a gas-lamp without the gas-pooh, nonsense,
      the thing was not to be thought of. It was rumoured, too, in those times,
      that Vauxhall-gardens by day, were the scene of secret and hidden
      experiments; that there, carvers were exercised in the mystic art of
      cutting a moderate-sized ham into slices thin enough to pave the whole of
      the grounds; that beneath the shade of the tall trees, studious men were
      constantly engaged in chemical experiments, with the view of discovering
      how much water a bowl of negus could possibly bear; and that in some
      retired nooks, appropriated to the study of ornithology, other sage and
      learned men were, by a process known only to themselves, incessantly
      employed in reducing fowls to a mere combination of skin and bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vague rumours of this kind, together with many others of a similar nature,
      cast over Vauxhall-gardens an air of deep mystery; and as there is a great
      deal in the mysterious, there is no doubt that to a good many people, at
      all events, the pleasure they afforded was not a little enhanced by this
      very circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this class of people we confess to having made one. We loved to wander
      among these illuminated groves, thinking of the patient and laborious
      researches which had been carried on there during the day, and witnessing
      their results in the suppers which were served up beneath the light of
      lamps and to the sound of music at night. The temples and saloons and
      cosmoramas and fountains glittered and sparkled before our eyes; the
      beauty of the lady singers and the elegant deportment of the gentlemen,
      captivated our hearts; a few hundred thousand of additional lamps dazzled
      our senses; a bowl or two of punch bewildered our brains; and we were
      happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an evil hour, the proprietors of Vauxhall-gardens took to opening them
      by day. We regretted this, as rudely and harshly disturbing that veil of
      mystery which had hung about the property for many years, and which none
      but the noonday sun, and the late Mr. Simpson, had ever penetrated. We
      shrunk from going; at this moment we scarcely know why. Perhaps a morbid
      consciousness of approaching disappointment-perhaps a fatal
      presentiment-perhaps the weather; whatever it was, we did not go until the
      second or third announcement of a race between two balloons tempted us,
      and we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      We paid our shilling at the gate, and then we saw for the first time, that
      the entrance, if there had been any magic about it at all, was now
      decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a
      combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the
      orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past-we just recognised them, and
      that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least,
      we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot
      with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower-that wooden
      shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round,
      like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had
      beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by
      flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of
      Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life
      to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the
      wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine
      her temple! That the-but at this moment the bell rung; the people
      scampered away, pell- mell, to the spot from whence the sound proceeded;
      and we, from the mere force of habit, found ourself running among the
      first, as if for very life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for the concert in the orchestra. A small party of dismal men in
      cocked hats were 'executing' the overture to Tancredi, and a numerous
      assemblage of ladies and gentlemen, with their families, had rushed from
      their half-emptied stout mugs in the supper boxes, and crowded to the
      spot. Intense was the low murmur of admiration when a particularly small
      gentleman, in a dress coat, led on a particularly tall lady in a blue
      sarcenet pelisse and bonnet of the same, ornamented with large white
      feathers, and forthwith commenced a plaintive duet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We knew the small gentleman well; we had seen a lithographed semblance of
      him, on many a piece of music, with his mouth wide open as if in the act
      of singing; a wine-glass in his hand; and a table with two decanters and
      four pine-apples on it in the background. The tall lady, too, we had gazed
      on, lost in raptures of admiration, many and many a time-how different
      people do look by daylight, and without punch, to be sure! It was a
      beautiful duet: first the small gentleman asked a question, and then the
      tall lady answered it; then the small gentleman and the tall lady sang
      together most melodiously; then the small gentleman went through a little
      piece of vehemence by himself, and got very tenor indeed, in the
      excitement of his feelings, to which the tall lady responded in a similar
      manner; then the small gentleman had a shake or two, after which the tall
      lady had the same, and then they both merged imperceptibly into the
      original air: and the band wound themselves up to a pitch of fury, and the
      small gentleman handed the tall lady out, and the applause was rapturous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comic singer, however, was the especial favourite; we really thought
      that a gentleman, with his dinner in a pocket-handkerchief, who stood near
      us, would have fainted with excess of joy. A marvellously facetious
      gentleman that comic singer is; his distinguishing characteristics are, a
      wig approaching to the flaxen, and an aged countenance, and he bears the
      name of one of the English counties, if we recollect right. He sang a very
      good song about the seven ages, the first half-hour of which afforded the
      assembly the purest delight; of the rest we can make no report, as we did
      not stay to hear any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked about, and met with a disappointment at every turn; our
      favourite views were mere patches of paint; the fountain that had sparkled
      so showily by lamp-light, presented very much the appearance of a
      water-pipe that had burst; all the ornaments were dingy, and all the walks
      gloomy. There was a spectral attempt at rope-dancing in the little open
      theatre. The sun shone upon the spangled dresses of the performers, and
      their evolutions were about as inspiriting and appropriate as a
      country-dance in a family vault. So we retraced our steps to the
      firework-ground, and mingled with the little crowd of people who were
      contemplating Mr. Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some half-dozen men were restraining the impetuosity of one of the
      balloons, which was completely filled, and had the car already attached;
      and as rumours had gone abroad that a Lord was 'going up,' the crowd were
      more than usually anxious and talkative. There was one little man in faded
      black, with a dirty face and a rusty black neckerchief with a red border,
      tied in a narrow wisp round his neck, who entered into conversation with
      everybody, and had something to say upon every remark that was made within
      his hearing. He was standing with his arms folded, staring up at the
      balloon, and every now and then vented his feelings of reverence for the
      aA
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you're very right, sir,' said another gentleman, with his wife, and
      children, and mother, and wife's sister, and a host of female friends, in
      all the gentility of white pocket-handkerchiefs, frills, and spencers,
      'Mr. Green is a steady hand, sir, and there's no fear about him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fear!' said the little man: 'isn't it a lovely thing to see him and his
      wife a going up in one balloon, and his own son and his wife a jostling up
      against them in another, and all of them going twenty or thirty mile in
      three hours or so, and then coming back in pochayses? I don't know where
      this here science is to stop, mind you; that's what bothers me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a considerable talking among the females in the spencers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the ladies a laughing at, sir?' inquired the little man,
      condescendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's only my sister Mary,' said one of the girls, 'as says she hopes his
      lordship won't be frightened when he's in the car, and want to come out
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Make yourself easy about that there, my dear,' replied the little man.
      'If he was so much as to move a inch without leave, Green would jist fetch
      him a crack over the head with the telescope, as would send him into the
      bottom of the basket in no time, and stun him till they come down again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would he, though?' inquired the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, would he,' replied the little one, 'and think nothing of it,
      neither, if he was the king himself. Green's presence of mind is
      wonderful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment all eyes were directed to the preparations which were
      being made for starting. The car was attached to the second balloon, the
      two were brought pretty close together, and a military band commenced
      playing, with a zeal and fervour which would render the most timid man in
      existence but too happy to accept any means of quitting that particular
      spot of earth on which they were stationed. Then Mr. Green, sen., and his
      noble companion entered one car, and Mr. Green, jun., and his companion
      the other; and then the balloons went up, and the arial travellers stood
      up, and the crowd outside roared with delight, and the two gentlemen who
      had never ascended before, tried to wave their flags, as if they were not
      nervous, but held on very fast all the while; and the balloons were wafted
      gently away, our little friend solemnly protesting, long after they were
      reduced to mere specks in the air, that he could still distinguish the
      white hat of Mr. Green. The gardens disgorged their multitudes, boys ran
      up and down screaming 'bal- loon;' and in all the crowded thoroughfares
      people rushed out of their shops into the middle of the road, and having
      stared up in the air at two little black objects till they almost
      dislocated their necks, walked slowly in again, perfectly satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day there was a grand account of the ascent in the morning
      papers, and the public were informed how it was the finest day but four in
      Mr. Green's remembrance; how they retained sight of the earth till they
      lost it behind the clouds; and how the reflection of the balloon on the
      undulating masses of vapour was gorgeously picturesque; together with a
      little science about the refraction of the sun's rays, and some mysterious
      hints respecting atmospheric heat and eddying currents of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also an interesting account how a man in a boat was distinctly
      heard by Mr. Green, jun., to exclaim, 'My eye!' which Mr. Green, jun.,
      attributed to his voice rising to the balloon, and the sound being thrown
      back from its surface into the car; and the whole concluded with a slight
      allusion to another ascent next Wednesday, all of which was very
      instructive and very amusing, as our readers will see if they look to the
      papers. If we have forgotten to mention the date, they have only to wait
      till next summer, and take the account of the first ascent, and it will
      answer the purpose equally well.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV-EARLY COACHES
    </h2>
    <p>
      We have often wondered how many months' incessant travelling in a post-
      chaise it would take to kill a man; and wondering by analogy, we should
      very much like to know how many months of constant travelling in a
      succession of early coaches, an unfortunate mortal could endure. Breaking
      a man alive upon the wheel, would be nothing to breaking his rest, his
      peace, his heart-everything but his fast-upon four; and the punishment of
      Ixion (the only practical person, by-the-bye, who has discovered the
      secret of the perpetual motion) would sink into utter insignificance
      before the one we have suggested. If we had been a powerful churchman in
      those good times when blood was shed as freely as water, and men were
      mowed down like grass, in the sacred cause of religion, we would have lain
      by very quietly till we got hold of some especially obstinate miscreant,
      who positively refused to be converted to our faith, and then we would
      have booked him for an inside place in a small coach, which travelled day
      and night: and securing the remainder of the places for stout men with a
      slight tendency to coughing and spitting, we would have started him forth
      on his last travels: leaving him mercilessly to all the tortures which the
      waiters, landlords, coachmen, guards, boots, chambermaids, and other
      familiars on his line of road, might think proper to inflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who has not experienced the miseries inevitably consequent upon a summons
      to undertake a hasty journey? You receive an intimation from your place of
      business-wherever that may be, or whatever you may be-that it will be
      necessary to leave town without delay. You and your family are forthwith
      thrown into a state of tremendous excitement; an express is immediately
      dispatched to the washerwoman's; everybody is in a bustle; and you,
      yourself, with a feeling of dignity which you cannot altogether conceal,
      sally forth to the booking-office to secure your place. Here a painful
      consciousness of your own unimportance first rushes on your mind-the
      people are as cool and collected as if nobody were going out of town, or
      as if a journey of a hundred odd miles were a mere nothing. You enter a
      mouldy-looking room, ornamented with large posting-bills; the greater part
      of the place enclosed behind a huge, lumbering, rough counter, and fitted
      up with recesses that look like the dens of the smaller animals in a
      travelling menagerie, without the bars. Some half-dozen people are
      'booking' brown-paper parcels, which one of the clerks flings into the
      aforesaid recesses with an air of recklessness which you, remembering the
      new carpet-bag you bought in the morning, feel considerably annoyed at;
      porters, looking like so many Atlases, keep rushing in and out, with large
      packages on their shoulders; and while you are waiting to make the
      necessary inquiries, you wonder what on earth the booking-office clerks
      can have been before they were booking-office clerks; one of them with his
      pen behind his ear, and his hands behind him, is standing in front of the
      fire, like a full-length portrait of Napoleon; the other with his hat half
      off his head, enters the passengers' names in the books with a coolness
      which is inexpressibly provoking; and the villain whistles-actually
      whistles-while a man asks him what the fare is outside, all the way to
      Holyhead!-in frosty weather, too! They are clearly an isolated race,
      evidently possessing no sympathies or feelings in common with the rest of
      mankind. Your turn comes at last, and having paid the fare, you
      tremblingly inquire-'What time will it be necessary for me to be here in
      the morning?'-'Six o'clock,' replies the whistler, carelessly pitching the
      sovereign you have just parted with, into a wooden bowl on the desk.
      'Rather before than arter,' adds the man with the semi-roasted
      unmentionables, with just as much ease and complacency as if the whole
      world got out of bed at five. You turn into the street, ruminating as you
      bend your steps homewards on the extent to which men become hardened in
      cruelty, by custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be one thing in existence more miserable than another, it most
      unquestionably is the being compelled to rise by candlelight. If you have
      ever doubted the fact, you are painfully convinced of your error, on the
      morning of your departure. You left strict orders, overnight, to be called
      at half-past four, and you have done nothing all night but doze for five
      minutes at a time, and start up suddenly from a terrific dream of a large
      church-clock with the small hand running round, with astonishing rapidity,
      to every figure on the dial-plate. At last, completely exhausted, you fall
      gradually into a refreshing sleep-your thoughts grow confused-the
      stage-coaches, which have been 'going off' before your eyes all night,
      become less and less distinct, until they go off altogether; one moment
      you are driving with all the skill and smartness of an experienced
      whip-the next you are exhibiting A la Ducrow, on the off-leader; anon you
      are closely muffled up, inside, and have just recognised in the person of
      the guard an old schoolfellow, whose funeral, even in your dream, you
      remember to have attended eighteen years ago. At last you fall into a
      state of complete oblivion, from which you are aroused, as if into a new
      state of existence, by a singular illusion. You are apprenticed to a
      trunk-maker; how, or why, or when, or wherefore, you don't take the
      trouble to inquire; but there you are, pasting the lining in the lid of a
      portmanteau. Confound that other apprentice in the back shop, how he is
      hammering!-rap, rap, rap-what an industrious fellow he must be! you have
      heard him at work for half an hour past, and he has been hammering
      incessantly the whole time. Rap, rap, rap, again-he's talking now-what's
      that he said? Five o'clock! You make a violent exertion, and start up in
      bed. The vision is at once dispelled; the trunk-maker's shop is your own
      bedroom, and the other apprentice your shivering servant, who has been
      vainly endeavouring to wake you for the last quarter of an hour, at the
      imminent risk of breaking either his own knuckles or the panels of the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      You proceed to dress yourself, with all possible dispatch. The flaring
      flat candle with the long snuff, gives light enough to show that the
      things you want, are not where they ought to be, and you undergo a
      trifling delay in consequence of having carefully packed up one of your
      boots in your over-anxiety of the preceding night. You soon complete your
      toilet, however, for you are not particular on such an occasion, and you
      shaved yesterday evening; so mounting your Petersham great-coat, and green
      travelling shawl, and grasping your carpet-bag in your right hand, you
      walk lightly down-stairs, lest you should awaken any of the family, and
      after pausing in the common sitting-room for one moment, just to have a
      cup of coffee (the said common sitting-room looking remarkably
      comfortable, with everything out of its place, and strewed with the crumbs
      of last night's supper), you undo the chain and bolts of the street-door,
      and find yourself fairly in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thaw, by all that is miserable! The frost is completely broken up. You
      look down the long perspective of Oxford-street, the gas-lights mournfully
      reflected on the wet pavement, and can discern no speck in the road to
      encourage the belief that there is a cab or a coach to be had-the very
      coachmen have gone home in despair. The cold sleet is drizzling down with
      that gentle regularity, which betokens a duration of four-and-twenty hours
      at least; the damp hangs upon the house-tops and lamp-posts, and clings to
      you like an invisible cloak. The water is 'coming in' in every area, the
      pipes have burst, the water-butts are running over; the kennels seem to be
      doing matches against time, pump- handles descend of their own accord,
      horses in market-carts fall down, and there's no one to help them up
      again, policemen look as if they had been carefully sprinkled with
      powdered glass; here and there a milk- woman trudges slowly along, with a
      bit of list round each foot to keep her from slipping; boys who 'don't
      sleep in the house,' and are not allowed much sleep out of it, can't wake
      their masters by thundering at the shop-door, and cry with the cold-the
      compound of ice, snow, and water on the pavement, is a couple of inches
      thick-nobody ventures to walk fast to keep himself warm, and nobody could
      succeed in keeping himself warm if he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      It strikes a quarter past five as you trudge down Waterloo-place on your
      way to the Golden Cross, and you discover, for the first time, that you
      were called about an hour too early. You have not time to go back; there
      is no place open to go into, and you have, therefore, no resource but to
      go forward, which you do, feeling remarkably satisfied with yourself, and
      everything about you. You arrive at the office, and look wistfully up the
      yard for the Birmingham High-flier, which, for aught you can see, may have
      flown away altogether, for preparations appear to be on foot for the
      departure of any vehicle in the shape of a coach. You wander into the
      booking-office, which with the gas-lights and blazing fire, looks quite
      comfortable by contrast-that is to say, if any place can look comfortable
      at half-past five on a winter's morning. There stands the identical
      book-keeper in the same position as if he had not moved since you saw him
      yesterday. As he informs you, that the coach is up the yard, and will be
      brought round in about a quarter of an hour, you leave your bag, and
      repair to 'The Tap'-not with any absurd idea of warming yourself, because
      you feel such a result to be utterly hopeless, but for the purpose of
      procuring some hot brandy-and-water, which you do,-when the kettle boils!
      an event which occurs exactly two minutes and a half before the time fixed
      for the starting of the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first stroke of six, peals from St. Martin's church steeple, just as
      you take the first sip of the boiling liquid. You find yourself at the
      booking-office in two seconds, and the tap-waiter finds himself much
      comforted by your brandy-and-water, in about the same period. The coach is
      out; the horses are in, and the guard and two or three porters, are
      stowing the luggage away, and running up the steps of the booking- office,
      and down the steps of the booking-office, with breathless rapidity. The
      place, which a few minutes ago was so still and quiet, is now all bustle;
      the early vendors of the morning papers have arrived, and you are assailed
      on all sides with shouts of 'Times, gen'lm'n, Times,' 'Here's
      Chron-Chron-Chron,' 'Herald, ma'am,' 'Highly interesting murder,
      gen'lm'n,' 'Curious case o' breach o' promise, ladies.' The inside
      passengers are already in their dens, and the outsides, with the exception
      of yourself, are pacing up and down the pavement to keep themselves warm;
      they consist of two young men with very long hair, to which the sleet has
      communicated the appearance of crystallised rats' tails; one thin young
      woman cold and peevish, one old gentleman ditto ditto, and something in a
      cloak and cap, intended to represent a military officer; every member of
      the party, with a large stiff shawl over his chin, looking exactly as if
      he were playing a set of Pan's pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take off the cloths, Bob,' says the coachman, who now appears for the
      first time, in a rough blue great-coat, of which the buttons behind are so
      far apart, that you can't see them both at the same time. 'Now, gen'lm'n,'
      cries the guard, with the waybill in his hand. 'Five minutes behind time
      already!' Up jump the passengers-the two young men smoking like
      lime-kilns, and the old gentleman grumbling audibly. The thin young woman
      is got upon the roof, by dint of a great deal of pulling, and pushing, and
      helping and trouble, and she repays it by expressing her solemn conviction
      that she will never be able to get down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right,' sings out the guard at last, jumping up as the coach starts,
      and blowing his horn directly afterwards, in proof of the soundness of his
      wind. 'Let 'em go, Harry, give 'em their heads,' cries the coachman-and
      off we start as briskly as if the morning were 'all right,' as well as the
      coach: and looking forward as anxiously to the termination of our journey,
      as we fear our readers will have done, long since, to the conclusion of
      our paper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI-OMNIBUSES
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is very generally allowed that public conveyances afford an extensive
      field for amusement and observation. Of all the public conveyances that
      have been constructed since the days of the Ark-we think that is the
      earliest on record-to the present time, commend us to an omnibus. A long
      stage is not to be despised, but there you have only six insides, and the
      chances are, that the same people go all the way with you-there is no
      change, no variety. Besides, after the first twelve hours or so, people
      get cross and sleepy, and when you have seen a man in his nightcap, you
      lose all respect for him; at least, that is the case with us. Then on
      smooth roads people frequently get prosy, and tell long stories, and even
      those who don't talk, may have very unpleasant predilections. We once
      travelled four hundred miles, inside a stage- coach, with a stout man, who
      had a glass of rum-and-water, warm, handed in at the window at every place
      where we changed horses. This was decidedly unpleasant. We have also
      travelled occasionally, with a small boy of a pale aspect, with light
      hair, and no perceptible neck, coming up to town from school under the
      protection of the guard, and directed to be left at the Cross Keys till
      called for. This is, perhaps, even worse than rum-and-water in a close
      atmosphere. Then there is the whole train of evils consequent on a change
      of the coachman; and the misery of the discovery-which the guard is sure
      to make the moment you begin to doze-that he wants a brown-paper parcel,
      which he distinctly remembers to have deposited under the seat on which
      you are reposing. A great deal of bustle and groping takes place, and when
      you are thoroughly awakened, and severely cramped, by holding your legs up
      by an almost supernatural exertion, while he is looking behind them, it
      suddenly occurs to him that he put it in the fore-boot. Bang goes the
      door; the parcel is immediately found; off starts the coach again; and the
      guard plays the key-bugle as loud as he can play it, as if in mockery of
      your wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you meet with none of these afflictions in an omnibus; sameness there
      can never be. The passengers change as often in the course of one journey
      as the figures in a kaleidoscope, and though not so glittering, are far
      more amusing. We believe there is no instance on record, of a man's having
      gone to sleep in one of these vehicles. As to long stories, would any man
      venture to tell a long story in an omnibus? and even if he did, where
      would be the harm? nobody could possibly hear what he was talking about.
      Again; children, though occasionally, are not often to be found in an
      omnibus; and even when they are, if the vehicle be full, as is generally
      the case, somebody sits upon them, and we are unconscious of their
      presence. Yes, after mature reflection, and considerable experience, we
      are decidedly of opinion, that of all known vehicles, from the glass-coach
      in which we were taken to be christened, to that sombre caravan in which
      we must one day make our last earthly journey, there is nothing like an
      omnibus.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will back the machine in which we make our daily peregrination from the
      top of Oxford-street to the city, against any 'buss' on the road, whether
      it be for the gaudiness of its exterior, the perfect simplicity of its
      interior, or the native coolness of its cad. This young gentleman is a
      singular instance of self-devotion; his somewhat intemperate zeal on
      behalf of his employers, is constantly getting him into trouble, and
      occasionally into the house of correction. He is no sooner emancipated,
      however, than he resumes the duties of his profession with unabated
      ardour. His principal distinction is his activity. His great boast is,
      'that he can chuck an old gen'lm'n into the buss, shut him in, and rattle
      off, afore he knows where it's a-going to'-a feat which he frequently
      performs, to the infinite amusement of every one but the old gentleman
      concerned, who, somehow or other, never can see the joke of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not aware that it has ever been precisely ascertained, how many
      passengers our omnibus will contain. The impression on the cad's mind
      evidently is, that it is amply sufficient for the accommodation of any
      number of persons that can be enticed into it. 'Any room?' cries a hot
      pedestrian. 'Plenty o' room, sir,' replies the conductor, gradually
      opening the door, and not disclosing the real state of the case, until the
      wretched man is on the steps. 'Where?' inquires the entrapped individual,
      with an attempt to back out again. 'Either side, sir,' rejoins the cad,
      shoving him in, and slamming the door. 'All right, Bill.' Retreat is
      impossible; the new-comer rolls about, till he falls down somewhere, and
      there he stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we get into the city a little before ten, four or five of our party are
      regular passengers. We always take them up at the same places, and they
      generally occupy the same seats; they are always dressed in the same
      manner, and invariably discuss the same topics-the increasing rapidity of
      cabs, and the disregard of moral obligations evinced by omnibus men. There
      is a little testy old man, with a powdered head, who always sits on the
      right-hand side of the door as you enter, with his hands folded on the top
      of his umbrella. He is extremely impatient, and sits there for the purpose
      of keeping a sharp eye on the cad, with whom he generally holds a running
      dialogue. He is very officious in helping people in and out, and always
      volunteers to give the cad a poke with his umbrella, when any one wants to
      alight. He usually recommends ladies to have sixpence ready, to prevent
      delay; and if anybody puts a window down, that he can reach, he
      immediately puts it up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, what are you stopping for?' says the little man every morning, the
      moment there is the slightest indication of 'pulling up' at the corner of
      Regent-street, when some such dialogue as the following takes place
      between him and the cad:
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you stopping for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the cad whistles, and affects not to hear the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say [a poke], what are you stopping for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For passengers, sir. Ba-nk.-Ty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know you're stopping for passengers; but you've no business to do so.
      Why are you stopping?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Vy, sir, that's a difficult question. I think it is because we perfer
      stopping here to going on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now mind,' exclaims the little old man, with great vehemence, 'I'll pull
      you up to-morrow; I've often threatened to do it; now I will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thankee, sir,' replies the cad, touching his hat with a mock expression
      of gratitude;-'werry much obliged to you indeed, sir.' Here the young men
      in the omnibus laugh very heartily, and the old gentleman gets very red in
      the face, and seems highly exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout gentleman in the white neckcloth, at the other end of the
      vehicle, looks very prophetic, and says that something must shortly be
      done with these fellows, or there's no saying where all this will end; and
      the shabby-genteel man with the green bag, expresses his entire
      concurrence in the opinion, as he has done regularly every morning for the
      last six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second omnibus now comes up, and stops immediately behind us. Another
      old gentleman elevates his cane in the air, and runs with all his might
      towards our omnibus; we watch his progress with great interest; the door
      is opened to receive him, he suddenly disappears-he has been spirited away
      by the opposition. Hereupon the driver of the opposition taunts our people
      with his having 'regularly done 'em out of that old swell,' and the voice
      of the 'old swell' is heard, vainly protesting against this unlawful
      detention. We rattle off, the other omnibus rattles after us, and every
      time we stop to take up a passenger, they stop to take him too; sometimes
      we get him; sometimes they get him; but whoever don't get him, say they
      ought to have had him, and the cads of the respective vehicles abuse one
      another accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we arrive in the vicinity of Lincoln's-inn-fields, Bedford-row, and
      other legal haunts, we drop a great many of our original passengers, and
      take up fresh ones, who meet with a very sulky reception. It is rather
      remarkable, that the people already in an omnibus, always look at
      newcomers, as if they entertained some undefined idea that they have no
      business to come in at all. We are quite persuaded the little old man has
      some notion of this kind, and that he considers their entry as a sort of
      negative impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation is now entirely dropped; each person gazes vacantly through
      the window in front of him, and everybody thinks that his opposite
      neighbour is staring at him. If one man gets out at Shoe-lane, and another
      at the corner of Farringdon-street, the little old gentleman grumbles, and
      suggests to the latter, that if he had got out at Shoe- lane too, he would
      have saved them the delay of another stoppage; whereupon the young men
      laugh again, and the old gentleman looks very solemn, and says nothing
      more till he gets to the Bank, when he trots off as fast as he can,
      leaving us to do the same, and to wish, as we walk away, that we could
      impart to others any portion of the amusement we have gained for
      ourselves.

    <p>
      Of all the cabriolet-drivers whom we have ever had the honour and
      gratification of knowing by sight-and our acquaintance in this way has
      been most extensive-there is one who made an impression on our mind which
      can never be effaced, and who awakened in our bosom a feeling of
      admiration and respect, which we entertain a fatal presentiment will never
      be called forth again by any human being. He was a man of most simple and
      prepossessing appearance. He was a brown-whiskered, white- hatted,
      no-coated cabman; his nose was generally red, and his bright blue eye not
      unfrequently stood out in bold relief against a black border of artificial
      workmanship; his boots were of the Wellington form, pulled up to meet his
      corduroy knee-smalls, or at least to approach as near them as their
      dimensions would admit of; and his neck was usually garnished with a
      bright yellow handkerchief. In summer he carried in his mouth a flower; in
      winter, a straw-slight, but, to a contemplative mind, certain indications
      of a love of nature, and a taste for botany.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cabriolet was gorgeously painted-a bright red; and wherever we went,
      City or West End, Paddington or Holloway, North, East, West, or South,
      there was the red cab, bumping up against the posts at the street corners,
      and turning in and out, among hackney-coaches, and drays, and carts, and
      waggons, and omnibuses, and contriving by some strange means or other, to
      get out of places which no other vehicle but the red cab could ever by any
      possibility have contrived to get into at all. Our fondness for that red
      cab was unbounded. How we should have liked to have seen it in the circle
      at Astley's! Our life upon it, that it should have performed such
      evolutions as would have put the whole company to shame-Indian chiefs,
      knights, Swiss peasants, and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people object to the exertion of getting into cabs, and others object
      to the difficulty of getting out of them; we think both these are
      objections which take their rise in perverse and ill-conditioned minds.
      The getting into a cab is a very pretty and graceful process, which, when
      well performed, is essentially melodramatic. First, there is the
      expressive pantomime of every one of the eighteen cabmen on the stand, the
      moment you raise your eyes from the ground. Then there is your own
      pantomime in reply-quite a little ballet. Four cabs immediately leave the
      stand, for your especial accommodation; and the evolutions of the animals
      who draw them, are beautiful in the extreme, as they grate the wheels of
      the cabs against the curb-stones, and sport playfully in the kennel. You
      single out a particular cab, and dart swiftly towards it. One bound, and
      you are on the first step; turn your body lightly round to the right, and
      you are on the second; bend gracefully beneath the reins, working round to
      the left at the same time, and you are in the cab. There is no difficulty
      in finding a seat: the apron knocks you comfortably into it at once, and
      off you go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The getting out of a cab is, perhaps, rather more complicated in its
      theory, and a shade more difficult in its execution. We have studied the
      subject a great deal, and we think the best way is, to throw yourself out,
      and trust to chance for alighting on your feet. If you make the driver
      alight first, and then throw yourself upon him, you will find that he
      breaks your fall materially. In the event of your contemplating an offer
      of eightpence, on no account make the tender, or show the money, until you
      are safely on the pavement. It is very bad policy attempting to save the
      fourpence. You are very much in the power of a cabman, and he considers it
      a kind of fee not to do you any wilful damage. Any instruction, however,
      in the art of getting out of a cab, is wholly unnecessary if you are going
      any distance, because the probability is, that you will be shot lightly
      out before you have completed the third mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not aware of any instance on record in which a cab-horse has
      performed three consecutive miles without going down once. What of that?
      It is all excitement. And in these days of derangement of the nervous
      system and universal lassitude, people are content to pay handsomely for
      excitement; where can it be procured at a cheaper rate?
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to the red cab; it was omnipresent. You had but to walk down
      Holborn, or Fleet-street, or any of the principal thoroughfares in which
      there is a great deal of traffic, and judge for yourself. You had hardly
      turned into the street, when you saw a trunk or two, lying on the ground:
      an uprooted post, a hat-box, a portmanteau, and a carpet-bag, strewed
      about in a very picturesque manner: a horse in a cab standing by, looking
      about him with great unconcern; and a crowd, shouting and screaming with
      delight, cooling their flushed faces against the glass windows of a
      chemist's shop.-'What's the matter here, can you tell me?'-'O'ny a cab,
      sir.'-'Anybody hurt, do you know?'-'O'ny the fare, sir. I see him a
      turnin' the corner, and I ses to another gen'lm'n "that's a reg'lar little
      oss that, and he's a comin' along rayther sweet, an't he?"-"He just is,"
      ses the other gen'lm'n, ven bump they cums agin the post, and out flies
      the fare like bricks.' Need we say it was the red cab; or that the
      gentleman with the straw in his mouth, who emerged so coolly from the
      chemist's shop and philosophically climbing into the little dickey,
      started off at full gallop, was the red cab's licensed driver?
    </p>
    <p>
      The ubiquity of this red cab, and the influence it exercised over the
      risible muscles of justice itself, was perfectly astonishing. You walked
      into the justice-room of the Mansion-house; the whole court resounded with
      merriment. The Lord Mayor threw himself back in his chair, in a state of
      frantic delight at his own joke; every vein in Mr. Hobler's countenance
      was swollen with laughter, partly at the Lord Mayor's facetiousness, but
      more at his own; the constables and police- officers were (as in duty
      bound) in ecstasies at Mr. Hobler and the Lord Mayor combined; and the
      very paupers, glancing respectfully at the beadle's countenance, tried to
      smile, as even he relaxed. A tall, weazen-faced man, with an impediment in
      his speech, would be endeavouring to state a case of imposition against
      the red cab's driver; and the red cab's driver, and the Lord Mayor, and
      Mr. Hobler, would be having a little fun among themselves, to the
      inordinate delight of everybody but the complainant. In the end, justice
      would be so tickled with the red cab-driver's native humour, that the fine
      would be mitigated, and he would go away full gallop, in the red cab, to
      impose on somebody else without loss of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver of the red cab, confident in the strength of his own moral
      principles, like many other philosophers, was wont to set the feelings and
      opinions of society at complete defiance. Generally speaking, perhaps, he
      would as soon carry a fare safely to his destination, as he would upset
      him-sooner, perhaps, because in that case he not only got the money, but
      had the additional amusement of running a longer heat against some smart
      rival. But society made war upon him in the shape of penalties, and he
      must make war upon society in his own way. This was the reasoning of the
      red cab-driver. So, he bestowed a searching look upon the fare, as he put
      his hand in his waistcoat pocket, when he had gone half the mile, to get
      the money ready; and if he brought forth eightpence, out he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time we saw our friend was one wet evening in Tottenham-court-
      road, when he was engaged in a very warm and somewhat personal altercation
      with a loquacious little gentleman in a green coat. Poor fellow! there
      were great excuses to be made for him: he had not received above
      eighteenpence more than his fare, and consequently laboured under a great
      deal of very natural indignation. The dispute had attained a pretty
      considerable height, when at last the loquacious little gentleman, making
      a mental calculation of the distance, and finding that he had already paid
      more than he ought, avowed his unalterable determination to 'pull up' the
      cabman in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, just mark this, young man,' said the little gentleman, 'I'll pull
      you up to-morrow morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! will you though?' said our friend, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' replied the little gentleman, 'mark my words, that's all. If I
      live till to-morrow morning, you shall repent this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a steadiness of purpose, and indignation of speech, about the
      little gentleman, as he took an angry pinch of snuff, after this last
      declaration, which made a visible impression on the mind of the red cab-
      driver. He appeared to hesitate for an instant. It was only for an
      instant; his resolve was soon taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll pull me up, will you?' said our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' rejoined the little gentleman, with even greater vehemence an
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' said our friend, tucking up his shirt sleeves very calmly.
      'There'll be three veeks for that. Wery good; that'll bring me up to the
      middle o' next month. Three veeks more would carry me on to my birthday,
      and then I've got ten pound to draw. I may as well get board, lodgin', and
      washin', till then, out of the county, as pay for it myself; consequently
      here goes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      So, without more ado, the red cab-driver knocked the little gentleman
      down, and then called the police to take himself into custody, with all
      the civility in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A story is nothing without the sequel; and therefore, we may state, that
      to our certain knowledge, the board, lodging, and washing were all
      provided in due course. We happen to know the fact, for it came to our
      knowledge thus: We went over the House of Correction for the county of
      Middlesex shortly after, to witness the operation of the silent system;
      and looked on all the 'wheels' with the greatest anxiety, in search of our
      long-lost friend. He was nowhere to be seen, however, and we began to
      think that the little gentleman in the green coat must have relented,
      when, as we were traversing the kitchen-garden, which lies in a
      sequestered part of the prison, we were startled by hearing a voice, which
      apparently proceeded from the wall, pouring forth its soul in the
      plaintive air of 'All round my hat,' which was then just beginning to form
      a recognised portion of our national music.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started.-'What voice is that?' said we. The Governor shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sad fellow,' he replied, 'very sad. He positively refused to work on the
      wheel; so, after many trials, I was compelled to order him into solitary
      confinement. He says he likes it very much though, and I am afraid he
      does, for he lies on his back on the floor, and sings comic songs all
      day!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall we add, that our heart had not deceived us and that the comic singer
      was no other than our eagerly-sought friend, the red cab-driver?
    </p>
    <p>
      We have never seen him since, but we have strong reason to suspect that
      this noble individual was a distant relative of a waterman of our
      acquaintance, who, on one occasion, when we were passing the coach-stand
      over which he presides, after standing very quietly to see a tall man
      struggle into a cab, ran up very briskly when it was all over (as his
      brethren invariably do), and, touching his hat, asked, as a matter of
      course, for 'a copper for the waterman.' Now, the fare was by no means a
      handsome man; and, waxing very indignant at the demand, he replied-'Money!
      What for? Coming up and looking at me, I suppose!'-'Vell, sir,' rejoined
      the waterman, with a smile of immovable complacency, 'that's worth
      twopence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The identical waterman afterwards attained a very prominent station in
      society; and as we know something of his life, and have often thought of
      telling what we do know, perhaps we shall never have a better opportunity
      than the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. William Barker, then, for that was the gentleman's name, Mr. William
      Barker was born-but why need we relate where Mr. William Barker was born,
      or when? Why scrutinise the entries in parochial ledgers, or seek to
      penetrate the Lucinian mysteries of lying-in hospitals? Mr. William Barker
      was born, or he had never been. There is a son-there was a father. There
      is an effect-there was a cause. Surely this is sufficient information for
      the most Fatima-like curiosity; and, if it be not, we regret our inability
      to supply any further evidence on the point. Can there be a more
      satisfactory, or more strictly parliamentary course? Impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We at once avow a similar inability to record at what precise period, or
      by what particular process, this gentleman's patronymic, of William
      Barker, became corrupted into 'Bill Boorker.' Mr. Barker acquired a high
      standing, and no inconsiderable reputation, among the members of that
      profession to which he more peculiarly devoted his energies; and to them
      he was generally known, either by the familiar appellation of 'Bill
      Boorker,' or the flattering designation of 'Aggerawatin Bill,' the latter
      being a playful and expressive sobriquet, illustrative of Mr. Barker's
      great talent in 'aggerawatin' and rendering wild such subjects of her
      Majesty as are conveyed from place to place, through the instrumentality
      of omnibuses. Of the early life of Mr. Barker little is known, and even
      that little is involved in considerable doubt and obscurity. A want of
      application, a restlessness of purpose, a thirsting after porter, a love
      of all that is roving and cadger-like in nature, shared in common with
      many other great geniuses, appear to have been his leading
      characteristics. The busy hum of a parochial free- school, and the shady
      repose of a county gaol, were alike inefficacious in producing the
      slightest alteration in Mr. Barker's disposition. His feverish attachment
      to change and variety nothing could repress; his native daring no
      punishment could subdue.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Barker can be fairly said to have had any weakness in his earlier
      years, it was an amiable one-love; love in its most comprehensive form-a
      love of ladies, liquids, and pocket-handkerchiefs. It was no selfish
      feeling; it was not confined to his own possessions, which but too many
      men regard with exclusive complacency. No; it was a nobler love-a general
      principle. It extended itself with equal force to the property of other
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something very affecting in this. It is still more affecting to
      know, that such philanthropy is but imperfectly rewarded. Bow- street,
      Newgate, and Millbank, are a poor return for general benevolence, evincing
      itself in an irrepressible love for all created objects. Mr. Barker felt
      it so. After a lengthened interview with the highest legal authorities, he
      quitted his ungrateful country, with the consent, and at the expense, of
      its Government; proceeded to a distant shore; and there employed himself,
      like another Cincinnatus, in clearing and cultivating the soil-a peaceful
      pursuit, in which a term of seven years glided almost imperceptibly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether, at the expiration of the period we have just mentioned, the
      British Government required Mr. Barker's presence here, or did not require
      his residence abroad, we have no distinct means of ascertaining. We should
      be inclined, however, to favour the latter position, inasmuch as we do not
      find that he was advanced to any other public post on his return, than the
      post at the corner of the Haymarket, where he officiated as
      assistant-waterman to the hackney-coach stand. Seated, in this capacity,
      on a couple of tubs near the curbstone, with a brass plate and number
      suspended round his neck by a massive chain, and his ankles curiously
      enveloped in haybands, he is supposed to have made those observations on
      human nature which exercised so material an influence over all his
      proceedings in later life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barker had not officiated for many months in this capacity, when the
      appearance of the first omnibus caused the public mind to go in a new
      direction, and prevented a great many hackney-coaches from going in any
      direction at all. The genius of Mr. Barker at once perceived the whole
      extent of the injury that would be eventually inflicted on cab and coach
      stands, and, by consequence, on watermen also, by the progress of the
      system of which the first omnibus was a part. He saw, too, the necessity
      of adopting some more profitable profession; and his active mind at once
      perceived how much might be done in the way of enticing the youthful and
      unwary, and shoving the old and helpless, into the wrong buss, and
      carrying them off, until, reduced to despair, they ransomed themselves by
      the payment of sixpence a-head, or, to adopt his own figurative expression
      in all its native beauty, 'till they was rig'larly done over, and forked
      out the stumpy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      An opportunity for realising his fondest anticipations, soon presented
      itself. Rumours were rife on the hackney-coach stands, that a buss was
      building, to run from Lisson-grove to the Bank, down Oxford-street and
      Holborn; and the rapid increase of busses on the Paddington-road,
      encouraged the idea. Mr. Barker secretly and cautiously inquired in the
      proper quarters. The report was correct; the 'Royal William' was to make
      its first journey on the following Monday. It was a crack affair
      altogether. An enterprising young cabman, of established reputation as a
      dashing whip-for he had compromised with the parents of three scrunched
      children, and just 'worked out' his fine for knocking down an old lady-was
      the driver; and the spirited proprietor, knowing Mr. Barker's
      qualifications, appointed him to the vacant office of cad on the very
      first application. The buss began to run, and Mr. Barker entered into a
      new suit of clothes, and on a new sphere of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      To recapitulate all the improvements introduced by this extraordinary man
      into the omnibus system-gradually, indeed, but surely-would occupy a far
      greater space than we are enabled to devote to this imperfect memoir. To
      him is universally assigned the original suggestion of the practice which
      afterwards became so general-of the driver of a second buss keeping
      constantly behind the first one, and driving the pole of his vehicle
      either into the door of the other, every time it was opened, or through
      the body of any lady or gentleman who might make an attempt to get into
      it; a humorous and pleasant invention, exhibiting all that originality of
      idea, and fine, bold flow of spirits, so conspicuous in every action of
      this great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barker had opponents of course; what man in public life has not? But
      even his worst enemies cannot deny that he has taken more old ladies and
      gentlemen to Paddington who wanted to go to the Bank, and more old ladies
      and gentlemen to the Bank who wanted to go to Paddington, than any six men
      on the road; and however much malevolent spirits may pretend to doubt the
      accuracy of the statement, they well know it to be an established fact,
      that he has forcibly conveyed a variety of ancient persons of either sex,
      to both places, who had not the slightest or most distant intention of
      going anywhere at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barker was the identical cad who nobly distinguished himself, some
      time since, by keeping a tradesman on the step-the omnibus going at full
      speed all the time-till he had thrashed him to his entire satisfaction,
      and finally throwing him away, when he had quite done with him. Mr. Barker
      it ought to have been, who honestly indignant at being ignominiously
      ejected from a house of public entertainment, kicked the landlord in the
      knee, and thereby caused his death. We say it ought to have been Mr.
      Barker, because the action was not a common one, and could have emanated
      from no ordinary mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has now become matter of history; it is recorded in the Newgate
      Calendar; and we wish we could attribute this piece of daring heroism to
      Mr. Barker. We regret being compelled to state that it was not performed
      by him. Would, for the family credit we could add, that it was achieved by
      his brother!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the exercise of the nicer details of his profession, that Mr.
      Barker's knowledge of human nature was beautifully displayed. He could
      tell at a glance where a passenger wanted to go to, and would shout the
      name of the place accordingly, without the slightest reference to the real
      destination of the vehicle. He knew exactly the kind of old lady that
      would be too much flurried by the process of pushing in and pulling out of
      the caravan, to discover where she had been put down, until too late; had
      an intuitive perception of what was passing in a passenger's mind when he
      inwardly resolved to 'pull that cad up to-morrow morning;' and never
      failed to make himself agreeable to female servants, whom he would place
      next the door, and talk to all the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human judgment is never infallible, and it would occasionally happen that
      Mr. Barker experimentalised with the timidity or forbearance of the wrong
      person, in which case a summons to a Police-office, was, on more than one
      occasion, followed by a committal to prison. It was not in the power of
      trifles such as these, however, to subdue the freedom of his spirit. As
      soon as they passed away, he resumed the duties of his profession with
      unabated ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have spoken of Mr. Barker and of the red cab-driver, in the past tense.
      Alas! Mr. Barker has again become an absentee; and the class of men to
      which they both belonged is fast disappearing. Improvement has peered
      beneath the aprons of our cabs, and penetrated to the very innermost
      recesses of our omnibuses. Dirt and fustian will vanish before cleanliness
      and livery. Slang will be forgotten when civility becomes general: and
      that enlightened, eloquent, sage, and profound body, the Magistracy of
      London, will be deprived of half their amusement, and half their
      occupation.

      CHAPTER XVIII-A PARLIAMENTARY SKETCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      We hope our readers will not be alarmed at this rather ominous title. We
      assure them that we are not about to become political, neither have we the
      slightest intention of being more prosy than usual-if we can help it. It
      has occurred to us that a slight sketch of the general aspect of 'the
      House,' and the crowds that resort to it on the night of an important
      debate, would be productive of some amusement: and as we have made some
      few calls at the aforesaid house in our time-have visited it quite often
      enough for our purpose, and a great deal too often for our personal peace
      and comfort-we have determined to attempt the description. Dismissing from
      our minds, therefore, all that feeling of awe, which vague ideas of
      breaches of privilege, Serjeant-at-Arms, heavy denunciations, and still
      heavier fees, are calculated to awaken, we enter at once into the
      building, and upon our subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past four o'clock-and at five the mover of the Address will be 'on
      his legs,' as the newspapers announce sometimes by way of novelty, as if
      speakers were occasionally in the habit of standing on their heads. The
      members are pouring in, one after the other, in shoals. The few spectators
      who can obtain standing-room in the passages, scrutinise them as they
      pass, with the utmost interest, and the man who can identify a member
      occasionally, becomes a person of great importance. Every now and then you
      hear earnest whispers of 'That's Sir John Thomson.' 'Which? him with the
      gilt order round his neck?' 'No, no; that's one of the messengers-that
      other with the yellow gloves, is Sir John Thomson.' 'Here's Mr. Smith.'
      'Lor!' 'Yes, how d'ye do, sir?-(He is our new member)-How do you do, sir?'
      Mr. Smith stops: turns round with an air of enchanting urbanity (for the
      rumour of an intended dissolution has been very extensively circulated
      this morning); seizes both the hands of his gratified constituent, and,
      after greeting him with the most enthusiastic warmth, darts into the lobby
      with an extraordinary display of ardour in the public cause, leaving an
      immense impression in his favour on the mind of his 'fellow-townsman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrivals increase in number, and the heat and noise increase in very
      unpleasant proportion. The livery servants form a complete lane on either
      side of the passage, and you reduce yourself into the smallest possible
      space to avoid being turned out. You see that stout man with the hoarse
      voice, in the blue coat, queer-crowned, broad-brimmed hat, white corduroy
      breeches, and great boots, who has been talking incessantly for half an
      hour past, and whose importance has occasioned no small quantity of mirth
      among the strangers. That is the great conservator of the peace of
      Westminster. You cannot fail to have remarked the grace with which he
      saluted the noble Lord who passed just now, or the excessive dignity of
      his air, as he expostulates with the crowd. He is rather out of temper
      now, in consequence of the very irreverent behaviour of those two young
      fellows behind him, who have done nothing but laugh all the time they have
      been here.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will they divide to-night, do you think, Mr. &mdash;-' timidly inquires a
      little thin man in the crowd, hoping to conciliate the man of office.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can you ask such questions, sir?' replies the functionary, in an
      incredibly loud key, and pettishly grasping the thick stick he carries in
      his right hand. 'Pray do not, sir. I beg of you; pray do not, sir.' The
      little man looks remarkably out of his element, and the uninitiated part
      of the throng are in positive convulsions of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment some unfortunate individual appears, with a very
      smirking air, at the bottom of the long passage. He has managed to elude
      the vigilance of the special constable downstairs, and is evidently
      congratulating himself on having made his way so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go back, sir-you must not come here,' shouts the hoarse one, with
      tremendous emphasis of voice and gesture, the moment the offender catches
      his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you hear, sir-will you go back?' continues the official dignitary,
      gently pushing the intruder some half-dozen yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, don't push me,' replies the stranger, turning angrily round.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You won't, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go out, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take your hands off me, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go out of the passage, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're a Jack-in-office, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A what?' ejaculates he of the boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A Jack-in-office, sir, and a very insolent fellow,' reiterates the
      stranger, now completely in a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray do not force me to put you out, sir,' retorts the other-'pray do
      not-my instructions are to keep this passage clear-it's the Speaker's
      orders, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'D-n the Speaker, sir!' shouts the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here, Wilson!-Collins!' gasps the officer, actually paralysed at this
      insulting expression, which in his mind is all but high treason; 'take
      this man out-take him out, I say! How dare you, sir?' and down goes the
      unfortunate man five stairs at a time, turning round at every stoppage, to
      come back again, and denouncing bitter vengeance against the
      commander-in-chief, and all his supernumeraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Make way, gentlemen,-pray make way for the Members, I beg of you!' shouts
      the zealous officer, turning back, and preceding a whole string of the
      liberal and independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see this ferocious-looking gentleman, with a complexion almost as
      sallow as his linen, and whose large black moustache would give him the
      appearance of a figure in a hairdresser's window, if his countenance
      possessed the thought which is communicated to those waxen caricatures of
      the human face divine. He is a militia-officer, and the most amusing
      person in the House. Can anything be more exquisitely absurd than the
      burlesque grandeur of his air, as he strides up to the lobby, his eyes
      rolling like those of a Turk's head in a cheap Dutch clock? He never
      appears without that bundle of dirty papers which he carries under his
      left arm, and which are generally supposed to be the miscellaneous
      estimates for 1804, or some equally important documents. He is very
      punctual in his attendance at the House, and his self-satisfied 'He-ar-
      He-ar,' is not unfrequently the signal for a general titter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the gentleman who once actually sent a messenger up to the
      Strangers' gallery in the old House of Commons, to inquire the name of an
      individual who was using an eye-glass, in order that he might complain to
      the Speaker that the person in question was quizzing him! On another
      occasion, he is reported to have repaired to Bellamy's kitchen-a
      refreshment-room, where persons who are not Members are admitted on
      sufferance, as it were-and perceiving two or three gentlemen at supper,
      who, he was aware, were not Members, and could not, in that place, very
      well resent his behaviour, he indulged in the pleasantry of sitting with
      his booted leg on the table at which they were supping! He is generally
      harmless, though, and always amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of patience, and some little interest with our friend the
      constable, we have contrived to make our way to the Lobby, and you can
      just manage to catch an occasional glimpse of the House, as the door is
      opened for the admission of Members. It is tolerably full already, and
      little groups of Members are congregated together here, discussing the
      interesting topics of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      That smart-looking fellow in the black coat with velvet facings and cuffs,
      who wears his D'Orsay hat so rakishly, is 'Honest Tom,' a metropolitan
      representative; and the large man in the cloak with the white lining-not
      the man by the pillar; the other with the light hair hanging over his coat
      collar behind-is his colleague. The quiet gentlemanly-looking man in the
      blue surtout, gray trousers, white neckerchief and gloves, whose
      closely-buttoned coat displays his manly figure and broad chest to great
      advantage, is a very well-known character. He has fought a great many
      battles in his time, and conquered like the heroes of old, with no other
      arms than those the gods gave him. The old hard-featured man who is
      standing near him, is really a good specimen of a class of men, now nearly
      extinct. He is a county Member, and has been from time whereof the memory
      of man is not to the contrary. Look at his loose, wide, brown coat, with
      capacious pockets on each side; the knee-breeches and boots, the immensely
      long waistcoat, and silver watch-chain dangling below it, the wide-brimmed
      brown hat, and the white handkerchief tied in a great bow, with straggling
      ends sticking out beyond his shirt-frill. It is a costume one seldom sees
      nowadays, and when the few who wear it have died off, it will be quite
      extinct. He can tell you long stories of Fox, Pitt, Sheridan, and Canning,
      and how much better the House was managed in those times, when they used
      to get up at eight or nine o'clock, except on regular field- days, of
      which everybody was apprised beforehand. He has a great contempt for all
      young Members of Parliament, and thinks it quite impossible that a man can
      say anything worth hearing, unless he has sat in the House for fifteen
      years at least, without saying anything at all. He is of opinion that
      'that young Macaulay' was a regular impostor; he allows, that Lord Stanley
      may do something one of these days, but 'he's too young, sir-too young.'
      He is an excellent authority on points of precedent, and when he grows
      talkative, after his wine, will tell you how Sir Somebody Something, when
      he was whipper-in for the Government, brought four men out of their beds
      to vote in the majority, three of whom died on their way home again; how
      the House once divided on the question, that fresh candles be now brought
      in; how the Speaker was once upon a time left in the chair by accident, at
      the conclusion of business, and was obliged to sit in the House by himself
      for three hours, till some Member could be knocked up and brought back
      again, to move the adjournment; and a great many other anecdotes of a
      similar description.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he stands, leaning on his stick; looking at the throng of Exquisites
      around him with most profound contempt; and conjuring up, before his
      mind's eye, the scenes he beheld in the old House, in days gone by, when
      his own feelings were fresher and brighter, and when, as he imagines, wit,
      talent, and patriotism flourished more brightly too.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are curious to know who that young man in the rough great-coat is, who
      has accosted every Member who has entered the House since we have been
      standing here. He is not a Member; he is only an 'hereditary bondsman,'
      or, in other words, an Irish correspondent of an Irish newspaper, who has
      just procured his forty-second frank from a Member whom he never saw in
      his life before. There he goes again-another! Bless the man, he has his
      hat and pockets full already.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will try our fortune at the Strangers' gallery, though the nature of
      the debate encourages very little hope of success. What on earth are you
      about? Holding up your order as if it were a talisman at whose command the
      wicket would fly open? Nonsense. Just preserve the order for an autograph,
      if it be worth keeping at all, and make your appearance at the door with
      your thumb and forefinger expressively inserted in your waistcoat-pocket.
      This tall stout man in black is the door-keeper. 'Any room?' 'Not an
      inch-two or three dozen gentlemen waiting down-stairs on the chance of
      somebody's going out.' Pull out your purse-'Are you quite sure there's no
      room?'-'I'll go and look,' replies the door-keeper, with a wistful glance
      at your purse, 'but I'm afraid there's not.' He returns, and with real
      feeling assures you that it is morally impossible to get near the gallery.
      It is of no use waiting. When you are refused admission into the
      Strangers' gallery at the House of Commons, under such circumstances, you
      may return home thoroughly satisfied that the place must be remarkably
      full indeed. <a href="#linknote-122" id="linknoteref-122"><small>122</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Retracing our steps through the long passage, descending the stairs, and
      crossing Palace-yard, we halt at a small temporary doorway adjoining the
      King's entrance to the House of Lords. The order of the serjeant-at- arms
      will admit you into the Reporters' gallery, from whence you can obtain a
      tolerably good view of the House. Take care of the stairs, they are none
      of the best; through this little wicket-there. As soon as your eyes become
      a little used to the mist of the place, and the glare of the chandeliers
      below you, you will see that some unimportant personage on the Ministerial
      side of the House (to your right hand) is speaking, amidst a hum of voices
      and confusion which would rival Babel, but for the circumstance of its
      being all in one language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'hear, hear,' which occasioned that laugh, proceeded from our warlike
      friend with the moustache; he is sitting on the back seat against the
      wall, behind the Member who is speaking, looking as ferocious and
      intellectual as usual. Take one look around you, and retire! The body of
      the House and the side galleries are full of Members; some, with their
      legs on the back of the opposite seat; some, with theirs stretched out to
      their utmost length on the floor; some going out, others coming in; all
      talking, laughing, lounging, coughing, oh-ing, questioning, or groaning;
      presenting a conglomeration of noise and confusion, to be met with in no
      other place in existence, not even excepting Smithfield on a market-day,
      or a cock-pit in its glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us not omit to notice Bellamy's kitchen, or, in other words, the
      refreshment-room, common to both Houses of Parliament, where
      Ministerialists and Oppositionists, Whigs and Tories, Radicals, Peers, and
      Destructives, strangers from the gallery, and the more favoured strangers
      from below the bar, are alike at liberty to resort; where divers
      honourable members prove their perfect independence by remaining during
      the whole of a heavy debate, solacing themselves with the creature
      comforts; and whence they are summoned by whippers-in, when the House is
      on the point of dividing; either to give their 'conscientious votes' on
      questions of which they are conscientiously innocent of knowing anything
      whatever, or to find a vent for the playful exuberance of their
      wine-inspired fancies, in boisterous shouts of 'Divide,' occasionally
      varied with a little howling, barking, crowing, or other ebullitions of
      senatorial pleasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have ascended the narrow staircase which, in the present
      temporary House of Commons, leads to the place we are describing, you will
      probably observe a couple of rooms on your right hand, with tables spread
      for dining. Neither of these is the kitchen, although they are both
      devoted to the same purpose; the kitchen is further on to our left, up
      these half-dozen stairs. Before we ascend the staircase, however, we must
      request you to pause in front of this little bar-place with the
      sash-windows; and beg your particular attention to the steady, honest-
      looking old fellow in black, who is its sole occupant. Nicholas (we do not
      mind mentioning the old fellow's name, for if Nicholas be not a public
      man, who is?-and public men's names are public property)-Nicholas is the
      butler of Bellamy's, and has held the same place, dressed exactly in the
      same manner, and said precisely the same things, ever since the oldest of
      its present visitors can remember. An excellent servant Nicholas is-an
      unrivalled compounder of salad-dressing-an admirable preparer of
      soda-water and lemon-a special mixer of cold grog and punch-and, above
      all, an unequalled judge of cheese. If the old man have such a thing as
      vanity in his composition, this is certainly his pride; and if it be
      possible to imagine that anything in this world could disturb his
      impenetrable calmness, we should say it would be the doubting his judgment
      on this important point.
    </p>
    <p>
      We needn't tell you all this, however, for if you have an atom of
      observation, one glance at his sleek, knowing-looking head and face-his
      prim white neckerchief, with the wooden tie into which it has been
      regularly folded for twenty years past, merging by imperceptible degrees
      into a small-plaited shirt-frill-and his comfortable-looking form encased
      in a well-brushed suit of black-would give you a better idea of his real
      character than a column of our poor description could convey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas is rather out of his element now; he cannot see the kitchen as he
      used to in the old House; there, one window of his glass-case opened into
      the room, and then, for the edification and behoof of more juvenile
      questioners, he would stand for an hour together, answering deferential
      questions about Sheridan, and Percival, and Castlereagh, and Heaven knows
      who beside, with manifest delight, always inserting a 'Mister' before
      every commoner's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas, like all men of his age and standing, has a great idea of the
      degeneracy of the times. He seldom expresses any political opinions, but
      we managed to ascertain, just before the passing of the Reform Bill, that
      Nicholas was a thorough Reformer. What was our astonishment to discover
      shortly after the meeting of the first reformed Parliament, that he was a
      most inveterate and decided Tory! It was very odd: some men change their
      opinions from necessity, others from expediency, others from inspiration;
      but that Nicholas should undergo any change in any respect, was an event
      we had never contemplated, and should have considered impossible. His
      strong opinion against the clause which empowered the metropolitan
      districts to return Members to Parliament, too, was perfectly
      unaccountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We discovered the secret at last; the metropolitan Members always dined at
      home. The rascals! As for giving additional Members to Ireland, it was
      even worse-decidedly unconstitutional. Why, sir, an Irish Member would go
      up there, and eat more dinner than three English Members put together. He
      took no wine; drank table-beer by the half-gallon; and went home to
      Manchester-buildings, or Millbank-street, for his whiskey- and-water. And
      what was the consequence? Why, the concern lost-actually lost, sir-by his
      patronage. A queer old fellow is Nicholas, and as completely a part of the
      building as the house itself. We wonder he ever left the old place, and
      fully expected to see in the papers, the morning after the fire, a
      pathetic account of an old gentleman in black, of decent appearance, who
      was seen at one of the upper windows when the flames were at their height,
      and declared his resolute intention of falling with the floor. He must
      have been got out by force. However, he was got out-here he is again,
      looking as he always does, as if he had been in a bandbox ever since the
      last session. There he is, at his old post every night, just as we have
      described him: and, as characters are scarce, and faithful servants
      scarcer, long may he be there, say we!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when you have taken your seat in the kitchen, and duly noticed the
      large fire and roasting-jack at one end of the room-the little table for
      washing glasses and draining jugs at the other-the clock over the window
      opposite St. Margaret's Church-the deal tables and wax candles-the damask
      table-cloths and bare floor-the plate and china on the tables, and the
      gridiron on the fire; and a few other anomalies peculiar to the place-we
      will point out to your notice two or three of the people present, whose
      station or absurdities render them the most worthy of remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is half-past twelve o'clock, and as the division is not expected for an
      hour or two, a few Members are lounging away the time here in preference
      to standing at the bar of the House, or sleeping in one of the side
      galleries. That singularly awkward and ungainly-looking man, in the
      brownish-white hat, with the straggling black trousers which reach about
      half-way down the leg of his boots, who is leaning against the
      meat-screen, apparently deluding himself into the belief that he is
      thinking about something, is a splendid sample of a Member of the House of
      Commons concentrating in his own person the wisdom of a constituency.
      Observe the wig, of a dark hue but indescribable colour, for if it be
      naturally brown, it has acquired a black tint by long service, and if it
      be naturally black, the same cause has imparted to it a tinge of rusty
      brown; and remark how very materially the great blinker-like spectacles
      assist the expression of that most intelligent face. Seriously speaking,
      did you ever see a countenance so expressive of the most hopeless extreme
      of heavy dulness, or behold a form so strangely put together? He is no
      great speaker: but when he does address the House, the effect is
      absolutely irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small gentleman with the sharp nose, who has just saluted him, is a
      Member of Parliament, an ex-Alderman, and a sort of amateur fireman. He,
      and the celebrated fireman's dog, were observed to be remarkably active at
      the conflagration of the two Houses of Parliament-they both ran up and
      down, and in and out, getting under people's feet, and into everybody's
      way, fully impressed with the belief that they were doing a great deal of
      good, and barking tremendously. The dog went quietly back to his kennel
      with the engine, but the gentleman kept up such an incessant noise for
      some weeks after the occurrence, that he became a positive nuisance. As no
      more parliamentary fires have occurred, however, and as he has
      consequently had no more opportunities of writing to the newspapers to
      relate how, by way of preserving pictures he cut them out of their frames,
      and performed other great national services, he has gradually relapsed
      into his old state of calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That female in black-not the one whom the Lord's-Day-Bill Baronet has just
      chucked under the chin; the shorter of the two-is 'Jane:' the Hebe of
      Bellamy's. Jane is as great a character as Nicholas, in her way. Her
      leading features are a thorough contempt for the great majority of her
      visitors; her predominant quality, love of admiration, as you cannot fail
      to observe, if you mark the glee with which she listens to something the
      young Member near her mutters somewhat unintelligibly in her ear (for his
      speech is rather thick from some cause or other), and how playfully she
      digs the handle of a fork into the arm with which he detains her, by way
      of reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane is no bad hand at repartees, and showers them about, with a degree of
      liberality and total absence of reserve or constraint, which occasionally
      excites no small amazement in the minds of strangers. She cuts jokes with
      Nicholas, too, but looks up to him with a great deal of respect-the
      immovable stolidity with which Nicholas receives the aforesaid jokes, and
      looks on, at certain pastoral friskings and rompings (Jane's only
      recreations, and they are very innocent too) which occasionally take place
      in the passage, is not the least amusing part of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two persons who are seated at the table in the corner, at the farther
      end of the room, have been constant guests here, for many years past; and
      one of them has feasted within these walls, many a time, with the most
      brilliant characters of a brilliant period. He has gone up to the other
      House since then; the greater part of his boon companions have shared
      Yorick's fate, and his visits to Bellamy's are comparatively few.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he really be eating his supper now, at what hour can he possibly have
      dined! A second solid mass of rump-steak has disappeared, and he eat the
      first in four minutes and three quarters, by the clock over the window.
      Was there ever such a personification of Falstaff! Mark the air with which
      he gloats over that Stilton, as he removes the napkin which has been
      placed beneath his chin to catch the superfluous gravy of the steak, and
      with what gusto he imbibes the porter which has been fetched, expressly
      for him, in the pewter pot. Listen to the hoarse sound of that voice, kept
      down as it is by layers of solids, and deep draughts of rich wine, and
      tell us if you ever saw such a perfect picture of a regular gourmand; and
      whether he is not exactly the man whom you would pitch upon as having been
      the partner of Sheridan's parliamentary carouses, the volunteer driver of
      the hackney-coach that took him home, and the involuntary upsetter of the
      whole party?
    </p>
    <p>
      What an amusing contrast between his voice and appearance, and that of the
      spare, squeaking old man, who sits at the same table, and who, elevating a
      little cracked bantam sort of voice to its highest pitch, invokes
      damnation upon his own eyes or somebody else's at the commencement of
      every sentence he utters. 'The Captain,' as they call him, is a very old
      frequenter of Bellamy's; much addicted to stopping 'after the House is up'
      (an inexpiable crime in Jane's eyes), and a complete walking reservoir of
      spirits and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Peer-or rather, the old man-for his peerage is of comparatively
      recent date-has a huge tumbler of hot punch brought him; and the other
      damns and drinks, and drinks and damns, and smokes. Members arrive every
      moment in a great bustle to report that 'The Chancellor of the Exchequer's
      up,' and to get glasses of brandy-and-water to sustain them during the
      division; people who have ordered supper, countermand it, and prepare to
      go down-stairs, when suddenly a bell is heard to ring with tremendous
      violence, and a cry of 'Di-vi-sion!' is heard in the passage. This is
      enough; away rush the members pell-mell. The room is cleared in an
      instant; the noise rapidly dies away; you hear the creaking of the last
      boot on the last stair, and are left alone with the leviathan of
      rump-steaks.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX-PUBLIC DINNERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      All public dinners in London, from the Lord Mayor's annual banquet at
      Guildhall, to the Chimney-sweepers' anniversary at White Conduit House;
      from the Goldsmiths' to the Butchers', from the Sheriffs' to the Licensed
      Victuallers'; are amusing scenes. Of all entertainments of this
      description, however, we think the annual dinner of some public charity is
      the most amusing. At a Company's dinner, the people are nearly all
      alike-regular old stagers, who make it a matter of business, and a thing
      not to be laughed at. At a political dinner, everybody is disagreeable,
      and inclined to speechify-much the same thing, by-the-bye; but at a
      charity dinner you see people of all sorts, kinds, and descriptions. The
      wine may not be remarkably special, to be sure, and we have heard some
      hardhearted monsters grumble at the collection; but we really think the
      amusement to be derived from the occasion, sufficient to counterbalance
      even these disadvantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us suppose you are induced to attend a dinner of this
      description-'Indigent Orphans' Friends' Benevolent Institution,' we think
      it is. The name of the charity is a line or two longer, but never mind the
      rest. You have a distinct recollection, however, that you purchased a
      ticket at the solicitation of some charitable friend: and you deposit
      yourself in a hackney-coach, the driver of which-no doubt that you may do
      the thing in style-turns a deaf ear to your earnest entreaties to be set
      down at the corner of Great Queen-street, and persists in carrying you to
      the very door of the Freemasons', round which a crowd of people are
      assembled to witness the entrance of the indigent orphans' friends. You
      hear great speculations as you pay the fare, on the possibility of your
      being the noble Lord who is announced to fill the chair on the occasion,
      and are highly gratified to hear it eventually decided that you are only a
      'wocalist.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that strikes you, on your entrance, is the astonishing
      importance of the committee. You observe a door on the first landing,
      carefully guarded by two waiters, in and out of which stout gentlemen with
      very red faces keep running, with a degree of speed highly unbecoming the
      gravity of persons of their years and corpulency. You pause, quite alarmed
      at the bustle, and thinking, in your innocence, that two or three people
      must have been carried out of the dining-room in fits, at least. You are
      immediately undeceived by the waiter-'Up- stairs, if you please, sir; this
      is the committee-room.' Up-stairs you go, accordingly; wondering, as you
      mount, what the duties of the committee can be, and whether they ever do
      anything beyond confusing each other, and running over the waiters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having deposited your hat and cloak, and received a remarkably small scrap
      of pasteboard in exchange (which, as a matter of course, you lose, before
      you require it again), you enter the hall, down which there are three long
      tables for the less distinguished guests, with a cross table on a raised
      platform at the upper end for the reception of the very particular friends
      of the indigent orphans. Being fortunate enough to find a plate without
      anybody's card in it, you wisely seat yourself at once, and have a little
      leisure to look about you. Waiters, with wine- baskets in their hands, are
      placing decanters of sherry down the tables, at very respectable
      distances; melancholy-looking salt-cellars, and decayed vinegar-cruets,
      which might have belonged to the parents of the indigent orphans in their
      time, are scattered at distant intervals on the cloth; and the knives and
      forks look as if they had done duty at every public dinner in London since
      the accession of George the First. The musicians are scraping and grating
      and screwing tremendously-playing no notes but notes of preparation; and
      several gentlemen are gliding along the sides of the tables, looking into
      plate after plate with frantic eagerness, the expression of their
      countenances growing more and more dismal as they meet with everybody's
      card but their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      You turn round to take a look at the table behind you, and-not being in
      the habit of attending public dinners-are somewhat struck by the
      appearance of the party on which your eyes rest. One of its principal
      members appears to be a little man, with a long and rather inflamed face,
      and gray hair brushed bolt upright in front; he wears a wisp of black silk
      round his neck, without any stiffener, as an apology for a neckerchief,
      and is addressed by his companions by the familiar appellation of 'Fitz,'
      or some such monosyllable. Near him is a stout man in a white neckerchief
      and buff waistcoat, with shining dark hair, cut very short in front, and a
      great, round, healthy-looking face, on which he studiously preserves a
      half sentimental simper. Next him, again, is a large-headed man, with
      black hair and bushy whiskers; and opposite them are two or three others,
      one of whom is a little round- faced person, in a dress-stock and blue
      under-waistcoat. There is something peculiar in their air and manner,
      though you could hardly describe what it is; you cannot divest yourself of
      the idea that they have come for some other purpose than mere eating and
      drinking. You have no time to debate the matter, however, for the waiters
      (who have been arranged in lines down the room, placing the dishes on
      table) retire to the lower end; the dark man in the blue coat and bright
      buttons, who has the direction of the music, looks up to the gallery, and
      calls out 'band' in a very loud voice; out burst the orchestra, up rise
      the visitors, in march fourteen stewards, each with a long wand in his
      hand, like the evil genius in a pantomime; then the chairman, then the
      titled visitors; they all make their way up the room, as fast as they can,
      bowing, and smiling, and smirking, and looking remarkably amiable. The
      applause ceases, grace is said, the clatter of plates and dishes begins;
      and every one appears highly gratified, either with the presence of the
      distinguished visitors, or the commencement of the anxiously-expected
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the dinner itself-the mere dinner-it goes off much the same
      everywhere. Tureens of soup are emptied with awful rapidity-waiters take
      plates of turbot away, to get lobster-sauce, and bring back plates of
      lobster-sauce without turbot; people who can carve poultry, are great
      fools if they own it, and people who can't have no wish to learn. The
      knives and forks form a pleasing accompaniment to Auber's music, and
      Auber's music would form a pleasing accompaniment to the dinner, if you
      could hear anything besides the cymbals. The substantials disappear-moulds
      of jelly vanish like lightning-hearty eaters wipe their foreheads, and
      appear rather overcome by their recent exertions-people who have looked
      very cross hitherto, become remarkably bland, and ask you to take wine in
      the most friendly manner possible-old gentlemen direct your attention to
      the ladies' gallery, and take great pains to impress you with the fact
      that the charity is always peculiarly favoured in this respect-every one
      appears disposed to become talkative-and the hum of conversation is loud
      and general.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray, silence, gentlemen, if you please, for Non nobis!' shouts the
      toast-master with stentorian lungs-a toast-master's shirt-front,
      waistcoat, and neckerchief, by-the-bye, always exhibit three distinct
      shades of cloudy-white.-'Pray, silence, gentlemen, for Non nobis!' The
      singers, whom you discover to be no other than the very party that excited
      your curiosity at first, after 'pitching' their voices immediately begin
      too-tooing most dismally, on which the regular old stagers burst into
      occasional cries of-'Sh-Sh-waiters!-Silence, waiters-stand still,
      waiters-keep back, waiters,' and other exorcisms, delivered in a tone of
      indignant remonstrance. The grace is soon concluded, and the company
      resume their seats. The uninitiated portion of the guests applaud Non
      nobis as vehemently as if it were a capital comic song, greatly to the
      scandal and indignation of the regular diners, who immediately attempt to
      quell this sacrilegious approbation, by cries of 'Hush, hush!' whereupon
      the others, mistaking these sounds for hisses, applaud more tumultuously
      than before, and, by way of placing their approval beyond the possibility
      of doubt, shout 'Encore!' most vociferously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the noise ceases, up starts the toast-master:-'Gentlemen,
      charge your glasses, if you please!' Decanters having been handed about,
      and glasses filled, the toast-master proceeds, in a regular ascending
      scale:-'Gentlemen-air-you-all charged? Pray-silence-gentlemen-for-the
      cha-i-r!' The chairman rises, and, after stating that he feels it quite
      unnecessary to preface the toast he is about to propose, with any
      observations whatever, wanders into a maze of sentences, and flounders
      about in the most extraordinary manner, presenting a lamentable spectacle
      of mystified humanity, until he arrives at the words, 'constitutional
      sovereign of these realms,' at which elderly gentlemen exclaim 'Bravo!'
      and hammer the table tremendously with their knife-handles. 'Under any
      circumstances, it would give him the greatest pride, it would give him the
      greatest pleasure-he might almost say, it would afford him satisfaction
      [cheers] to propose that toast. What must be his feelings, then, when he
      has the gratification of announcing, that he has received her Majesty's
      commands to apply to the Treasurer of her Majesty's Household, for her
      Majesty's annual donation of 25l. in aid of the funds of this charity!'
      This announcement (which has been regularly made by every chairman, since
      the first foundation of the charity, forty-two years ago) calls forth the
      most vociferous applause; the toast is drunk with a great deal of cheering
      and knocking; and 'God save the Queen' is sung by the 'professional
      gentlemen;' the unprofessional gentlemen joining in the chorus, and giving
      the national anthem an effect which the newspapers, with great justice,
      describe as 'perfectly electrical.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The other 'loyal and patriotic' toasts having been drunk with all due
      enthusiasm, a comic song having been well sung by the gentleman with the
      small neckerchief, and a sentimental one by the second of the party, we
      come to the most important toast of the evening-'Prosperity to the
      charity.' Here again we are compelled to adopt newspaper phraseology, and
      to express our regret at being 'precluded from giving even the substance
      of the noble lord's observations.' Suffice it to say, that the speech,
      which is somewhat of the longest, is rapturously received; and the toast
      having been drunk, the stewards (looking more important than ever) leave
      the room, and presently return, heading a procession of indigent orphans,
      boys and girls, who walk round the room, curtseying, and bowing, and
      treading on each other's heels, and looking very much as if they would
      like a glass of wine apiece, to the high gratification of the company
      generally, and especially of the lady patronesses in the gallery. Exeunt
      children, and re-enter stewards, each with a blue plate in his hand. The
      band plays a lively air; the majority of the company put their hands in
      their pockets and look rather serious; and the noise of sovereigns,
      rattling on crockery, is heard from all parts of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short interval, occupied in singing and toasting, the secretary
      puts on his spectacles, and proceeds to read the report and list of
      subscriptions, the latter being listened to with great attention. 'Mr.
      Smith, one guinea-Mr. Tompkins, one guinea-Mr. Wilson, one guinea-Mr.
      Hickson, one guinea-Mr. Nixon, one guinea-Mr. Charles Nixon, one
      guinea-[hear, hear!]-Mr. James Nixon, one guinea-Mr. Thomas Nixon, one
      pound one [tremendous applause]. Lord Fitz Binkle, the chairman of the
      day, in addition to an annual donation of fifteen pounds-thirty guineas
      [prolonged knocking: several gentlemen knock the stems off their wine-
      glasses, in the vehemence of their approbation]. Lady, Fitz Binkle, in
      addition to an annual donation of ten pound-twenty pound' [protracted
      knocking and shouts of 'Bravo!'] The list being at length concluded, the
      chairman rises, and proposes the health of the secretary, than whom he
      knows no more zealous or estimable individual. The secretary, in returning
      thanks, observes that he knows no more excellent individual than the
      chairman-except the senior officer of the charity, whose health he begs to
      propose. The senior officer, in returning thanks, observes that he knows
      no more worthy man than the secretary-except Mr. Walker, the auditor,
      whose health he begs to propose. Mr. Walker, in returning thanks,
      discovers some other estimable individual, to whom alone the senior
      officer is inferior-and so they go on toasting and lauding and thanking:
      the only other toast of importance being 'The Lady Patronesses now
      present!' on which all the gentlemen turn their faces towards the ladies'
      gallery, shouting tremendously; and little priggish men, who have imbibed
      more wine than usual, kiss their hands and exhibit distressing contortions
      of visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have protracted our dinner to so great a length, that we have hardly
      time to add one word by way of grace. We can only entreat our readers not
      to imagine, because we have attempted to extract some amusement from a
      charity dinner, that we are at all disposed to underrate, either the
      excellence of the benevolent institutions with which London abounds, or
      the estimable motives of those who support them.

      CHAPTER XX-THE FIRST OF MAY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      'Now ladies, up in the sky-parlour: only once a year, if you please!'
    </h3>
    <p>
      Young Lady with Brass Ladle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sweep-sweep-sw-e-ep!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Illegal Watchword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of May! There is a merry freshness in the sound, calling to our
      minds a thousand thoughts of all that is pleasant in nature and beautiful
      in her most delightful form. What man is there, over whose mind a bright
      spring morning does not exercise a magic influence-carrying him back to
      the days of his childish sports, and conjuring up before him the old green
      field with its gently-waving trees, where the birds sang as he has never
      heard them since-where the butterfly fluttered far more gaily than he ever
      sees him now, in all his ramblings-where the sky seemed bluer, and the sun
      shone more brightly-where the air blew more freshly over greener grass,
      and sweeter-smelling flowers-where everything wore a richer and more
      brilliant hue than it is ever dressed in now! Such are the deep feelings
      of childhood, and such are the impressions which every lovely object
      stamps upon its heart! The hardy traveller wanders through the maze of
      thick and pathless woods, where the sun's rays never shone, and heaven's
      pure air never played; he stands on the brink of the roaring waterfall,
      and, giddy and bewildered, watches the foaming mass as it leaps from stone
      to stone, and from crag to crag; he lingers in the fertile plains of a
      land of perpetual sunshine, and revels in the luxury of their balmy
      breath. But what are the deep forests, or the thundering waters, or the
      richest landscapes that bounteous nature ever spread, to charm the eyes,
      and captivate the senses of man, compared with the recollection of the old
      scenes of his early youth? Magic scenes indeed; for the fancies of
      childhood dressed them in colours brighter than the rainbow, and almost as
      fleeting!
    </p>
    <p>
      In former times, spring brought with it not only such associations as
      these, connected with the past, but sports and games for the present-merry
      dances round rustic pillars, adorned with emblems of the season, and
      reared in honour of its coming. Where are they now! Pillars we have, but
      they are no longer rustic ones; and as to dancers, they are used to rooms,
      and lights, and would not show well in the open air. Think of the
      immorality, too! What would your sabbath enthusiasts say, to an
      aristocratic ring encircling the Duke of York's column in
      Carlton-terrace-a grand poussette of the middle classes, round Alderman
      Waithman's monument in Fleet-street,-or a general hands-four-round of
      ten-pound householders, at the foot of the Obelisk in St. George's-
      fields? Alas! romance can make no head against the riot act; and pastoral
      simplicity is not understood by the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well; many years ago we began to be a steady and matter-of-fact sort of
      people, and dancing in spring being beneath our dignity, we gave it up,
      and in course of time it descended to the sweeps-a fall certainly,
      because, though sweeps are very good fellows in their way, and moreover
      very useful in a civilised community, they are not exactly the sort of
      people to give the tone to the little elegances of society. The sweeps,
      however, got the dancing to themselves, and they kept it up, and handed it
      down. This was a severe blow to the romance of spring-time, but, it did
      not entirely destroy it, either; for a portion of it descended to the
      sweeps with the dancing, and rendered them objects of great interest. A
      mystery hung over the sweeps in those days. Legends were in existence of
      wealthy gentlemen who had lost children, and who, after many years of
      sorrow and suffering, had found them in the character of sweeps. Stories
      were related of a young boy who, having been stolen from his parents in
      his infancy, and devoted to the occupation of chimney-sweeping, was sent,
      in the course of his professional career, to sweep the chimney of his
      mother's bedroom; and how, being hot and tired when he came out of the
      chimney, he got into the bed he had so often slept in as an infant, and
      was discovered and recognised therein by his mother, who once every year
      of her life, thereafter, requested the pleasure of the company of every
      London sweep, at half-past one o'clock, to roast beef, plum-pudding,
      porter, and sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such stories as these, and there were many such, threw an air of mystery
      round the sweeps, and produced for them some of those good effects which
      animals derive from the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. No one
      (except the masters) thought of ill-treating a sweep, because no one knew
      who he might be, or what nobleman's or gentleman's son he might turn out.
      Chimney-sweeping was, by many believers in the marvellous, considered as a
      sort of probationary term, at an earlier or later period of which, divers
      young noblemen were to come into possession of their rank and titles: and
      the profession was held by them in great respect accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We remember, in our young days, a little sweep about our own age, with
      curly hair and white teeth, whom we devoutly and sincerely believed to be
      the lost son and heir of some illustrious personage-an impression which
      was resolved into an unchangeable conviction on our infant mind, by the
      subject of our speculations informing us, one day, in reply to our
      question, propounded a few moments before his ascent to the summit of the
      kitchen chimney, 'that he believed he'd been born in the vurkis, but he'd
      never know'd his father.' We felt certain, from that time forth, that he
      would one day be owned by a lord: and we never heard the church-bells
      ring, or saw a flag hoisted in the neighbourhood, without thinking that
      the happy event had at last occurred, and that his long- lost parent had
      arrived in a coach and six, to take him home to Grosvenor-square. He never
      came, however; and, at the present moment, the young gentleman in question
      is settled down as a master sweep in the neighbourhood of Battle-bridge,
      his distinguishing characteristics being a decided antipathy to washing
      himself, and the possession of a pair of legs very inadequate to the
      support of his unwieldy and corpulent body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The romance of spring having gone out before our time, we were fain to
      console ourselves as we best could with the uncertainty that enveloped the
      birth and parentage of its attendant dancers, the sweeps; and we did
      console ourselves with it, for many years. But, even this wicked source of
      comfort received a shock from which it has never recovered-a shock which
      has been in reality its death-blow. We could not disguise from ourselves
      the fact that whole families of sweeps were regularly born of sweeps, in
      the rural districts of Somers Town and Camden Town-that the eldest son
      succeeded to the father's business, that the other branches assisted him
      therein, and commenced on their own account; that their children again,
      were educated to the profession; and that about their identity there could
      be no mistake whatever. We could not be blind, we say, to this melancholy
      truth, but we could not bring ourselves to admit it, nevertheless, and we
      lived on for some years in a state of voluntary ignorance. We were roused
      from our pleasant slumber by certain dark insinuations thrown out by a
      friend of ours, to the effect that children in the lower ranks of life
      were beginning to choose chimney-sweeping as their particular walk; that
      applications had been made by various boys to the constituted authorities,
      to allow them to pursue the object of their ambition with the full
      concurrence and sanction of the law; that the affair, in short, was
      becoming one of mere legal contract. We turned a deaf ear to these rumours
      at first, but slowly and surely they stole upon us. Month after month,
      week after week, nay, day after day, at last, did we meet with accounts of
      similar applications. The veil was removed, all mystery was at an end, and
      chimney-sweeping had become a favourite and chosen pursuit. There is no
      longer any occasion to steal boys; for boys flock in crowds to bind
      themselves. The romance of the trade has fled, and the chimney-sweeper of
      the present day, is no more like unto him of thirty years ago, than is a
      Fleet-street pickpocket to a Spanish brigand, or Paul Pry to Caleb
      Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gradual decay and disuse of the practice of leading noble youths into
      captivity, and compelling them to ascend chimneys, was a severe blow, if
      we may so speak, to the romance of chimney-sweeping, and to the romance of
      spring at the same time. But even this was not all, for some few years ago
      the dancing on May-day began to decline; small sweeps were observed to
      congregate in twos or threes, unsupported by a 'green,' with no 'My Lord'
      to act as master of the ceremonies, and no 'My Lady' to preside over the
      exchequer. Even in companies where there was a 'green' it was an absolute
      nothing-a mere sprout-and the instrumental accompaniments rarely extended
      beyond the shovels and a set of Panpipes, better known to the many, as a
      'mouth-organ.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These were signs of the times, portentous omens of a coming change; and
      what was the result which they shadowed forth? Why, the master sweeps,
      influenced by a restless spirit of innovation, actually interposed their
      authority, in opposition to the dancing, and substituted a dinner-an
      anniversary dinner at White Conduit House-where clean faces appeared in
      lieu of black ones smeared with rose pink; and knee cords and tops
      superseded nankeen drawers and rosetted shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen who were in the habit of riding shy horses; and steady-going
      people who have no vagrancy in their souls, lauded this alteration to the
      skies, and the conduct of the master sweeps was described beyond the reach
      of praise. But how stands the real fact? Let any man deny, if he can, that
      when the cloth had been removed, fresh pots and pipes laid upon the table,
      and the customary loyal and patriotic toasts proposed, the celebrated Mr.
      Sluffen, of Adam-and-Eve-court, whose authority not the most malignant of
      our opponents can call in question, expressed himself in a manner
      following: 'That now he'd cotcht the cheerman's hi, he vished he might be
      jolly vell blessed, if he worn't a goin' to have his innings, vich he
      vould say these here obserwashuns-that how some mischeevus coves as know'd
      nuffin about the consarn, had tried to sit people agin the mas'r swips,
      and take the shine out o' their bis'nes, and the bread out o' the traps o'
      their preshus kids, by a makin' o' this here remark, as chimblies could be
      as vell svept by 'sheenery as by boys; and that the makin' use o' boys for
      that there purpuss vos barbareous; vereas, he 'ad been a chummy-he begged
      the cheerman's parding for usin' such a wulgar hexpression-more nor thirty
      year-he might say he'd been born in a chimbley-and he know'd uncommon vell
      as 'sheenery vos vus nor o' no use: and as to kerhewelty to the boys,
      everybody in the chimbley line know'd as vell as he did, that they liked
      the climbin' better nor nuffin as vos.' From this day, we date the total
      fall of the last lingering remnant of May-day dancing, among the AClite of
      the profession: and from this period we commence a new era in that portion
      of our spring associations which relates to the first of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are aware that the unthinking part of the population will meet us here,
      with the assertion, that dancing on May-day still continues-that 'greens'
      are annually seen to roll along the streets-that youths in the garb of
      clowns, precede them, giving vent to the ebullitions of their sportive
      fancies; and that lords and ladies follow in their wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granted. We are ready to acknowledge that in outward show, these
      processions have greatly improved: we do not deny the introduction of
      solos on the drum; we will even go so far as to admit an occasional
      fantasia on the triangle, but here our admissions end. We positively deny
      that the sweeps have art or part in these proceedings. We distinctly
      charge the dustmen with throwing what they ought to clear away, into the
      eyes of the public. We accuse scavengers, brickmakers, and gentlemen who
      devote their energies to the costermongering line, with obtaining money
      once a-year, under false pretences. We cling with peculiar fondness to the
      custom of days gone by, and have shut out conviction as long as we could,
      but it has forced itself upon us; and we now proclaim to a deluded public,
      that the May-day dancers are not sweeps. The size of them, alone, is
      sufficient to repudiate the idea. It is a notorious fact that the
      widely-spread taste for register-stoves has materially increased the
      demand for small boys; whereas the men, who, under a fictitious character,
      dance about the streets on the first of May nowadays, would be a tight fit
      in a kitchen flue, to say nothing of the parlour. This is strong
      presumptive evidence, but we have positive proof-the evidence of our own
      senses. And here is our testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the morning of the second of the merry month of May, in the year of
      our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six, we went out for a
      stroll, with a kind of forlorn hope of seeing something or other which
      might induce us to believe that it was really spring, and not Christmas.
      After wandering as far as Copenhagen House, without meeting anything
      calculated to dispel our impression that there was a mistake in the
      almanacks, we turned back down Maidenlane, with the intention of passing
      through the extensive colony lying between it and Battle-bridge, which is
      inhabited by proprietors of donkey-carts, boilers of horse-flesh, makers
      of tiles, and sifters of cinders; through which colony we should have
      passed, without stoppage or interruption, if a little crowd gathered round
      a shed had not attracted our attention, and induced us to pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we say a 'shed,' we do not mean the conservatory sort of building,
      which, according to the old song, Love tenanted when he was a young man,
      but a wooden house with windows stuffed with rags and paper, and a small
      yard at the side, with one dust-cart, two baskets, a few shovels, and
      little heaps of cinders, and fragments of china and tiles, scattered about
      it. Before this inviting spot we paused; and the longer we looked, the
      more we wondered what exciting circumstance it could be, that induced the
      foremost members of the crowd to flatten their noses against the parlour
      window, in the vain hope of catching a glimpse of what was going on
      inside. After staring vacantly about us for some minutes, we appealed,
      touching the cause of this assemblage, to a gentleman in a suit of
      tarpaulin, who was smoking his pipe on our right hand; but as the only
      answer we obtained was a playful inquiry whether our mother had disposed
      of her mangle, we determined to await the issue in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge of our virtuous indignation, when the street-door of the shed
      opened, and a party emerged therefrom, clad in the costume and emulating
      the appearance, of May-day sweeps!
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person who appeared was 'my lord,' habited in a blue coat and
      bright buttons, with gilt paper tacked over the seams, yellow knee-
      breeches, pink cotton stockings, and shoes; a cocked hat, ornamented with
      shreds of various-coloured paper, on his head, a bouquet the size of a
      prize cauliflower in his button-hole, a long Belcher handkerchief in his
      right hand, and a thin cane in his left. A murmur of applause ran through
      the crowd (which was chiefly composed of his lordship's personal friends),
      when this graceful figure made his appearance, which swelled into a burst
      of applause as his fair partner in the dance bounded forth to join him.
      Her ladyship was attired in pink crape over bed-furniture, with a low body
      and short sleeves. The symmetry of her ankles was partially concealed by a
      very perceptible pair of frilled trousers; and the inconvenience which
      might have resulted from the circumstance of her white satin shoes being a
      few sizes too large, was obviated by their being firmly attached to her
      legs with strong tape sandals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head was ornamented with a profusion of artificial flowers; and in her
      hand she bore a large brass ladle, wherein to receive what she
      figuratively denominated 'the tin.' The other characters were a young
      gentleman in girl's clothes and a widow's cap; two clowns who walked upon
      their hands in the mud, to the immeasurable delight of all the spectators;
      a man with a drum; another man with a flageolet; a dirty woman in a large
      shawl, with a box under her arm for the money,-and last, though not least,
      the 'green,' animated by no less a personage than our identical friend in
      the tarpaulin suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hammered away at the drum, the flageolet squeaked, the shovels
      rattled, the 'green' rolled about, pitching first on one side and then on
      the other; my lady threw her right foot over her left ankle, and her left
      foot over her right ankle, alternately; my lord ran a few paces forward,
      and butted at the 'green,' and then a few paces backward upon the toes of
      the crowd, and then went to the right, and then to the left, and then
      dodged my lady round the 'green;' and finally drew her arm through his,
      and called upon the boys to shout, which they did lustily-for this was the
      dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed the same group, accidentally, in the evening. We never saw a
      'green' so drunk, a lord so quarrelsome (no: not even in the house of
      peers after dinner), a pair of clowns so melancholy, a lady so muddy, or a
      party so miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      How has May-day decayed!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI-BROKERS' AND MARINE-STORE SHOPS
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we affirm that brokers' shops are strange places, and that if an
      authentic history of their contents could be procured, it would furnish
      many a page of amusement, and many a melancholy tale, it is necessary to
      explain the class of shops to which we allude. Perhaps when we make use of
      the term 'Brokers' Shop,' the minds of our readers will at once picture
      large, handsome warehouses, exhibiting a long perspective of
      French-polished dining-tables, rosewood chiffoniers, and mahogany wash-
      hand-stands, with an occasional vista of a four-post bedstead and
      hangings, and an appropriate foreground of dining-room chairs. Perhaps
      they will imagine that we mean an humble class of second-hand furniture
      repositories. Their imagination will then naturally lead them to that
      street at the back of Long-acre, which is composed almost entirely of
      brokers' shops; where you walk through groves of deceitful, showy- looking
      furniture, and where the prospect is occasionally enlivened by a bright
      red, blue, and yellow hearth-rug, embellished with the pleasing device of
      a mail-coach at full speed, or a strange animal, supposed to have been
      originally intended for a dog, with a mass of worsted-work in his mouth,
      which conjecture has likened to a basket of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, by-the-bye, is a tempting article to young wives in the humbler
      ranks of life, who have a first-floor front to furnish-they are lost in
      admiration, and hardly know which to admire most. The dog is very
      beautiful, but they have a dog already on the best tea-tray, and two more
      on the mantel-piece. Then, there is something so genteel about that
      mail-coach; and the passengers outside (who are all hat) give it such an
      air of reality!
    </p>
    <p>
      The goods here are adapted to the taste, or rather to the means, of cheap
      purchasers. There are some of the most beautiful looking Pembroke tables
      that were ever beheld: the wood as green as the trees in the Park, and the
      leaves almost as certain to fall off in the course of a year. There is
      also a most extensive assortment of tent and turn-up bedsteads, made of
      stained wood, and innumerable specimens of that base imposition on
      society-a sofa bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A turn-up bedstead is a blunt, honest piece of furniture; it may be
      slightly disguised with a sham drawer; and sometimes a mad attempt is even
      made to pass it off for a book-case; ornament it as you will, however, the
      turn-up bedstead seems to defy disguise, and to insist on having it
      distinctly understood that he is a turn-up bedstead, and nothing else-that
      he is indispensably necessary, and that being so useful, he disdains to be
      ornamental.
    </p>
    <p>
      How different is the demeanour of a sofa bedstead! Ashamed of its real
      use, it strives to appear an article of luxury and gentility-an attempt in
      which it miserably fails. It has neither the respectability of a sofa, nor
      the virtues of a bed; every man who keeps a sofa bedstead in his house,
      becomes a party to a wilful and designing fraud-we question whether you
      could insult him more, than by insinuating that you entertain the least
      suspicion of its real use.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return from this digression, we beg to say, that neither of these
      classes of brokers' shops, forms the subject of this sketch. The shops to
      which we advert, are immeasurably inferior to those on whose outward
      appearance we have slightly touched. Our readers must often have observed
      in some by-street, in a poor neighbourhood, a small dirty shop, exposing
      for sale the most extraordinary and confused jumble of old, worn-out,
      wretched articles, that can well be imagined. Our wonder at their ever
      having been bought, is only to be equalled by our astonishment at the idea
      of their ever being sold again. On a board, at the side of the door, are
      placed about twenty books-all odd volumes; and as many wine-glasses-all
      different patterns; several locks, an old earthenware pan, full of rusty
      keys; two or three gaudy chimney- ornaments-cracked, of course; the
      remains of a lustre, without any drops; a round frame like a capital O,
      which has once held a mirror; a flute, complete with the exception of the
      middle joint; a pair of curling-irons; and a tinder-box. In front of the
      shop-window, are ranged some half-dozen high-backed chairs, with spinal
      complaints and wasted legs; a corner cupboard; two or three very dark
      mahogany tables with flaps like mathematical problems; some pickle-jars,
      some surgeons' ditto, with gilt labels and without stoppers; an unframed
      portrait of some lady who flourished about the beginning of the thirteenth
      century, by an artist who never flourished at all; an incalculable host of
      miscellanies of every description, including bottles and cabinets, rags
      and bones, fenders and street-door knockers, fire-irons, wearing apparel
      and bedding, a hall-lamp, and a room-door. Imagine, in addition to this
      incongruous mass, a black doll in a white frock, with two faces-one
      looking up the street, and the other looking down, swinging over the door;
      a board with the squeezed-up inscription 'Dealer in marine stores,' in
      lanky white letters, whose height is strangely out of proportion to their
      width; and you have before you precisely the kind of shop to which we wish
      to direct your attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the same heterogeneous mixture of things will be found at all
      these places, it is curious to observe how truly and accurately some of
      the minor articles which are exposed for sale-articles of wearing apparel,
      for instance-mark the character of the neighbourhood. Take Drury-Lane and
      Covent-garden for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is essentially a theatrical neighbourhood. There is not a potboy in
      the vicinity who is not, to a greater or less extent, a dramatic
      character. The errand-boys and chandler's-shop-keepers' sons, are all
      stage-struck: they 'gets up' plays in back kitchens hired for the purpose,
      and will stand before a shop-window for hours, contemplating a great
      staring portrait of Mr. Somebody or other, of the Royal Coburg Theatre,
      'as he appeared in the character of Tongo the Denounced.' The consequence
      is, that there is not a marine-store shop in the neighbourhood, which does
      not exhibit for sale some faded articles of dramatic finery, such as three
      or four pairs of soiled buff boots with turn-over red tops, heretofore
      worn by a 'fourth robber,' or 'fifth mob;' a pair of rusty broadswords, a
      few gauntlets, and certain resplendent ornaments, which, if they were
      yellow instead of white, might be taken for insurance plates of the Sun
      Fire-office. There are several of these shops in the narrow streets and
      dirty courts, of which there are so many near the national theatres, and
      they all have tempting goods of this description, with the addition,
      perhaps, of a lady's pink dress covered with spangles; white wreaths,
      stage shoes, and a tiara like a tin lamp reflector. They have been
      purchased of some wretched supernumeraries, or sixth-rate actors, and are
      now offered for the benefit of the rising generation, who, on condition of
      making certain weekly payments, amounting in the whole to about ten times
      their value, may avail themselves of such desirable bargains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take a very different quarter, and apply it to the same test. Look
      at a marine-store dealer's, in that reservoir of dirt, drunkenness, and
      drabs: thieves, oysters, baked potatoes, and pickled
      salmon-Ratcliff-highway. Here, the wearing apparel is all nautical. Rough
      blue jackets, with mother-of-pearl buttons, oil-skin hats, coarse checked
      shirts, and large canvas trousers that look as if they were made for a
      pair of bodies instead of a pair of legs, are the staple commodities.
      Then, there are large bunches of cotton pocket- handkerchiefs, in colour
      and pattern unlike any one ever saw before, with the exception of those on
      the backs of the three young ladies without bonnets who passed just now.
      The furniture is much the same as elsewhere, with the addition of one or
      two models of ships, and some old prints of naval engagements in still
      older frames. In the window, are a few compasses, a small tray containing
      silver watches in clumsy thick cases; and tobacco-boxes, the lid of each
      ornamented with a ship, or an anchor, or some such trophy. A sailor
      generally pawns or sells all he has before he has been long ashore, and if
      he does not, some favoured companion kindly saves him the trouble. In
      either case, it is an even chance that he afterwards unconsciously
      repurchases the same things at a higher price than he gave for them at
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: pay a visit with a similar object, to a part of London, as unlike
      both of these as they are to each other. Cross over to the Surrey side,
      and look at such shops of this description as are to be found near the
      King's Bench prison, and in 'the Rules.' How different, and how strikingly
      illustrative of the decay of some of the unfortunate residents in this
      part of the metropolis! Imprisonment and neglect have done their work.
      There is contamination in the profligate denizens of a debtor's prison;
      old friends have fallen off; the recollection of former prosperity has
      passed away; and with it all thoughts for the past, all care for the
      future. First, watches and rings, then cloaks, coats, and all the more
      expensive articles of dress, have found their way to the pawnbroker's.
      That miserable resource has failed at last, and the sale of some trifling
      article at one of these shops, has been the only mode left of raising a
      shilling or two, to meet the urgent demands of the moment. Dressing-cases
      and writing-desks, too old to pawn but too good to keep; guns,
      fishing-rods, musical instruments, all in the same condition; have first
      been sold, and the sacrifice has been but slightly felt. But hunger must
      be allayed, and what has already become a habit, is easily resorted to,
      when an emergency arises. Light articles of clothing, first of the ruined
      man, then of his wife, at last of their children, even of the youngest,
      have been parted with, piecemeal. There they are, thrown carelessly
      together until a purchaser presents himself, old, and patched and
      repaired, it is true; but the make and materials tell of better days; and
      the older they are, the greater the misery and destitution of those whom
      they once adorned.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII-GIN-SHOPS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is a remarkable circumstance, that different trades appear to partake
      of the disease to which elephants and dogs are especially liable, and to
      run stark, staring, raving mad, periodically. The great distinction
      between the animals and the trades, is, that the former run mad with a
      certain degree of propriety-they are very regular in their irregularities.
      We know the period at which the emergency will arise, and provide against
      it accordingly. If an elephant run mad, we are all ready for him-kill or
      cure-pills or bullets, calomel in conserve of roses, or lead in a
      musket-barrel. If a dog happen to look unpleasantly warm in the summer
      months, and to trot about the shady side of the streets with a quarter of
      a yard of tongue hanging out of his mouth, a thick leather muzzle, which
      has been previously prepared in compliance with the thoughtful injunctions
      of the Legislature, is instantly clapped over his head, by way of making
      him cooler, and he either looks remarkably unhappy for the next six weeks,
      or becomes legally insane, and goes mad, as it were, by Act of Parliament.
      But these trades are as eccentric as comets; nay, worse, for no one can
      calculate on the recurrence of the strange appearances which betoken the
      disease. Moreover, the contagion is general, and the quickness with which
      it diffuses itself, almost incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will cite two or three cases in illustration of our meaning. Six or
      eight years ago, the epidemic began to display itself among the linen-
      drapers and haberdashers. The primary symptoms were an inordinate love of
      plate-glass, and a passion for gas-lights and gilding. The disease
      gradually progressed, and at last attained a fearful height. Quiet, dusty
      old shops in different parts of town, were pulled down; spacious premises
      with stuccoed fronts and gold letters, were erected instead; floors were
      covered with Turkey carpets; roofs supported by massive pillars; doors
      knocked into windows; a dozen squares of glass into one; one shopman into
      a dozen; and there is no knowing what would have been done, if it had not
      been fortunately discovered, just in time, that the Commissioners of
      Bankruptcy were as competent to decide such cases as the Commissioners of
      Lunacy, and that a little confinement and gentle examination did wonders.
      The disease abated. It died away. A year or two of comparative
      tranquillity ensued. Suddenly it burst out again amongst the chemists; the
      symptoms were the same, with the addition of a strong desire to stick the
      royal arms over the shop-door, and a great rage for mahogany, varnish, and
      expensive floor-cloth. Then, the hosiers were infected, and began to pull
      down their shop-fronts with frantic recklessness. The mania again died
      away, and the public began to congratulate themselves on its entire
      disappearance, when it burst forth with tenfold violence among the
      publicans, and keepers of 'wine vaults.' From that moment it has spread
      among them with unprecedented rapidity, exhibiting a concatenation of all
      the previous symptoms; onward it has rushed to every part of town,
      knocking down all the old public-houses, and depositing splendid mansions,
      stone balustrades, rosewood fittings, immense lamps, and illuminated
      clocks, at the corner of every street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extensive scale on which these places are established, and the
      ostentatious manner in which the business of even the smallest among them
      is divided into branches, is amusing. A handsome plate of ground glass in
      one door directs you 'To the Counting-house;' another to the 'Bottle
      Department; a third to the 'Wholesale Department;' a fourth to 'The Wine
      Promenade;' and so forth, until we are in daily expectation of meeting
      with a 'Brandy Bell,' or a 'Whiskey Entrance.' Then, ingenuity is
      exhausted in devising attractive titles for the different descriptions of
      gin; and the dram-drinking portion of the community as they gaze upon the
      gigantic black and white announcements, which are only to be equalled in
      size by the figures beneath them, are left in a state of pleasing
      hesitation between 'The Cream of the Valley,' 'The Out and Out,' 'The No
      Mistake,' 'The Good for Mixing,' 'The real Knock-me- down,' 'The
      celebrated Butter Gin,' 'The regular Flare-up,' and a dozen other, equally
      inviting and wholesome liqueurs. Although places of this description are
      to be met with in every second street, they are invariably numerous and
      splendid in precise proportion to the dirt and poverty of the surrounding
      neighbourhood. The gin-shops in and near Drury-Lane, Holborn, St. Giles's,
      Covent-garden, and Clare-market, are the handsomest in London. There is
      more of filth and squalid misery near those great thorough-fares than in
      any part of this mighty city.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will endeavour to sketch the bar of a large gin-shop, and its ordinary
      customers, for the edification of such of our readers as may not have had
      opportunities of observing such scenes; and on the chance of finding one
      well suited to our purpose, we will make for Drury-Lane, through the
      narrow streets and dirty courts which divide it from Oxford- street, and
      that classical spot adjoining the brewery at the bottom of
      Tottenham-court-road, best known to the initiated as the 'Rookery.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The filthy and miserable appearance of this part of London can hardly be
      imagined by those (and there are many such) who have not witnessed it.
      Wretched houses with broken windows patched with rags and paper: every
      room let out to a different family, and in many instances to two or even
      three-fruit and 'sweet-stuff' manufacturers in the cellars, barbers and
      red-herring vendors in the front parlours, cobblers in the back; a bird-
      fancier in the first floor, three families on the second, starvation in
      the attics, Irishmen in the passage, a 'musician' in the front kitchen,
      and a charwoman and five hungry children in the back one-filth
      everywhere-a gutter before the houses and a drain behind-clothes drying
      and slops emptying, from the windows; girls of fourteen or fifteen, with
      matted hair, walking about barefoot, and in white great-coats, almost
      their only covering; boys of all ages, in coats of all sizes and no coats
      at all; men and women, in every variety of scanty and dirty apparel,
      lounging, scolding, drinking, smoking, squabbling, fighting, and swearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You turn the corner. What a change! All is light and brilliancy. The hum
      of many voices issues from that splendid gin-shop which forms the
      commencement of the two streets opposite; and the gay building with the
      fantastically ornamented parapet, the illuminated clock, the plate-glass
      windows surrounded by stucco rosettes, and its profusion of gas-lights in
      richly-gilt burners, is perfectly dazzling when contrasted with the
      darkness and dirt we have just left. The interior is even gayer than the
      exterior. A bar of French-polished mahogany, elegantly carved, extends the
      whole width of the place; and there are two side-aisles of great casks,
      painted green and gold, enclosed within a light brass rail, and bearing
      such inscriptions, as 'Old Tom, 549;' 'Young Tom, 360;' 'Samson, 1421'-the
      figures agreeing, we presume, with 'gallons,' understood. Beyond the bar
      is a lofty and spacious saloon, full of the same enticing vessels, with a
      gallery running round it, equally well furnished. On the counter, in
      addition to the usual spirit apparatus, are two or three little baskets of
      cakes and biscuits, which are carefully secured at top with wicker-work,
      to prevent their contents being unlawfully abstracted. Behind it, are two
      showily-dressed damsels with large necklaces, dispensing the spirits and
      'compounds.' They are assisted by the ostensible proprietor of the
      concern, a stout, coarse fellow in a fur cap, put on very much on one side
      to give him a knowing air, and to display his sandy whiskers to the best
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two old washerwomen, who are seated on the little bench to the left of
      the bar, are rather overcome by the head-dresses and haughty demeanour of
      the young ladies who officiate. They receive their half- quartern of gin
      and peppermint, with considerable deference, prefacing a request for 'one
      of them soft biscuits,' with a 'Jist be good enough, ma'am.' They are
      quite astonished at the impudent air of the young fellow in a brown coat
      and bright buttons, who, ushering in his two companions, and walking up to
      the bar in as careless a manner as if he had been used to green and gold
      ornaments all his life, winks at one of the young ladies with singular
      coolness, and calls for a 'kervorten and a three-out-glass,' just as if
      the place were his own. 'Gin for you, sir?' says the young lady when she
      has drawn it: carefully looking every way but the right one, to show that
      the wink had no effect upon her. 'For me, Mary, my dear,' replies the
      gentleman in brown. 'My name an't Mary as it happens,' says the young
      girl, rather relaxing as she delivers the change. 'Well, if it an't, it
      ought to be,' responds the irresistible one; 'all the Marys as ever I see,
      was handsome gals.' Here the young lady, not precisely remembering how
      blushes are managed in such cases, abruptly ends the flirtation by
      addressing the female in the faded feathers who has just entered, and who,
      after stating explicitly, to prevent any subsequent misunderstanding, that
      'this gentleman pays,' calls for 'a glass of port wine and a bit of
      sugar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Those two old men who came in 'just to have a drain,' finished their third
      quartern a few seconds ago; they have made themselves crying drunk; and
      the fat comfortable-looking elderly women, who had 'a glass of rum-srub'
      each, having chimed in with their complaints on the hardness of the times,
      one of the women has agreed to stand a glass round, jocularly observing
      that 'grief never mended no broken bones, and as good people's wery
      scarce, what I says is, make the most on 'em, and that's all about it!' a
      sentiment which appears to afford unlimited satisfaction to those who have
      nothing to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is growing late, and the throng of men, women, and children, who have
      been constantly going in and out, dwindles down to two or three occasional
      stragglers-cold, wretched-looking creatures, in the last stage of
      emaciation and disease. The knot of Irish labourers at the lower end of
      the place, who have been alternately shaking hands with, and threatening
      the life of each other, for the last hour, become furious in their
      disputes, and finding it impossible to silence one man, who is
      particularly anxious to adjust the difference, they resort to the
      expedient of knocking him down and jumping on him afterwards. The man in
      the fur cap, and the potboy rush out; a scene of riot and confusion
      ensues; half the Irishmen get shut out, and the other half get shut in;
      the potboy is knocked among the tubs in no time; the landlord hits
      everybody, and everybody hits the landlord; the barmaids scream; the
      police come in; the rest is a confused mixture of arms, legs, staves, torn
      coats, shouting, and struggling. Some of the party are borne off to the
      station-house, and the remainder slink home to beat their wives for
      complaining, and kick the children for daring to be hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have sketched this subject very slightly, not only because our limits
      compel us to do so, but because, if it were pursued farther, it would be
      painful and repulsive. Well-disposed gentlemen, and charitable ladies,
      would alike turn with coldness and disgust from a description of the
      drunken besotted men, and wretched broken-down miserable women, who form
      no inconsiderable portion of the frequenters of these haunts; forgetting,
      in the pleasant consciousness of their own rectitude, the poverty of the
      one, and the temptation of the other. Gin-drinking is a great vice in
      England, but wretchedness and dirt are a greater; and until you improve
      the homes of the poor, or persuade a half-famished wretch not to seek
      relief in the temporary oblivion of his own misery, with the pittance
      which, divided among his family, would furnish a morsel of bread for each,
      gin-shops will increase in number and splendour. If Temperance Societies
      would suggest an antidote against hunger, filth, and foul air, or could
      establish dispensaries for the gratuitous distribution of bottles of
      Lethe-water, gin-palaces would be numbered among the things that were.

      CHAPTER XXIII-THE PAWNBROKER'S SHOP
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of the numerous receptacles for misery and distress with which the streets
      of London unhappily abound, there are, perhaps, none which present such
      striking scenes as the pawnbrokers' shops. The very nature and description
      of these places occasions their being but little known, except to the
      unfortunate beings whose profligacy or misfortune drives them to seek the
      temporary relief they offer. The subject may appear, at first sight, to be
      anything but an inviting one, but we venture on it nevertheless, in the
      hope that, as far as the limits of our present paper are concerned, it
      will present nothing to disgust even the most fastidious reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some pawnbrokers' shops of a very superior description. There
      are grades in pawning as in everything else, and distinctions must be
      observed even in poverty. The aristocratic Spanish cloak and the plebeian
      calico shirt, the silver fork and the flat iron, the muslin cravat and the
      Belcher neckerchief, would but ill assort together; so, the better sort of
      pawnbroker calls himself a silver-smith, and decorates his shop with
      handsome trinkets and expensive jewellery, while the more humble
      money-lender boldly advertises his calling, and invites observation. It is
      with pawnbrokers' shops of the latter class, that we have to do. We have
      selected one for our purpose, and will endeavour to describe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pawnbroker's shop is situated near Drury-Lane, at the corner of a
      court, which affords a side entrance for the accommodation of such
      customers as may be desirous of avoiding the observation of the passers-
      by, or the chance of recognition in the public street. It is a low,
      dirty-looking, dusty shop, the door of which stands always doubtfully, a
      little way open: half inviting, half repelling the hesitating visitor,
      who, if he be as yet uninitiated, examines one of the old garnet brooches
      in the window for a minute or two with affected eagerness, as if he
      contemplated making a purchase; and then looking cautiously round to
      ascertain that no one watches him, hastily slinks in: the door closing of
      itself after him, to just its former width. The shop front and the
      window-frames bear evident marks of having been once painted; but, what
      the colour was originally, or at what date it was probably laid on, are at
      this remote period questions which may be asked, but cannot be answered.
      Tradition states that the transparency in the front door, which displays
      at night three red balls on a blue ground, once bore also, inscribed in
      graceful waves, the words 'Money advanced on plate, jewels, wearing
      apparel, and every description of property,' but a few illegible
      hieroglyphics are all that now remain to attest the fact. The plate and
      jewels would seem to have disappeared, together with the announcement, for
      the articles of stock, which are displayed in some profusion in the
      window, do not include any very valuable luxuries of either kind. A few
      old china cups; some modern vases, adorned with paltry paintings of three
      Spanish cavaliers playing three Spanish guitars; or a party of boors
      carousing: each boor with one leg painfully elevated in the air, by way of
      expressing his perfect freedom and gaiety; several sets of chessmen, two
      or three flutes, a few fiddles, a round-eyed portrait staring in
      astonishment from a very dark ground; some gaudily-bound prayer-books and
      testaments, two rows of silver watches quite as clumsy and almost as large
      as Ferguson's first; numerous old-fashioned table and tea spoons,
      displayed, fan-like, in half-dozens; strings of coral with great broad
      gilt snaps; cards of rings and brooches, fastened and labelled separately,
      like the insects in the British Museum; cheap silver penholders and
      snuff-boxes, with a masonic star, complete the jewellery department; while
      five or six beds in smeary clouded ticks, strings of blankets and sheets,
      silk and cotton handkerchiefs, and wearing apparel of every description,
      form the more useful, though even less ornamental, part, of the articles
      exposed for sale. An extensive collection of planes, chisels, saws, and
      other carpenters' tools, which have been pledged, and never redeemed, form
      the foreground of the picture; while the large frames full of ticketed
      bundles, which are dimly seen through the dirty casement up-stairs-the
      squalid neighbourhood-the adjoining houses, straggling, shrunken, and
      rotten, with one or two filthy, unwholesome-looking heads thrust out of
      every window, and old red pans and stunted plants exposed on the tottering
      parapets, to the manifest hazard of the heads of the passers- by-the noisy
      men loitering under the archway at the corner of the court, or about the
      gin-shop next door-and their wives patiently standing on the curb-stone,
      with large baskets of cheap vegetables slung round them for sale, are its
      immediate auxiliaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the outside of the pawnbroker's shop be calculated to attract the
      attention, or excite the interest, of the speculative pedestrian, its
      interior cannot fail to produce the same effect in an increased degree.
      The front door, which we have before noticed, opens into the common shop,
      which is the resort of all those customers whose habitual acquaintance
      with such scenes renders them indifferent to the observation of their
      companions in poverty. The side door opens into a small passage from which
      some half-dozen doors (which may be secured on the inside by bolts) open
      into a corresponding number of little dens, or closets, which face the
      counter. Here, the more timid or respectable portion of the crowd shroud
      themselves from the notice of the remainder, and patiently wait until the
      gentleman behind the counter, with the curly black hair, diamond ring, and
      double silver watch-guard, shall feel disposed to favour them with his
      notice-a consummation which depends considerably on the temper of the
      aforesaid gentleman for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the present moment, this elegantly-attired individual is in the act of
      entering the duplicate he has just made out, in a thick book: a process
      from which he is diverted occasionally, by a conversation he is carrying
      on with another young man similarly employed at a little distance from
      him, whose allusions to 'that last bottle of soda-water last night,' and
      'how regularly round my hat he felt himself when the young 'ooman gave 'em
      in charge,' would appear to refer to the consequences of some stolen
      joviality of the preceding evening. The customers generally, however, seem
      unable to participate in the amusement derivable from this source, for an
      old sallow-looking woman, who has been leaning with both arms on the
      counter with a small bundle before her, for half an hour previously,
      suddenly interrupts the conversation by addressing the jewelled
      shopman-'Now, Mr. Henry, do make haste, there's a good soul, for my two
      grandchildren's locked up at home, and I'm afeer'd of the fire.' The
      shopman slightly raises his head, with an air of deep abstraction, and
      resumes his entry with as much deliberation as if he were engraving.
      'You're in a hurry, Mrs. Tatham, this ev'nin', an't you?' is the only
      notice he deigns to take, after the lapse of five minutes or so. 'Yes, I
      am indeed, Mr. Henry; now, do serve me next, there's a good creetur. I
      wouldn't worry you, only it's all along o' them botherin' children.' 'What
      have you got here?' inquires the shopman, unpinning the bundle-'old
      concern, I suppose-pair o' stays and a petticut. You must look up
      somethin' else, old 'ooman; I can't lend you anything more upon them;
      they're completely worn out by this time, if it's only by putting in, and
      taking out again, three times a week.' 'Oh! you're a rum un, you are,'
      replies the old woman, laughing extremely, as in duty bound; 'I wish I'd
      got the gift of the gab like you; see if I'd be up the spout so often
      then! No, no; it an't the petticut; it's a child's frock and a beautiful
      silk ankecher, as belongs to my husband. He gave four shillin' for it, the
      werry same blessed day as he broke his arm.'-'What do you want upon
      these?' inquires Mr. Henry, slightly glancing at the articles, which in
      all probability are old acquaintances. 'What do you want upon
      these?'-'Eighteenpence.'-'Lend you ninepence.'-'Oh, make it a shillin';
      there's a dear-do now?'-'Not another farden.'-'Well, I suppose I must take
      it.' The duplicate is made out, one ticket pinned on the parcel, the other
      given to the old woman; the parcel is flung carelessly down into a corner,
      and some other customer prefers his claim to be served without further
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice falls on an unshaven, dirty, sottish-looking fellow, whose
      tarnished paper-cap, stuck negligently over one eye, communicates an
      additionally repulsive expression to his very uninviting countenance. He
      was enjoying a little relaxation from his sedentary pursuits a quarter of
      an hour ago, in kicking his wife up the court. He has come to redeem some
      tools:-probably to complete a job with, on account of which he has already
      received some money, if his inflamed countenance and drunken staggers may
      be taken as evidence of the fact. Having waited some little time, he makes
      his presence known by venting his ill- humour on a ragged urchin, who,
      being unable to bring his face on a level with the counter by any other
      process, has employed himself in climbing up, and then hooking himself on
      with his elbows-an uneasy perch, from which he has fallen at intervals,
      generally alighting on the toes of the person in his immediate vicinity.
      In the present case, the unfortunate little wretch has received a cuff
      which sends him reeling to this door; and the donor of the blow is
      immediately the object of general indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you strike the boy for, you brute?' exclaims a slipshod woman,
      with two flat irons in a little basket. 'Do you think he's your wife, you
      willin?' 'Go and hang yourself!' replies the gentleman addressed, with a
      drunken look of savage stupidity, aiming at the same time a blow at the
      woman which fortunately misses its object. 'Go and hang yourself; and wait
      till I come and cut you down.'-'Cut you down,' rejoins the woman, 'I wish
      I had the cutting of you up, you wagabond! (loud.) Oh! you precious
      wagabond! (rather louder.) Where's your wife, you willin? (louder still;
      women of this class are always sympathetic, and work themselves into a
      tremendous passion on the shortest notice.) Your poor dear wife as you
      uses worser nor a dog-strike a woman-you a man! (very shrill;) I wish I
      had you-I'd murder you, I would, if I died for it!'-'Now be civil,'
      retorts the man fiercely. 'Be civil, you wiper!' ejaculates the woman
      contemptuously. 'An't it shocking?' she continues, turning round, and
      appealing to an old woman who is peeping out of one of the little closets
      we have before described, and who has not the slightest objection to join
      in the attack, possessing, as she does, the comfortable conviction that
      she is bolted in. 'Ain't it shocking, ma'am? (Dreadful! says the old woman
      in a parenthesis, not exactly knowing what the question refers to.) He's
      got a wife, ma'am, as takes in mangling, and is as 'dustrious and
      hard-working a young 'ooman as can be, (very fast) as lives in the back
      parlour of our 'ous, which my husband and me lives in the front one (with
      great rapidity)-and we hears him a beaten' on her sometimes when he comes
      home drunk, the whole night through, and not only a beaten' her, but
      beaten' his own child too, to make her more miserable-ugh, you beast! and
      she, poor creater, won't swear the peace agin him, nor do nothin', because
      she likes the wretch arter all-worse luck!' Here, as the woman has
      completely run herself out of breath, the pawnbroker himself, who has just
      appeared behind the counter in a gray dressing-gown, embraces the
      favourable opportunity of putting in a word:-'Now I won't have none of
      this sort of thing on my premises!' he interposes with an air of
      authority. 'Mrs. Mackin, keep yourself to yourself, or you don't get
      fourpence for a flat iron here; and Jinkins, you leave your ticket here
      till you're sober, and send your wife for them two planes, for I won't
      have you in my shop at no price; so make yourself scarce, before I make
      you scarcer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This eloquent address produces anything but the effect desired; the women
      rail in concert; the man hits about him in all directions, and is in the
      act of establishing an indisputable claim to gratuitous lodgings for the
      night, when the entrance of his wife, a wretched, worn-out woman,
      apparently in the last stage of consumption, whose face bears evident
      marks of recent ill-usage, and whose strength seems hardly equal to the
      burden-light enough, God knows!-of the thin, sickly child she carries in
      her arms, turns his cowardly rage in a safer direction. 'Come home, dear,'
      cries the miserable creature, in an imploring tone; 'do come home, there's
      a good fellow, and go to bed.'-'Go home yourself,' rejoins the furious
      ruffian. 'Do come home quietly,' repeats the wife, bursting into tears.
      'Go home yourself,' retorts the husband again, enforcing his argument by a
      blow which sends the poor creature flying out of the shop. Her 'natural
      protector' follows her up the court, alternately venting his rage in
      accelerating her progress, and in knocking the little scanty blue bonnet
      of the unfortunate child over its still more scanty and faded-looking
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last box, which is situated in the darkest and most obscure corner
      of the shop, considerably removed from either of the gas-lights, are a
      young delicate girl of about twenty, and an elderly female, evidently her
      mother from the resemblance between them, who stand at some distance back,
      as if to avoid the observation even of the shopman. It is not their first
      visit to a pawnbroker's shop, for they answer without a moment's
      hesitation the usual questions, put in a rather respectful manner, and in
      a much lower tone than usual, of 'What name shall I say?-Your own
      property, of course?-Where do you live?-Housekeeper or lodger?' They
      bargain, too, for a higher loan than the shopman is at first inclined to
      offer, which a perfect stranger would be little disposed to do; and the
      elder female urges her daughter on, in scarcely audible whispers, to exert
      her utmost powers of persuasion to obtain an advance of the sum, and
      expatiate on the value of the articles they have brought to raise a
      present supply upon. They are a small gold chain and a 'Forget me not'
      ring: the girl's property, for they are both too small for the mother;
      given her in better times; prized, perhaps, once, for the giver's sake,
      but parted with now without a struggle; for want has hardened the mother,
      and her example has hardened the girl, and the prospect of receiving
      money, coupled with a recollection of the misery they have both endured
      from the want of it-the coldness of old friends-the stern refusal of some,
      and the still more galling compassion of others-appears to have
      obliterated the consciousness of self-humiliation, which the idea of their
      present situation would once have aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next box, is a young female, whose attire, miserably poor, but
      extremely gaudy, wretchedly cold, but extravagantly fine, too plainly
      bespeaks her station. The rich satin gown with its faded trimmings, the
      worn-out thin shoes, and pink silk stockings, the summer bonnet in winter,
      and the sunken face, where a daub of rouge only serves as an index to the
      ravages of squandered health never to be regained, and lost happiness
      never to be restored, and where the practised smile is a wretched mockery
      of the misery of the heart, cannot be mistaken. There is something in the
      glimpse she has just caught of her young neighbour, and in the sight of
      the little trinkets she has offered in pawn, that seems to have awakened
      in this woman's mind some slumbering recollection, and to have changed,
      for an instant, her whole demeanour. Her first hasty impulse was to bend
      forward as if to scan more minutely the appearance of her half-concealed
      companions; her next, on seeing them involuntarily shrink from her, to
      retreat to the back of the box, cover her face with her hands, and burst
      into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are strange chords in the human heart, which will lie dormant
      through years of depravity and wickedness, but which will vibrate at last
      to some slight circumstance apparently trivial in itself, but connected by
      some undefined and indistinct association, with past days that can never
      be recalled, and with bitter recollections from which the most degraded
      creature in existence cannot escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been another spectator, in the person of a woman in the common
      shop; the lowest of the low; dirty, unbonneted, flaunting, and slovenly.
      Her curiosity was at first attracted by the little she could see of the
      group; then her attention. The half-intoxicated leer changed to an
      expression of something like interest, and a feeling similar to that we
      have described, appeared for a moment, and only a moment, to extend itself
      even to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who shall say how soon these women may change places? The last has but two
      more stages-the hospital and the grave. How many females situated as her
      two companions are, and as she may have been once, have terminated the
      same wretched course, in the same wretched manner! One is already tracing
      her footsteps with frightful rapidity. How soon may the other follow her
      example! How many have done the same!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV-CRIMINAL COURTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      We shall never forget the mingled feelings of awe and respect with which
      we used to gaze on the exterior of Newgate in our schoolboy days. How
      dreadful its rough heavy walls, and low massive doors, appeared to us-the
      latter looking as if they were made for the express purpose of letting
      people in, and never letting them out again. Then the fetters over the
      debtors' door, which we used to think were a bonAc fide set of irons, just
      hung up there, for convenience' sake, ready to be taken down at a moment's
      notice, and riveted on the limbs of some refractory felon! We were never
      tired of wondering how the hackney-coachmen on the opposite stand could
      cut jokes in the presence of such horrors, and drink pots of half-and-half
      so near the last drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often have we strayed here, in sessions time, to catch a glimpse of the
      whipping-place, and that dark building on one side of the yard, in which
      is kept the gibbet with all its dreadful apparatus, and on the door of
      which we half expected to see a brass plate, with the inscription 'Mr.
      Ketch;' for we never imagined that the distinguished functionary could by
      possibility live anywhere else! The days of these childish dreams have
      passed away, and with them many other boyish ideas of a gayer nature. But
      we still retain so much of our original feeling, that to this hour we
      never pass the building without something like a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      What London pedestrian is there who has not, at some time or other, cast a
      hurried glance through the wicket at which prisoners are admitted into
      this gloomy mansion, and surveyed the few objects he could discern, with
      an indescribable feeling of curiosity? The thick door, plated with iron
      and mounted with spikes, just low enough to enable you to see, leaning
      over them, an ill-looking fellow, in a broad-brimmed hat, Belcher
      handkerchief and top-boots: with a brown coat, something between a
      great-coat and a 'sporting' jacket, on his back, and an immense key in his
      left hand. Perhaps you are lucky enough to pass, just as the gate is being
      opened; then, you see on the other side of the lodge, another gate, the
      image of its predecessor, and two or three more turnkeys, who look like
      multiplications of the first one, seated round a fire which just lights up
      the whitewashed apartment sufficiently to enable you to catch a hasty
      glimpse of these different objects. We have a great respect for Mrs. Fry,
      but she certainly ought to have written more romances than Mrs. Radcliffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were walking leisurely down the Old Bailey, some time ago, when, as we
      passed this identical gate, it was opened by the officiating turnkey. We
      turned quickly round, as a matter of course, and saw two persons
      descending the steps. We could not help stopping and observing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were an elderly woman, of decent appearance, though evidently poor,
      and a boy of about fourteen or fifteen. The woman was crying bitterly; she
      carried a small bundle in her hand, and the boy followed at a short
      distance behind her. Their little history was obvious. The boy was her
      son, to whose early comfort she had perhaps sacrificed her own-for whose
      sake she had borne misery without repining, and poverty without a
      murmur-looking steadily forward to the time, when he who had so long
      witnessed her struggles for himself, might be enabled to make some
      exertions for their joint support. He had formed dissolute connexions;
      idleness had led to crime; and he had been committed to take his trial for
      some petty theft. He had been long in prison, and, after receiving some
      trifling additional punishment, had been ordered to be discharged that
      morning. It was his first offence, and his poor old mother, still hoping
      to reclaim him, had been waiting at the gate to implore him to return
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot forget the boy; he descended the steps with a dogged look,
      shaking his head with an air of bravado and obstinate determination. They
      walked a few paces, and paused. The woman put her hand upon his shoulder
      in an agony of entreaty, and the boy sullenly raised his head as if in
      refusal. It was a brilliant morning, and every object looked fresh and
      happy in the broad, gay sunlight; he gazed round him for a few moments,
      bewildered with the brightness of the scene, for it was long since he had
      beheld anything save the gloomy walls of a prison. Perhaps the
      wretchedness of his mother made some impression on the boy's heart;
      perhaps some undefined recollection of the time when he was a happy child,
      and she his only friend, and best companion, crowded on him-he burst into
      tears; and covering his face with one hand, and hurriedly placing the
      other in his mother's, walked away with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity has occasionally led us into both Courts at the Old Bailey.
      Nothing is so likely to strike the person who enters them for the first
      time, as the calm indifference with which the proceedings are conducted;
      every trial seems a mere matter of business. There is a great deal of
      form, but no compassion; considerable interest, but no sympathy. Take the
      Old Court for example. There sit the judges, with whose great dignity
      everybody is acquainted, and of whom therefore we need say no more. Then,
      there is the Lord Mayor in the centre, looking as cool as a Lord Mayor can
      look, with an immense bouquet before him, and habited in all the splendour
      of his office. Then, there are the Sheriffs, who are almost as dignified
      as the Lord Mayor himself; and the Barristers, who are quite dignified
      enough in their own opinion; and the spectators, who having paid for their
      admission, look upon the whole scene as if it were got up especially for
      their amusement. Look upon the whole group in the body of the Court-some
      wholly engrossed in the morning papers, others carelessly conversing in
      low whispers, and others, again, quietly dozing away an hour-and you can
      scarcely believe that the result of the trial is a matter of life or death
      to one wretched being present. But turn your eyes to the dock; watch the
      prisoner attentively for a few moments; and the fact is before you, in all
      its painful reality. Mark how restlessly he has been engaged for the last
      ten minutes, in forming all sorts of fantastic figures with the herbs
      which are strewed upon the ledge before him; observe the ashy paleness of
      his face when a particular witness appears, and how he changes his
      position and wipes his clammy forehead, and feverish hands, when the case
      for the prosecution is closed, as if it were a relief to him to feel that
      the jury knew the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defence is concluded; the judge proceeds to sum up the evidence; and
      the prisoner watches the countenances of the jury, as a dying man,
      clinging to life to the very last, vainly looks in the face of his
      physician for a slight ray of hope. They turn round to consult; you can
      almost hear the man's heart beat, as he bites the stalk of rosemary, with
      a desperate effort to appear composed. They resume their places-a dead
      silence prevails as the foreman delivers in the verdict-'Guilty!' A shriek
      bursts from a female in the gallery; the prisoner casts one look at the
      quarter from whence the noise proceeded; and is immediately hurried from
      the dock by the gaoler. The clerk directs one of the officers of the Court
      to 'take the woman out,' and fresh business is proceeded with, as if
      nothing had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      No imaginary contrast to a case like this, could be as complete as that
      which is constantly presented in the New Court, the gravity of which is
      frequently disturbed in no small degree, by the cunning and pertinacity of
      juvenile offenders. A boy of thirteen is tried, say for picking the pocket
      of some subject of her Majesty, and the offence is about as clearly proved
      as an offence can be. He is called upon for his defence, and contents
      himself with a little declamation about the jurymen and his
      country-asserts that all the witnesses have committed perjury, and hints
      that the police force generally have entered into a conspiracy 'again'
      him. However probable this statement may be, it fails to convince the
      Court, and some such scene as the following then takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
      Court: Have you any witnesses to speak to your character, boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Boy: Yes, my Lord; fifteen gen'lm'n is a vaten outside, and vos a vaten
      all day yesterday, vich they told me the night afore my trial vos a comin'
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Court. Inquire for these witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, a stout beadle runs out, and vociferates for the witnesses at the
      very top of his voice; for you hear his cry grow fainter and fainter as he
      descends the steps into the court-yard below. After an absence of five
      minutes, he returns, very warm and hoarse, and informs the Court of what
      it knew perfectly well before-namely, that there are no such witnesses in
      attendance. Hereupon, the boy sets up a most awful howling; screws the
      lower part of the palms of his hands into the corners of his eyes; and
      endeavours to look the picture of injured innocence. The jury at once find
      him 'guilty,' and his endeavours to squeeze out a tear or two are
      redoubled. The governor of the gaol then states, in reply to an inquiry
      from the bench, that the prisoner has been under his care twice before.
      This the urchin resolutely denies in some such terms as-'S'elp me,
      gen'lm'n, I never vos in trouble afore-indeed, my Lord, I never vos. It's
      all a howen to my having a twin brother, vich has wrongfully got into
      trouble, and vich is so exactly like me, that no vun ever knows the
      difference atween us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This representation, like the defence, fails in producing the desired
      effect, and the boy is sentenced, perhaps, to seven years' transportation.
      Finding it impossible to excite compassion, he gives vent to his feelings
      in an imprecation bearing reference to the eyes of 'old big vig!' and as
      he declines to take the trouble of walking from the dock, is forthwith
      carried out, congratulating himself on having succeeded in giving
      everybody as much trouble as possible.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV-A VISIT TO NEWGATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      'The force of habit' is a trite phrase in everybody's mouth; and it is not
      a little remarkable that those who use it most as applied to others,
      unconsciously afford in their own persons singular examples of the power
      which habit and custom exercise over the minds of men, and of the little
      reflection they are apt to bestow on subjects with which every day's
      experience has rendered them familiar. If Bedlam could be suddenly removed
      like another Aladdin's palace, and set down on the space now occupied by
      Newgate, scarcely one man out of a hundred, whose road to business every
      morning lies through Newgate-street, or the Old Bailey, would pass the
      building without bestowing a hasty glance on its small, grated windows,
      and a transient thought upon the condition of the unhappy beings immured
      in its dismal cells; and yet these same men, day by day, and hour by hour,
      pass and repass this gloomy depository of the guilt and misery of London,
      in one perpetual stream of life and bustle, utterly unmindful of the
      throng of wretched creatures pent up within it-nay, not even knowing, or
      if they do, not heeding, the fact, that as they pass one particular angle
      of the massive wall with a light laugh or a merry whistle, they stand
      within one yard of a fellow-creature, bound and helpless, whose hours are
      numbered, from whom the last feeble ray of hope has fled for ever, and
      whose miserable career will shortly terminate in a violent and shameful
      death. Contact with death even in its least terrible shape, is solemn and
      appalling. How much more awful is it to reflect on this near vicinity to
      the dying-to men in full health and vigour, in the flower of youth or the
      prime of life, with all their faculties and perceptions as acute and
      perfect as your own; but dying, nevertheless-dying as surely-with the hand
      of death imprinted upon them as indelibly-as if mortal disease had wasted
      their frames to shadows, and corruption had already begun!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with some such thoughts as these that we determined, not many weeks
      since, to visit the interior of Newgate-in an amateur capacity, of course;
      and, having carried our intention into effect, we proceed to lay its
      results before our readers, in the hope-founded more upon the nature of
      the subject, than on any presumptuous confidence in our own descriptive
      powers-that this paper may not be found wholly devoid of interest. We have
      only to premise, that we do not intend to fatigue the reader with any
      statistical accounts of the prison; they will be found at length in
      numerous reports of numerous committees, and a variety of authorities of
      equal weight. We took no notes, made no memoranda, measured none of the
      yards, ascertained the exact number of inches in no particular room: are
      unable even to report of how many apartments the gaol is composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw the prison, and saw the prisoners; and what we did see, and what we
      thought, we will tell at once in our own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered our credentials to the servant who answered our knock at
      the door of the governor's house, we were ushered into the 'office;' a
      little room, on the right-hand side as you enter, with two windows looking
      into the Old Bailey: fitted up like an ordinary attorney's office, or
      merchant's counting-house, with the usual fixtures-a wainscoted partition,
      a shelf or two, a desk, a couple of stools, a pair of clerks, an almanack,
      a clock, and a few maps. After a little delay, occasioned by sending into
      the interior of the prison for the officer whose duty it was to conduct
      us, that functionary arrived; a respectable-looking man of about two or
      three and fifty, in a broad- brimmed hat, and full suit of black, who, but
      for his keys, would have looked quite as much like a clergyman as a
      turnkey. We were disappointed; he had not even top-boots on. Following our
      conductor by a door opposite to that at which we had entered, we arrived
      at a small room, without any other furniture than a little desk, with a
      book for visitors' autographs, and a shelf, on which were a few boxes for
      papers, and casts of the heads and faces of the two notorious murderers,
      Bishop and Williams; the former, in particular, exhibiting a style of head
      and set of features, which might have afforded sufficient moral grounds
      for his instant execution at any time, even had there been no other
      evidence against him. Leaving this room also, by an opposite door, we
      found ourself in the lodge which opens on the Old Bailey; one side of
      which is plentifully garnished with a choice collection of heavy sets of
      irons, including those worn by the redoubtable Jack Sheppard-genuine; and
      those said to have been graced by the sturdy limbs of the no less
      celebrated Dick Turpin-doubtful. From this lodge, a heavy oaken gate,
      bound with iron, studded with nails of the same material, and guarded by
      another turnkey, opens on a few steps, if we remember right, which
      terminate in a narrow and dismal stone passage, running parallel with the
      Old Bailey, and leading to the different yards, through a number of
      tortuous and intricate windings, guarded in their turn by huge gates and
      gratings, whose appearance is sufficient to dispel at once the slightest
      hope of escape that any new-comer may have entertained; and the very
      recollection of which, on eventually traversing the place again, involves
      one in a maze of confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to explain here, that the buildings in the prison, or in
      other words the different wards-form a square, of which the four sides
      abut respectively on the Old Bailey, the old College of Physicians (now
      forming a part of Newgate-market), the Sessions-house, and Newgate-
      street. The intermediate space is divided into several paved yards, in
      which the prisoners take such air and exercise as can be had in such a
      place. These yards, with the exception of that in which prisoners under
      sentence of death are confined (of which we shall presently give a more
      detailed description), run parallel with Newgate-street, and consequently
      from the Old Bailey, as it were, to Newgate-market. The women's side is in
      the right wing of the prison nearest the Sessions- house. As we were
      introduced into this part of the building first, we will adopt the same
      order, and introduce our readers to it also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the right, then, down the passage to which we just now
      adverted, omitting any mention of intervening gates-for if we noticed
      every gate that was unlocked for us to pass through, and locked again as
      soon as we had passed, we should require a gate at every comma-we came to
      a door composed of thick bars of wood, through which were discernible,
      passing to and fro in a narrow yard, some twenty women: the majority of
      whom, however, as soon as they were aware of the presence of strangers,
      retreated to their wards. One side of this yard is railed off at a
      considerable distance, and formed into a kind of iron cage, about five
      feet ten inches in height, roofed at the top, and defended in front by
      iron bars, from which the friends of the female prisoners communicate with
      them. In one corner of this singular-looking den, was a yellow, haggard,
      decrepit old woman, in a tattered gown that had once been black, and the
      remains of an old straw bonnet, with faded ribbon of the same hue, in
      earnest conversation with a young girl-a prisoner, of course-of about
      two-and-twenty. It is impossible to imagine a more poverty-stricken
      object, or a creature so borne down in soul and body, by excess of misery
      and destitution, as the old woman. The girl was a good-looking, robust
      female, with a profusion of hair streaming about in the wind-for she had
      no bonnet on-and a man's silk pocket-handkerchief loosely thrown over a
      most ample pair of shoulders. The old woman was talking in that low,
      stifled tone of voice which tells so forcibly of mental anguish; and every
      now and then burst into an irrepressible sharp, abrupt cry of grief, the
      most distressing sound that ears can hear. The girl was perfectly unmoved.
      Hardened beyond all hope of redemption, she listened doggedly to her
      mother's entreaties, whatever they were: and, beyond inquiring after
      'Jem,' and eagerly catching at the few halfpence her miserable parent had
      brought her, took no more apparent interest in the conversation than the
      most unconcerned spectators. Heaven knows there were enough of them, in
      the persons of the other prisoners in the yard, who were no more concerned
      by what was passing before their eyes, and within their hearing, than if
      they were blind and deaf. Why should they be? Inside the prison, and out,
      such scenes were too familiar to them, to excite even a passing thought,
      unless of ridicule or contempt for feelings which they had long since
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little farther on, a squalid-looking woman in a slovenly, thick-
      bordered cap, with her arms muffled in a large red shawl, the fringed ends
      of which straggled nearly to the bottom of a dirty white apron, was
      communicating some instructions to her visitor-her daughter evidently. The
      girl was thinly clad, and shaking with the cold. Some ordinary word of
      recognition passed between her and her mother when she appeared at the
      grating, but neither hope, condolence, regret, nor affection was expressed
      on either side. The mother whispered her instructions, and the girl
      received them with her pinched-up, half-starved features twisted into an
      expression of careful cunning. It was some scheme for the woman's defence
      that she was disclosing, perhaps; and a sullen smile came over the girl's
      face for an instant, as if she were pleased: not so much at the
      probability of her mother's liberation, as at the chance of her 'getting
      off' in spite of her prosecutors. The dialogue was soon concluded; and
      with the same careless indifference with which they had approached each
      other, the mother turned towards the inner end of the yard, and the girl
      to the gate at which she had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl belonged to a class-unhappily but too extensive-the very
      existence of which, should make men's hearts bleed. Barely past her
      childhood, it required but a glance to discover that she was one of those
      children, born and bred in neglect and vice, who have never known what
      childhood is: who have never been taught to love and court a parent's
      smile, or to dread a parent's frown. The thousand nameless endearments of
      childhood, its gaiety and its innocence, are alike unknown to them. They
      have entered at once upon the stern realities and miseries of life, and to
      their better nature it is almost hopeless to appeal in after-times, by any
      of the references which will awaken, if it be only for a moment, some good
      feeling in ordinary bosoms, however corrupt they may have become. Talk to
      them of parental solicitude, the happy days of childhood, and the merry
      games of infancy! Tell them of hunger and the streets, beggary and
      stripes, the gin-shop, the station- house, and the pawnbroker's, and they
      will understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three women were standing at different parts of the grating,
      conversing with their friends, but a very large proportion of the
      prisoners appeared to have no friends at all, beyond such of their old
      companions as might happen to be within the walls. So, passing hastily
      down the yard, and pausing only for an instant to notice the little
      incidents we have just recorded, we were conducted up a clean and well-
      lighted flight of stone stairs to one of the wards. There are several in
      this part of the building, but a description of one is a description of
      the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a spacious, bare, whitewashed apartment, lighted, of course, by
      windows looking into the interior of the prison, but far more light and
      airy than one could reasonably expect to find in such a situation. There
      was a large fire with a deal table before it, round which ten or a dozen
      women were seated on wooden forms at dinner. Along both sides of the room
      ran a shelf; below it, at regular intervals, a row of large hooks were
      fixed in the wall, on each of which was hung the sleeping mat of a
      prisoner: her rug and blanket being folded up, and placed on the shelf
      above. At night, these mats are placed on the floor, each beneath the hook
      on which it hangs during the day; and the ward is thus made to answer the
      purposes both of a day-room and sleeping apartment. Over the fireplace,
      was a large sheet of pasteboard, on which were displayed a variety of
      texts from Scripture, which were also scattered about the room in scraps
      about the size and shape of the copy-slips which are used in schools. On
      the table was a sufficient provision of a kind of stewed beef and brown
      bread, in pewter dishes, which are kept perfectly bright, and displayed on
      shelves in great order and regularity when they are not in use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women rose hastily, on our entrance, and retired in a hurried manner
      to either side of the fireplace. They were all cleanly-many of them
      decently-attired, and there was nothing peculiar, either in their
      appearance or demeanour. One or two resumed the needlework which they had
      probably laid aside at the commencement of their meal; others gazed at the
      visitors with listless curiosity; and a few retired behind their
      companions to the very end of the room, as if desirous to avoid even the
      casual observation of the strangers. Some old Irish women, both in this
      and other wards, to whom the thing was no novelty, appeared perfectly
      indifferent to our presence, and remained standing close to the seats from
      which they had just risen; but the general feeling among the females
      seemed to be one of uneasiness during the period of our stay among them:
      which was very brief. Not a word was uttered during the time of our
      remaining, unless, indeed, by the wardswoman in reply to some question
      which we put to the turnkey who accompanied us. In every ward on the
      female side, a wardswoman is appointed to preserve order, and a similar
      regulation is adopted among the males. The wardsmen and wardswomen are all
      prisoners, selected for good conduct. They alone are allowed the privilege
      of sleeping on bedsteads; a small stump bedstead being placed in every
      ward for that purpose. On both sides of the gaol, is a small
      receiving-room, to which prisoners are conducted on their first reception,
      and whence they cannot be removed until they have been examined by the
      surgeon of the prison. <a href="#linknote-161" id="linknoteref-161"><small>161</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Retracing our steps to the dismal passage in which we found ourselves at
      first (and which, by-the-bye, contains three or four dark cells for the
      accommodation of refractory prisoners), we were led through a narrow yard
      to the 'school'-a portion of the prison set apart for boys under fourteen
      years of age. In a tolerable-sized room, in which were writing-materials
      and some copy-books, was the schoolmaster, with a couple of his pupils;
      the remainder having been fetched from an adjoining apartment, the whole
      were drawn up in line for our inspection. There were fourteen of them in
      all, some with shoes, some without; some in pinafores without jackets,
      others in jackets without pinafores, and one in scarce anything at all.
      The whole number, without an exception we believe, had been committed for
      trial on charges of pocket-picking; and fourteen such terrible little
      faces we never beheld.-There was not one redeeming feature among them-not
      a glance of honesty-not a wink expressive of anything but the gallows and
      the hulks, in the whole collection. As to anything like shame or
      contrition, that was entirely out of the question. They were evidently
      quite gratified at being thought worth the trouble of looking at; their
      idea appeared to be, that we had come to see Newgate as a grand affair,
      and that they were an indispensable part of the show; and every boy as he
      'fell in' to the line, actually seemed as pleased and important as if he
      had done something excessively meritorious in getting there at all. We
      never looked upon a more disagreeable sight, because we never saw fourteen
      such hopeless creatures of neglect, before.
    </p>
    <p>
      On either side of the school-yard is a yard for men, in one of which-that
      towards Newgate-street-prisoners of the more respectable class are
      confined. Of the other, we have little description to offer, as the
      different wards necessarily partake of the same character. They are
      provided, like the wards on the women's side, with mats and rugs, which
      are disposed of in the same manner during the day; the only very striking
      difference between their appearance and that of the wards inhabited by the
      females, is the utter absence of any employment. Huddled together on two
      opposite forms, by the fireside, sit twenty men perhaps; here, a boy in
      livery; there, a man in a rough great-coat and top-boots; farther on, a
      desperate-looking fellow in his shirt-sleeves, with an old Scotch cap upon
      his shaggy head; near him again, a tall ruffian, in a smock-frock; next to
      him, a miserable being of distressed appearance, with his head resting on
      his hand;-all alike in one respect, all idle and listless. When they do
      leave the fire, sauntering moodily about, lounging in the window, or
      leaning against the wall, vacantly swinging their bodies to and fro. With
      the exception of a man reading an old newspaper, in two or three
      instances, this was the case in every ward we entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only communication these men have with their friends, is through two
      close iron gratings, with an intermediate space of about a yard in width
      between the two, so that nothing can be handed across, nor can the
      prisoner have any communication by touch with the person who visits him.
      The married men have a separate grating, at which to see their wives, but
      its construction is the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prison chapel is situated at the back of the governor's house: the
      latter having no windows looking into the interior of the prison. Whether
      the associations connected with the place-the knowledge that here a
      portion of the burial service is, on some dreadful occasions, performed
      over the quick and not upon the dead-cast over it a still more gloomy and
      sombre air than art has imparted to it, we know not, but its appearance is
      very striking. There is something in a silent and deserted place of
      worship, solemn and impressive at any time; and the very dissimilarity of
      this one from any we have been accustomed to, only enhances the
      impression. The meanness of its appointments-the bare and scanty pulpit,
      with the paltry painted pillars on either side-the women's gallery with
      its great heavy curtain-the men's with its unpainted benches and dingy
      front-the tottering little table at the altar, with the commandments on
      the wall above it, scarcely legible through lack of paint, and dust and
      damp-so unlike the velvet and gilding, the marble and wood, of a modern
      church-are strange and striking. There is one object, too, which rivets
      the attention and fascinates the gaze, and from which we may turn
      horror-stricken in vain, for the recollection of it will haunt us, waking
      and sleeping, for a long time afterwards. Immediately below the
      reading-desk, on the floor of the chapel, and forming the most conspicuous
      object in its little area, is the condemned pew; a huge black pen, in
      which the wretched people, who are singled out for death, are placed on
      the Sunday preceding their execution, in sight of all their
      fellow-prisoners, from many of whom they may have been separated but a
      week before, to hear prayers for their own souls, to join in the responses
      of their own burial service, and to listen to an address, warning their
      recent companions to take example by their fate, and urging themselves,
      while there is yet time-nearly four-and-twenty hours-to 'turn, and flee
      from the wrath to come!' Imagine what have been the feelings of the men
      whom that fearful pew has enclosed, and of whom, between the gallows and
      the knife, no mortal remnant may now remain! Think of the hopeless
      clinging to life to the last, and the wild despair, far exceeding in
      anguish the felon's death itself, by which they have heard the certainty
      of their speedy transmission to another world, with all their crimes upon
      their heads, rung into their ears by the officiating clergyman!
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time-and at no distant period either-the coffins of the men about
      to be executed, were placed in that pew, upon the seat by their side,
      during the whole service. It may seem incredible, but it is true. Let us
      hope that the increased spirit of civilisation and humanity which
      abolished this frightful and degrading custom, may extend itself to other
      usages equally barbarous; usages which have not even the plea of utility
      in their defence, as every year's experience has shown them to be more and
      more inefficacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the chapel, descending to the passage so frequently alluded to,
      and crossing the yard before noticed as being allotted to prisoners of a
      more respectable description than the generality of men confined here, the
      visitor arrives at a thick iron gate of great size and strength. Having
      been admitted through it by the turnkey on duty, he turns sharp round to
      the left, and pauses before another gate; and, having passed this last
      barrier, he stands in the most terrible part of this gloomy building-the
      condemned ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The press-yard, well known by name to newspaper readers, from its frequent
      mention in accounts of executions, is at the corner of the building, and
      next to the ordinary's house, in Newgate-street: running from
      Newgate-street, towards the centre of the prison, parallel with
      Newgate-market. It is a long, narrow court, of which a portion of the wall
      in Newgate-street forms one end, and the gate the other. At the upper end,
      on the left hand-that is, adjoining the wall in Newgate- street-is a
      cistern of water, and at the bottom a double grating (of which the gate
      itself forms a part) similar to that before described. Through these
      grates the prisoners are allowed to see their friends; a turnkey always
      remaining in the vacant space between, during the whole interview.
      Immediately on the right as you enter, is a building containing the
      press-room, day-room, and cells; the yard is on every side surrounded by
      lofty walls guarded by chevaux de frise; and the whole is under the
      constant inspection of vigilant and experienced turnkeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first apartment into which we were conducted-which was at the top
      of a staircase, and immediately over the press-room-were five-and-twenty
      or thirty prisoners, all under sentence of death, awaiting the result of
      the recorder's report-men of all ages and appearances, from a hardened old
      offender with swarthy face and grizzly beard of three days' growth, to a
      handsome boy, not fourteen years old, and of singularly youthful
      appearance even for that age, who had been condemned for burglary. There
      was nothing remarkable in the appearance of these prisoners. One or two
      decently-dressed men were brooding with a dejected air over the fire;
      several little groups of two or three had been engaged in conversation at
      the upper end of the room, or in the windows; and the remainder were
      crowded round a young man seated at a table, who appeared to be engaged in
      teaching the younger ones to write. The room was large, airy, and clean.
      There was very little anxiety or mental suffering depicted in the
      countenance of any of the men;-they had all been sentenced to death, it is
      true, and the recorder's report had not yet been made; but, we question
      whether there was a man among them, notwithstanding, who did not know that
      although he had undergone the ceremony, it never was intended that his
      life should be sacrificed. On the table lay a Testament, but there were no
      tokens of its having been in recent use.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the press-room below, were three men, the nature of whose offence
      rendered it necessary to separate them, even from their companions in
      guilt. It is a long, sombre room, with two windows sunk into the stone
      wall, and here the wretched men are pinioned on the morning of their
      execution, before moving towards the scaffold. The fate of one of these
      prisoners was uncertain; some mitigatory circumstances having come to
      light since his trial, which had been humanely represented in the proper
      quarter. The other two had nothing to expect from the mercy of the crown;
      their doom was sealed; no plea could be urged in extenuation of their
      crime, and they well knew that for them there was no hope in this world.
      'The two short ones,' the turnkey whispered, 'were dead men.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The man to whom we have alluded as entertaining some hopes of escape, was
      lounging, at the greatest distance he could place between himself and his
      companions, in the window nearest to the door. He was probably aware of
      our approach, and had assumed an air of courageous indifference; his face
      was purposely averted towards the window, and he stirred not an inch while
      we were present. The other two men were at the upper end of the room. One
      of them, who was imperfectly seen in the dim light, had his back towards
      us, and was stooping over the fire, with his right arm on the
      mantel-piece, and his head sunk upon it. The other was leaning on the sill
      of the farthest window. The light fell full upon him, and communicated to
      his pale, haggard face, and disordered hair, an appearance which, at that
      distance, was ghastly. His cheek rested upon his hand; and, with his face
      a little raised, and his eyes wildly staring before him, he seemed to be
      unconsciously intent on counting the chinks in the opposite wall. We
      passed this room again afterwards. The first man was pacing up and down
      the court with a firm military step-he had been a soldier in the
      foot-guards-and a cloth cap jauntily thrown on one side of his head. He
      bowed respectfully to our conductor, and the salute was returned. The
      other two still remained in the positions we have described, and were as
      motionless as statues. <a href="#linknote-165" id="linknoteref-165"><small>165</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A few paces up the yard, and forming a continuation of the building, in
      which are the two rooms we have just quitted, lie the condemned cells. The
      entrance is by a narrow and obscure stair-case leading to a dark passage,
      in which a charcoal stove casts a lurid tint over the objects in its
      immediate vicinity, and diffuses something like warmth around. From the
      left-hand side of this passage, the massive door of every cell on the
      story opens; and from it alone can they be approached. There are three of
      these passages, and three of these ranges of cells, one above the other;
      but in size, furniture and appearance, they are all precisely alike. Prior
      to the recorder's report being made, all the prisoners under sentence of
      death are removed from the day-room at five o'clock in the afternoon, and
      locked up in these cells, where they are allowed a candle until ten
      o'clock; and here they remain until seven next morning. When the warrant
      for a prisoner's execution arrives, he is removed to the cells and
      confined in one of them until he leaves it for the scaffold. He is at
      liberty to walk in the yard; but, both in his walks and in his cell, he is
      constantly attended by a turnkey who never leaves him on any pretence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered the first cell. It was a stone dungeon, eight feet long by six
      wide, with a bench at the upper end, under which were a common rug, a
      bible, and prayer-book. An iron candlestick was fixed into the wall at the
      side; and a small high window in the back admitted as much air and light
      as could struggle in between a double row of heavy, crossed iron bars. It
      contained no other furniture of any description.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceive the situation of a man, spending his last night on earth in this
      cell. Buoyed up with some vague and undefined hope of reprieve, he knew
      not why-indulging in some wild and visionary idea of escaping, he knew not
      how-hour after hour of the three preceding days allowed him for
      preparation, has fled with a speed which no man living would deem
      possible, for none but this dying man can know. He has wearied his friends
      with entreaties, exhausted the attendants with importunities, neglected in
      his feverish restlessness the timely warnings of his spiritual consoler;
      and, now that the illusion is at last dispelled, now that eternity is
      before him and guilt behind, now that his fears of death amount almost to
      madness, and an overwhelming sense of his helpless, hopeless state rushes
      upon him, he is lost and stupefied, and has neither thoughts to turn to,
      nor power to call upon, the Almighty Being, from whom alone he can seek
      mercy and forgiveness, and before whom his repentance can alone avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours have glided by, and still he sits upon the same stone bench with
      folded arms, heedless alike of the fast decreasing time before him, and
      the urgent entreaties of the good man at his side. The feeble light is
      wasting gradually, and the deathlike stillness of the street without,
      broken only by the rumbling of some passing vehicle which echoes
      mournfully through the empty yards, warns him that the night is waning
      fast away. The deep bell of St. Paul's strikes-one! He heard it; it has
      roused him. Seven hours left! He paces the narrow limits of his cell with
      rapid strides, cold drops of terror starting on his forehead, and every
      muscle of his frame quivering with agony. Seven hours! He suffers himself
      to be led to his seat, mechanically takes the bible which is placed in his
      hand, and tries to read and listen. No: his thoughts will wander. The book
      is torn and soiled by use-and like the book he read his lessons in, at
      school, just forty years ago! He has never bestowed a thought upon it,
      perhaps, since he left it as a child: and yet the place, the time, the
      room-nay, the very boys he played with, crowd as vividly before him as if
      they were scenes of yesterday; and some forgotten phrase, some childish
      word, rings in his ears like the echo of one uttered but a minute since.
      The voice of the clergyman recalls him to himself. He is reading from the
      sacred book its solemn promises of pardon for repentance, and its awful
      denunciation of obdurate men. He falls upon his knees and clasps his hands
      to pray. Hush! what sound was that? He starts upon his feet. It cannot be
      two yet. Hark! Two quarters have struck;-the third-the fourth. It is! Six
      hours left. Tell him not of repentance! Six hours' repentance for eight
      times six years of guilt and sin! He buries his face in his hands, and
      throws himself on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worn with watching and excitement, he sleeps, and the same unsettled state
      of mind pursues him in his dreams. An insupportable load is taken from his
      breast; he is walking with his wife in a pleasant field, with the bright
      sky above them, and a fresh and boundless prospect on every side-how
      different from the stone walls of Newgate! She is looking-not as she did
      when he saw her for the last time in that dreadful place, but as she used
      when he loved her-long, long ago, before misery and ill- treatment had
      altered her looks, and vice had changed his nature, and she is leaning
      upon his arm, and looking up into his face with tenderness and
      affection-and he does not strike her now, nor rudely shake her from him.
      And oh! how glad he is to tell her all he had forgotten in that last
      hurried interview, and to fall on his knees before her and fervently
      beseech her pardon for all the unkindness and cruelty that wasted her form
      and broke her heart! The scene suddenly changes. He is on his trial again:
      there are the judge and jury, and prosecutors, and witnesses, just as they
      were before. How full the court is-what a sea of heads-with a gallows,
      too, and a scaffold-and how all those people stare at him! Verdict,
      'Guilty.' No matter; he will escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night is dark and cold, the gates have been left open, and in an
      instant he is in the street, flying from the scene of his imprisonment
      like the wind. The streets are cleared, the open fields are gained and the
      broad, wide country lies before him. Onward he dashes in the midst of
      darkness, over hedge and ditch, through mud and pool, bounding from spot
      to spot with a speed and lightness, astonishing even to himself. At length
      he pauses; he must be safe from pursuit now; he will stretch himself on
      that bank and sleep till sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A period of unconsciousness succeeds. He wakes, cold and wretched. The
      dull, gray light of morning is stealing into the cell, and falls upon the
      form of the attendant turnkey. Confused by his dreams, he starts from his
      uneasy bed in momentary uncertainty. It is but momentary. Every object in
      the narrow cell is too frightfully real to admit of doubt or mistake. He
      is the condemned felon again, guilty and despairing; and in two hours more
      will be dead.

      CHAPTER I-THOUGHTS ABOUT PEOPLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is strange with how little notice, good, bad, or indifferent, a man may
      live and die in London. He awakens no sympathy in the breast of any single
      person; his existence is a matter of interest to no one save himself; he
      cannot be said to be forgotten when he dies, for no one remembered him
      when he was alive. There is a numerous class of people in this great
      metropolis who seem not to possess a single friend, and whom nobody
      appears to care for. Urged by imperative necessity in the first instance,
      they have resorted to London in search of employment, and the means of
      subsistence. It is hard, we know, to break the ties which bind us to our
      homes and friends, and harder still to efface the thousand recollections
      of happy days and old times, which have been slumbering in our bosoms for
      years, and only rush upon the mind, to bring before it associations
      connected with the friends we have left, the scenes we have beheld too
      probably for the last time, and the hopes we once cherished, but may
      entertain no more. These men, however, happily for themselves, have long
      forgotten such thoughts. Old country friends have died or emigrated;
      former correspondents have become lost, like themselves, in the crowd and
      turmoil of some busy city; and they have gradually settled down into mere
      passive creatures of habit and endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were seated in the enclosure of St. James's Park the other day, when
      our attention was attracted by a man whom we immediately put down in our
      own mind as one of this class. He was a tall, thin, pale person, in a
      black coat, scanty gray trousers, little pinched-up gaiters, and brown
      beaver gloves. He had an umbrella in his hand-not for use, for the day was
      fine-but, evidently, because he always carried one to the office in the
      morning. He walked up and down before the little patch of grass on which
      the chairs are placed for hire, not as if he were doing it for pleasure or
      recreation, but as if it were a matter of compulsion, just as he would
      walk to the office every morning from the back settlements of Islington.
      It was Monday; he had escaped for four-and-twenty hours from the thraldom
      of the desk; and was walking here for exercise and amusement-perhaps for
      the first time in his life. We were inclined to think he had never had a
      holiday before, and that he did not know what to do with himself. Children
      were playing on the grass; groups of people were loitering about, chatting
      and laughing; but the man walked steadily up and down, unheeding and
      unheeded his spare, pale face looking as if it were incapable of bearing
      the expression of curiosity or interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the man's manner and appearance which told us, we
      fancied, his whole life, or rather his whole day, for a man of this sort
      has no variety of days. We thought we almost saw the dingy little back
      office into which he walks every morning, hanging his hat on the same peg,
      and placing his legs beneath the same desk: first, taking off that black
      coat which lasts the year through, and putting on the one which did duty
      last year, and which he keeps in his desk to save the other. There he sits
      till five o'clock, working on, all day, as regularly as the dial over the
      mantel-piece, whose loud ticking is as monotonous as his whole existence:
      only raising his head when some one enters the counting-house, or when, in
      the midst of some difficult calculation, he looks up to the ceiling as if
      there were inspiration in the dusty skylight with a green knot in the
      centre of every pane of glass. About five, or half-past, he slowly
      dismounts from his accustomed stool, and again changing his coat, proceeds
      to his usual dining-place, somewhere near Bucklersbury. The waiter recites
      the bill of fare in a rather confidential manner-for he is a regular
      customer-and after inquiring 'What's in the best cut?' and 'What was up
      last?' he orders a small plate of roast beef, with greens, and half-a-pint
      of porter. He has a small plate to-day, because greens are a penny more
      than potatoes, and he had 'two breads' yesterday, with the additional
      enormity of 'a cheese' the day before. This important point settled, he
      hangs up his hat-he took it off the moment he sat down-and bespeaks the
      paper after the next gentleman. If he can get it while he is at dinner, he
      eats with much greater zest; balancing it against the water-bottle, and
      eating a bit of beef, and reading a line or two, alternately. Exactly at
      five minutes before the hour is up, he produces a shilling, pays the
      reckoning, carefully deposits the change in his waistcoat-pocket (first
      deducting a penny for the waiter), and returns to the office, from which,
      if it is not foreign post night, he again sallies forth, in about half an
      hour. He then walks home, at his usual pace, to his little back room at
      Islington, where he has his tea; perhaps solacing himself during the meal
      with the conversation of his landlady's little boy, whom he occasionally
      rewards with a penny, for solving problems in simple addition. Sometimes,
      there is a letter or two to take up to his employer's, in Russell-square;
      and then, the wealthy man of business, hearing his voice, calls out from
      the dining-parlour,-'Come in, Mr. Smith:' and Mr. Smith, putting his hat
      at the feet of one of the hall chairs, walks timidly in, and being
      condescendingly desired to sit down, carefully tucks his legs under his
      chair, and sits at a considerable distance from the table while he drinks
      the glass of sherry which is poured out for him by the eldest boy, and
      after drinking which, he backs and slides out of the room, in a state of
      nervous agitation from which he does not perfectly recover, until he finds
      himself once more in the Islington-road. Poor, harmless creatures such men
      are; contented but not happy; broken-spirited and humbled, they may feel
      no pain, but they never know pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare these men with another class of beings who, like them, have
      neither friend nor companion, but whose position in society is the result
      of their own choice. These are generally old fellows with white heads and
      red faces, addicted to port wine and Hessian boots, who from some cause,
      real or imaginary-generally the former, the excellent reason being that
      they are rich, and their relations poor-grow suspicious of everybody, and
      do the misanthropical in chambers, taking great delight in thinking
      themselves unhappy, and making everybody they come near, miserable. You
      may see such men as these, anywhere; you will know them at coffee-houses
      by their discontented exclamations and the luxury of their dinners; at
      theatres, by their always sitting in the same place and looking with a
      jaundiced eye on all the young people near them; at church, by the
      pomposity with which they enter, and the loud tone in which they repeat
      the responses; at parties, by their getting cross at whist and hating
      music. An old fellow of this kind will have his chambers splendidly
      furnished, and collect books, plate, and pictures about him in profusion;
      not so much for his own gratification, as to be superior to those who have
      the desire, but not the means, to compete with him. He belongs to two or
      three clubs, and is envied, and flattered, and hated by the members of
      them all. Sometimes he will be appealed to by a poor relation-a married
      nephew perhaps-for some little assistance: and then he will declaim with
      honest indignation on the improvidence of young married people, the
      worthlessness of a wife, the insolence of having a family, the atrocity of
      getting into debt with a hundred and twenty-five pounds a year, and other
      unpardonable crimes; winding up his exhortations with a complacent review
      of his own conduct, and a delicate allusion to parochial relief. He dies,
      some day after dinner, of apoplexy, having bequeathed his property to a
      Public Society, and the Institution erects a tablet to his memory,
      expressive of their admiration of his Christian conduct in this world, and
      their comfortable conviction of his happiness in the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, next to our very particular friends, hackney-coachmen, cabmen and
      cads, whom we admire in proportion to the extent of their cool impudence
      and perfect self-possession, there is no class of people who amuse us more
      than London apprentices. They are no longer an organised body, bound down
      by solemn compact to terrify his Majesty's subjects whenever it pleases
      them to take offence in their heads and staves in their hands. They are
      only bound, now, by indentures, and, as to their valour, it is easily
      restrained by the wholesome dread of the New Police, and a perspective
      view of a damp station-house, terminating in a police-office and a
      reprimand. They are still, however, a peculiar class, and not the less
      pleasant for being inoffensive. Can any one fail to have noticed them in
      the streets on Sunday? And were there ever such harmless efforts at the
      grand and magnificent as the young fellows display! We walked down the
      Strand, a Sunday or two ago, behind a little group; and they furnished
      food for our amusement the whole way. They had come out of some part of
      the city; it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; and they
      were on their way to the Park. There were four of them, all arm-in-arm,
      with white kid gloves like so many bridegrooms, light trousers of
      unprecedented patterns, and coats for which the English language has yet
      no name-a kind of cross between a great-coat and a surtout, with the
      collar of the one, the skirts of the other, and pockets peculiar to
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the gentlemen carried a thick stick, with a large tassel at the
      top, which he occasionally twirled gracefully round; and the whole four,
      by way of looking easy and unconcerned, were walking with a paralytic
      swagger irresistibly ludicrous. One of the party had a watch about the
      size and shape of a reasonable Ribstone pippin, jammed into his
      waistcoat-pocket, which he carefully compared with the clocks at St.
      Clement's and the New Church, the illuminated clock at Exeter 'Change, the
      clock of St. Martin's Church, and the clock of the Horse Guards. When they
      at last arrived in St. James's Park, the member of the party who had the
      best-made boots on, hired a second chair expressly for his feet, and flung
      himself on this two-pennyworth of sylvan luxury with an air which levelled
      all distinctions between Brookes's and Snooks's, Crockford's and Bagnigge
      Wells.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may smile at such people, but they can never excite our anger. They are
      usually on the best terms with themselves, and it follows almost as a
      matter of course, in good humour with every one about them. Besides, they
      are always the faint reflection of higher lights; and, if they do display
      a little occasional foolery in their own proper persons, it is surely more
      tolerable than precocious puppyism in the Quadrant, whiskered dandyism in
      Regent-street and Pall-mall, or gallantry in its dotage anywhere.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II-A CHRISTMAS DINNER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christmas time! That man must be a misanthrope indeed, in whose breast
      something like a jovial feeling is not roused-in whose mind some pleasant
      associations are not awakened-by the recurrence of Christmas. There are
      people who will tell you that Christmas is not to them what it used to be;
      that each succeeding Christmas has found some cherished hope, or happy
      prospect, of the year before, dimmed or passed away; that the present only
      serves to remind them of reduced circumstances and straitened incomes-of
      the feasts they once bestowed on hollow friends, and of the cold looks
      that meet them now, in adversity and misfortune. Never heed such dismal
      reminiscences. There are few men who have lived long enough in the world,
      who cannot call up such thoughts any day in the year. Then do not select
      the merriest of the three hundred and sixty-five for your doleful
      recollections, but draw your chair nearer the blazing fire-fill the glass
      and send round the song-and if your room be smaller than it was a dozen
      years ago, or if your glass be filled with reeking punch, instead of
      sparkling wine, put a good face on the matter, and empty it off-hand, and
      fill another, and troll off the old ditty you used to sing, and thank God
      it's no worse. Look on the merry faces of your children (if you have any)
      as they sit round the fire. One little seat may be empty; one slight form
      that gladdened the father's heart, and roused the mother's pride to look
      upon, may not be there. Dwell not upon the past; think not that one short
      year ago, the fair child now resolving into dust, sat before you, with the
      bloom of health upon its cheek, and the gaiety of infancy in its joyous
      eye. Reflect upon your present blessings-of which every man has many-not
      on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some. Fill your glass
      again, with a merry face and contented heart. Our life on it, but your
      Christmas shall be merry, and your new year a happy one!
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can be insensible to the outpourings of good feeling, and the honest
      interchange of affectionate attachment, which abound at this season of the
      year? A Christmas family-party! We know nothing in nature more delightful!
      There seems a magic in the very name of Christmas. Petty jealousies and
      discords are forgotten; social feelings are awakened, in bosoms to which
      they have long been strangers; father and son, or brother and sister, who
      have met and passed with averted gaze, or a look of cold recognition, for
      months before, proffer and return the cordial embrace, and bury their past
      animosities in their present happiness. Kindly hearts that have yearned
      towards each other, but have been withheld by false notions of pride and
      self-dignity, are again reunited, and all is kindness and benevolence!
      Would that Christmas lasted the whole year through (as it ought), and that
      the prejudices and passions which deform our better nature, were never
      called into action among those to whom they should ever be strangers!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas family-party that we mean, is not a mere assemblage of
      relations, got up at a week or two's notice, originating this year, having
      no family precedent in the last, and not likely to be repeated in the
      next. No. It is an annual gathering of all the accessible members of the
      family, young or old, rich or poor; and all the children look forward to
      it, for two months beforehand, in a fever of anticipation. Formerly, it
      was held at grandpapa's; but grandpapa getting old, and grandmamma getting
      old too, and rather infirm, they have given up house- keeping, and
      domesticated themselves with uncle George; so, the party always takes
      place at uncle George's house, but grandmamma sends in most of the good
      things, and grandpapa always will toddle down, all the way to
      Newgate-market, to buy the turkey, which he engages a porter to bring home
      behind him in triumph, always insisting on the man's being rewarded with a
      glass of spirits, over and above his hire, to drink 'a merry Christmas and
      a happy new year' to aunt George. As to grandmamma, she is very secret and
      mysterious for two or three days beforehand, but not sufficiently so, to
      prevent rumours getting afloat that she has purchased a beautiful new cap
      with pink ribbons for each of the servants, together with sundry books,
      and pen-knives, and pencil-cases, for the younger branches; to say nothing
      of divers secret additions to the order originally given by aunt George at
      the pastry-cook's, such as another dozen of mince-pies for the dinner, and
      a large plum-cake for the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Christmas-eve, grandmamma is always in excellent spirits, and after
      employing all the children, during the day, in stoning the plums, and all
      that, insists, regularly every year, on uncle George coming down into the
      kitchen, taking off his coat, and stirring the pudding for half an hour or
      so, which uncle George good-humouredly does, to the vociferous delight of
      the children and servants. The evening concludes with a glorious game of
      blind-man's-buff, in an early stage of which grandpapa takes great care to
      be caught, in order that he may have an opportunity of displaying his
      dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning, the old couple, with as many of the children as
      the pew will hold, go to church in great state: leaving aunt George at
      home dusting decanters and filling casters, and uncle George carrying
      bottles into the dining-parlour, and calling for corkscrews, and getting
      into everybody's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the church-party return to lunch, grandpapa produces a small sprig of
      mistletoe from his pocket, and tempts the boys to kiss their little
      cousins under it-a proceeding which affords both the boys and the old
      gentleman unlimited satisfaction, but which rather outrages grandmamma's
      ideas of decorum, until grandpapa says, that when he was just thirteen
      years and three months old, he kissed grandmamma under a mistletoe too, on
      which the children clap their hands, and laugh very heartily, as do aunt
      George and uncle George; and grandmamma looks pleased, and says, with a
      benevolent smile, that grandpapa was an impudent young dog, on which the
      children laugh very heartily again, and grandpapa more heartily than any
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all these diversions are nothing to the subsequent excitement when
      grandmamma in a high cap, and slate-coloured silk gown; and grandpapa with
      a beautifully plaited shirt-frill, and white neckerchief; seat themselves
      on one side of the drawing-room fire, with uncle George's children and
      little cousins innumerable, seated in the front, waiting the arrival of
      the expected visitors. Suddenly a hackney-coach is heard to stop, and
      uncle George, who has been looking out of the window, exclaims 'Here's
      Jane!' on which the children rush to the door, and helter-skelter
      down-stairs; and uncle Robert and aunt Jane, and the dear little baby, and
      the nurse, and the whole party, are ushered up-stairs amidst tumultuous
      shouts of 'Oh, my!' from the children, and frequently repeated warnings
      not to hurt baby from the nurse. And grandpapa takes the child, and
      grandmamma kisses her daughter, and the confusion of this first entry has
      scarcely subsided, when some other aunts and uncles with more cousins
      arrive, and the grown-up cousins flirt with each other, and so do the
      little cousins too, for that matter, and nothing is to be heard but a
      confused din of talking, laughing, and merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hesitating double knock at the street-door, heard during a momentary
      pause in the conversation, excites a general inquiry of 'Who's that?' and
      two or three children, who have been standing at the window, announce in a
      low voice, that it's 'poor aunt Margaret.' Upon which, aunt George leaves
      the room to welcome the new-comer; and grandmamma draws herself up, rather
      stiff and stately; for Margaret married a poor man without her consent,
      and poverty not being a sufficiently weighty punishment for her offence,
      has been discarded by her friends, and debarred the society of her dearest
      relatives. But Christmas has come round, and the unkind feelings that have
      struggled against better dispositions during the year, have melted away
      before its genial influence, like half-formed ice beneath the morning sun.
      It is not difficult in a moment of angry feeling for a parent to denounce
      a disobedient child; but, to banish her at a period of general good-will
      and hilarity, from the hearth, round which she has sat on so many
      anniversaries of the same day, expanding by slow degrees from infancy to
      girlhood, and then bursting, almost imperceptibly, into a woman, is widely
      different. The air of conscious rectitude, and cold forgiveness, which the
      old lady has assumed, sits ill upon her; and when the poor girl is led in
      by her sister, pale in looks and broken in hope-not from poverty, for that
      she could bear, but from the consciousness of undeserved neglect, and
      unmerited unkindness-it is easy to see how much of it is assumed. A
      momentary pause succeeds; the girl breaks suddenly from her sister and
      throws herself, sobbing, on her mother's neck. The father steps hastily
      forward, and takes her husband's hand. Friends crowd round to offer their
      hearty congratulations, and happiness and harmony again prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the dinner, it's perfectly delightful-nothing goes wrong, and
      everybody is in the very best of spirits, and disposed to please and be
      pleased. Grandpapa relates a circumstantial account of the purchase of the
      turkey, with a slight digression relative to the purchase of previous
      turkeys, on former Christmas-days, which grandmamma corroborates in the
      minutest particular. Uncle George tells stories, and carves poultry, and
      takes wine, and jokes with the children at the side-table, and winks at
      the cousins that are making love, or being made love to, and exhilarates
      everybody with his good humour and hospitality; and when, at last, a stout
      servant staggers in with a gigantic pudding, with a sprig of holly in the
      top, there is such a laughing, and shouting, and clapping of little chubby
      hands, and kicking up of fat dumpy legs, as can only be equalled by the
      applause with which the astonishing feat of pouring lighted brandy into
      mince-pies, is received by the younger visitors. Then the dessert!-and the
      wine!-and the fun! Such beautiful speeches, and such songs, from aunt
      Margaret's husband, who turns out to be such a nice man, and so attentive
      to grandmamma! Even grandpapa not only sings his annual song with
      unprecedented vigour, but on being honoured with an unanimous encore,
      according to annual custom, actually comes out with a new one which nobody
      but grandmamma ever heard before; and a young scapegrace of a cousin, who
      has been in some disgrace with the old people, for certain heinous sins of
      omission and commission-neglecting to call, and persisting in drinking
      Burton Ale-astonishes everybody into convulsions of laughter by
      volunteering the most extraordinary comic songs that ever were heard. And
      thus the evening passes, in a strain of rational good-will and
      cheerfulness, doing more to awaken the sympathies of every member of the
      party in behalf of his neighbour, and to perpetuate their good feeling
      during the ensuing year, than half the homilies that have ever been
      written, by half the Divines that have ever lived.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III-THE NEW YEAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next to Christmas-day, the most pleasant annual epoch in existence is the
      advent of the New Year. There are a lachrymose set of people who usher in
      the New Year with watching and fasting, as if they were bound to attend as
      chief mourners at the obsequies of the old one. Now, we cannot but think
      it a great deal more complimentary, both to the old year that has rolled
      away, and to the New Year that is just beginning to dawn upon us, to see
      the old fellow out, and the new one in, with gaiety and glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must have been some few occurrences in the past year to which we can
      look back, with a smile of cheerful recollection, if not with a feeling of
      heartfelt thankfulness. And we are bound by every rule of justice and
      equity to give the New Year credit for being a good one, until he proves
      himself unworthy the confidence we repose in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is our view of the matter; and entertaining it, notwithstanding our
      respect for the old year, one of the few remaining moments of whose
      existence passes away with every word we write, here we are, seated by our
      fireside on this last night of the old year, one thousand eight hundred
      and thirty-six, penning this article with as jovial a face as if nothing
      extraordinary had happened, or was about to happen, to disturb our good
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hackney-coaches and carriages keep rattling up the street and down the
      street in rapid succession, conveying, doubtless, smartly-dressed
      coachfuls to crowded parties; loud and repeated double knocks at the house
      with green blinds, opposite, announce to the whole neighbourhood that
      there's one large party in the street at all events; and we saw through
      the window, and through the fog too, till it grew so thick that we rung
      for candles, and drew our curtains, pastry-cooks' men with green boxes on
      their heads, and rout-furniture-warehouse-carts, with cane seats and
      French lamps, hurrying to the numerous houses where an annual festival is
      held in honour of the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can fancy one of these parties, we think, as well as if we were duly
      dress-coated and pumped, and had just been announced at the drawing-room
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the house with the green blinds for instance. We know it is a
      quadrille party, because we saw some men taking up the front drawing- room
      carpet while we sat at breakfast this morning, and if further evidence be
      required, and we must tell the truth, we just now saw one of the young
      ladies 'doing' another of the young ladies' hair, near one of the bedroom
      windows, in an unusual style of splendour, which nothing else but a
      quadrille party could possibly justify.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the house with the green blinds is in a public office; we
      know the fact by the cut of his coat, the tie of his neckcloth, and the
      self-satisfaction of his gait-the very green blinds themselves have a
      Somerset House air about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hark!-a cab! That's a junior clerk in the same office; a tidy sort of
      young man, with a tendency to cold and corns, who comes in a pair of boots
      with black cloth fronts, and brings his shoes in his coat-pocket, which
      shoes he is at this very moment putting on in the hall. Now he is
      announced by the man in the passage to another man in a blue coat, who is
      a disguised messenger from the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the first landing precedes him to the drawing-room door. 'Mr.
      Tupple!' shouts the messenger. 'How are you, Tupple?' says the master of
      the house, advancing from the fire, before which he has been talking
      politics and airing himself. 'My dear, this is Mr. Tupple (a courteous
      salute from the lady of the house); Tupple, my eldest daughter; Julia, my
      dear, Mr. Tupple; Tupple, my other daughters; my son, sir;' Tupple rubs
      his hands very hard, and smiles as if it were all capital fun, and keeps
      constantly bowing and turning himself round, till the whole family have
      been introduced, when he glides into a chair at the corner of the sofa,
      and opens a miscellaneous conversation with the young ladies upon the
      weather, and the theatres, and the old year, and the last new murder, and
      the balloon, and the ladies' sleeves, and the festivities of the season,
      and a great many other topics of small talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      More double knocks! what an extensive party! what an incessant hum of
      conversation and general sipping of coffee! We see Tupple now, in our
      mind's eye, in the height of his glory. He has just handed that stout old
      lady's cup to the servant; and now, he dives among the crowd of young men
      by the door, to intercept the other servant, and secure the muffin-plate
      for the old lady's daughter, before he leaves the room; and now, as he
      passes the sofa on his way back, he bestows a glance of recognition and
      patronage upon the young ladies as condescending and familiar as if he had
      known them from infancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charming person Mr. Tupple-perfect ladies' man-such a delightful
      companion, too! Laugh!-nobody ever understood papa's jokes half so well as
      Mr. Tupple, who laughs himself into convulsions at every fresh burst of
      facetiousness. Most delightful partner! talks through the whole set! and
      although he does seem at first rather gay and frivolous, so romantic and
      with so much feeling! Quite a love. No great favourite with the young men,
      certainly, who sneer at, and affect to despise him; but everybody knows
      that's only envy, and they needn't give themselves the trouble to
      depreciate his merits at any rate, for Ma says he shall be asked to every
      future dinner-party, if it's only to talk to people between the courses,
      and distract their attention when there's any unexpected delay in the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper, Mr. Tupple shows to still greater advantage than he has done
      throughout the evening, and when Pa requests every one to fill their
      glasses for the purpose of drinking happiness throughout the year, Mr.
      Tupple is so droll: insisting on all the young ladies having their glasses
      filled, notwithstanding their repeated assurances that they never can, by
      any possibility, think of emptying them and subsequently begging
      permission to say a few words on the sentiment which has just been uttered
      by Pa-when he makes one of the most brilliant and poetical speeches that
      can possibly be imagined, about the old year and the new one. After the
      toast has been drunk, and when the ladies have retired, Mr. Tupple
      requests that every gentleman will do him the favour of filling his glass,
      for he has a toast to propose: on which all the gentlemen cry 'Hear!
      hear!' and pass the decanters accordingly: and Mr. Tupple being informed
      by the master of the house that they are all charged, and waiting for his
      toast, rises, and begs to remind the gentlemen present, how much they have
      been delighted by the dazzling array of elegance and beauty which the
      drawing-room has exhibited that night, and how their senses have been
      charmed, and their hearts captivated, by the bewitching concentration of
      female loveliness which that very room has so recently displayed. (Loud
      cries of 'Hear!') Much as he (Tupple) would be disposed to deplore the
      absence of the ladies, on other grounds, he cannot but derive some
      consolation from the reflection that the very circumstance of their not
      being present, enables him to propose a toast, which he would have
      otherwise been prevented from giving-that toast he begs to say is-'The
      Ladies!' (Great applause.) The Ladies! among whom the fascinating
      daughters of their excellent host, are alike conspicuous for their beauty,
      their accomplishments, and their elegance. He begs them to drain a bumper
      to 'The Ladies, and a happy new year to them!' (Prolonged approbation;
      above which the noise of the ladies dancing the Spanish dance among
      themselves, overhead, is distinctly audible.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The applause consequent on this toast, has scarcely subsided, when a young
      gentleman in a pink under-waistcoat, sitting towards the bottom of the
      table, is observed to grow very restless and fidgety, and to evince strong
      indications of some latent desire to give vent to his feelings in a
      speech, which the wary Tupple at once perceiving, determines to forestall
      by speaking himself. He, therefore, rises again, with an air of solemn
      importance, and trusts he may be permitted to propose another toast
      (unqualified approbation, and Mr. Tupple proceeds). He is sure they must
      all be deeply impressed with the hospitality-he may say the splendour-with
      which they have been that night received by their worthy host and hostess.
      (Unbounded applause.) Although this is the first occasion on which he has
      had the pleasure and delight of sitting at that board, he has known his
      friend Dobble long and intimately; he has been connected with him in
      business-he wishes everybody present knew Dobble as well as he does. (A
      cough from the host.) He (Tupple) can lay his hand upon his (Tupple's)
      heart, and declare his confident belief that a better man, a better
      husband, a better father, a better brother, a better son, a better
      relation in any relation of life, than Dobble, never existed. (Loud cries
      of 'Hear!') They have seen him to-night in the peaceful bosom of his
      family; they should see him in the morning, in the trying duties of his
      office. Calm in the perusal of the morning papers, uncompromising in the
      signature of his name, dignified in his replies to the inquiries of
      stranger applicants, deferential in his behaviour to his superiors,
      majestic in his deportment to the messengers. (Cheers.) When he bears this
      merited testimony to the excellent qualities of his friend Dobble, what
      can he say in approaching such a subject as Mrs. Dobble? Is it requisite
      for him to expatiate on the qualities of that amiable woman? No; he will
      spare his friend Dobble's feelings; he will spare the feelings of his
      friend-if he will allow him to have the honour of calling him so-Mr.
      Dobble, junior. (Here Mr. Dobble, junior, who has been previously
      distending his mouth to a considerable width, by thrusting a particularly
      fine orange into that feature, suspends operations, and assumes a proper
      appearance of intense melancholy). He will simply say-and he is quite
      certain it is a sentiment in which all who hear him will readily
      concur-that his friend Dobble is as superior to any man he ever knew, as
      Mrs. Dobble is far beyond any woman he ever saw (except her daughters);
      and he will conclude by proposing their worthy 'Host and Hostess, and may
      they live to enjoy many more new years!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The toast is drunk with acclamation; Dobble returns thanks, and the whole
      party rejoin the ladies in the drawing-room. Young men who were too
      bashful to dance before supper, find tongues and partners; the musicians
      exhibit unequivocal symptoms of having drunk the new year in, while the
      company were out; and dancing is kept up, until far in the first morning
      of the new year.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have scarcely written the last word of the previous sentence, when the
      first stroke of twelve, peals from the neighbouring churches. There
      certainly-we must confess it now-is something awful in the sound. Strictly
      speaking, it may not be more impressive now, than at any other time; for
      the hours steal as swiftly on, at other periods, and their flight is
      little heeded. But, we measure man's life by years, and it is a solemn
      knell that warns us we have passed another of the landmarks which stands
      between us and the grave. Disguise it as we may, the reflection will force
      itself on our minds, that when the next bell announces the arrival of a
      new year, we may be insensible alike of the timely warning we have so
      often neglected, and of all the warm feelings that glow within us now.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV-MISS EVANS AND THE EAGLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Samuel Wilkins was a carpenter, a journeyman carpenter of small
      dimensions, decidedly below the middle size-bordering, perhaps, upon the
      dwarfish. His face was round and shining, and his hair carefully twisted
      into the outer corner of each eye, till it formed a variety of that
      description of semi-curls, usually known as 'aggerawators.' His earnings
      were all-sufficient for his wants, varying from eighteen shillings to one
      pound five, weekly-his manner undeniable-his sabbath waistcoats dazzling.
      No wonder that, with these qualifications, Samuel Wilkins found favour in
      the eyes of the other sex: many women have been captivated by far less
      substantial qualifications. But, Samuel was proof against their
      blandishments, until at length his eyes rested on those of a Being for
      whom, from that time forth, he felt fate had destined him. He came, and
      conquered-proposed, and was accepted-loved, and was beloved. Mr. Wilkins
      'kept company' with Jemima Evans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Evans (or Ivins, to adopt the pronunciation most in vogue with her
      circle of acquaintance) had adopted in early life the useful pursuit of
      shoe-binding, to which she had afterwards superadded the occupation of a
      straw-bonnet maker. Herself, her maternal parent, and two sisters, formed
      an harmonious quartett in the most secluded portion of Camden- town; and
      here it was that Mr. Wilkins presented himself, one Monday afternoon, in
      his best attire, with his face more shining and his waistcoat more bright
      than either had ever appeared before. The family were just going to tea,
      and were so glad to see him. It was quite a little feast; two ounces of
      seven-and-sixpenny green, and a quarter of a pound of the best fresh; and
      Mr. Wilkins had brought a pint of shrimps, neatly folded up in a clean
      belcher, to give a zest to the meal, and propitiate Mrs. Ivins. Jemima was
      'cleaning herself' up-stairs; so Mr. Samuel Wilkins sat down and talked
      domestic economy with Mrs. Ivins, whilst the two youngest Miss Ivinses
      poked bits of lighted brown paper between the bars under the kettle, to
      make the water boil for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wos a thinking,' said Mr. Samuel Wilkins, during a pause in the
      conversation-'I wos a thinking of taking J'mima to the Eagle to-
      night.'-'O my!' exclaimed Mrs. Ivins. 'Lor! how nice!' said the youngest
      Miss Ivins. 'Well, I declare!' added the youngest Miss Ivins but one.
      'Tell J'mima to put on her white muslin, Tilly,' screamed Mrs. Ivins, with
      motherly anxiety; and down came J'mima herself soon afterwards in a white
      muslin gown carefully hooked and eyed, a little red shawl, plentifully
      pinned, a white straw bonnet trimmed with red ribbons, a small necklace, a
      large pair of bracelets, Denmark satin shoes, and open-worked stockings;
      white cotton gloves on her fingers, and a cambric pocket-handkerchief,
      carefully folded up, in her hand-all quite genteel and ladylike. And away
      went Miss J'mima Ivins and Mr. Samuel Wilkins, and a dress-cane, with a
      gilt knob at the top, to the admiration and envy of the street in general,
      and to the high gratification of Mrs. Ivins, and the two youngest Miss
      Ivinses in particular. They had no sooner turned into the Pancras-road,
      than who should Miss J'mima Ivins stumble upon, by the most fortunate
      accident in the world, but a young lady as she knew, with her young
      man!-And it is so strange how things do turn out sometimes-they were
      actually going to the Eagle too. So Mr. Samuel Wilkins was introduced to
      Miss J'mima Ivins's friend's young man, and they all walked on together,
      talking, and laughing, and joking away like anything; and when they got as
      far as Pentonville, Miss Ivins's friend's young man would have the ladies
      go into the Crown, to taste some shrub, which, after a great blushing and
      giggling, and hiding of faces in elaborate pocket-handkerchiefs, they
      consented to do. Having tasted it once, they were easily prevailed upon to
      taste it again; and they sat out in the garden tasting shrub, and looking
      at the Busses alternately, till it was just the proper time to go to the
      Eagle; and then they resumed their journey, and walked very fast, for fear
      they should lose the beginning of the concert in the Rotunda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How ev'nly!' said Miss J'mima Ivins, and Miss J'mima Ivins's friend, both
      at once, when they had passed the gate and were fairly inside the gardens.
      There were the walks, beautifully gravelled and planted-and the
      refreshment-boxes, painted and ornamented like so many snuff- boxes-and
      the variegated lamps shedding their rich light upon the company's
      heads-and the place for dancing ready chalked for the company's feet-and a
      Moorish band playing at one end of the gardens-and an opposition military
      band playing away at the other. Then, the waiters were rushing to and fro
      with glasses of negus, and glasses of brandy-and-water, and bottles of
      ale, and bottles of stout; and ginger- beer was going off in one place,
      and practical jokes were going on in another; and people were crowding to
      the door of the Rotunda; and in short the whole scene was, as Miss J'mima
      Ivins, inspired by the novelty, or the shrub, or both, observed-'one of
      dazzling excitement.' As to the concert-room, never was anything half so
      splendid. There was an orchestra for the singers, all paint, gilding, and
      plate-glass; and such an organ! Miss J'mima Ivins's friend's young man
      whispered it had cost 'four hundred pound,' which Mr. Samuel Wilkins said
      was 'not dear neither;' an opinion in which the ladies perfectly
      coincided. The audience were seated on elevated benches round the room,
      and crowded into every part of it; and everybody was eating and drinking
      as comfortably as possible. Just before the concert commenced, Mr. Samuel
      Wilkins ordered two glasses of rum-and-water 'warm with-' and two slices
      of lemon, for himself and the other young man, together with 'a pint o'
      sherry wine for the ladies, and some sweet carraway-seed biscuits;' and
      they would have been quite comfortable and happy, only a strange gentleman
      with large whiskers would stare at Miss J'mima Ivins, and another
      gentleman in a plaid waistcoat would wink at Miss J'mima Ivins's friend;
      on which Miss Jemima Ivins's friend's young man exhibited symptoms of
      boiling over, and began to mutter about 'people's imperence,' and 'swells
      out o' luck;' and to intimate, in oblique terms, a vague intention of
      knocking somebody's head off; which he was only prevented from announcing
      more emphatically, by both Miss J'mima Ivins and her friend threatening to
      faint away on the spot if he said another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concert commenced-overture on the organ. 'How solemn!' exclaimed Miss
      J'mima Ivins, glancing, perhaps unconsciously, at the gentleman with the
      whiskers. Mr. Samuel Wilkins, who had been muttering apart for some time
      past, as if he were holding a confidential conversation with the gilt knob
      of the dress-cane, breathed hard-breathing vengeance, perhaps,-but said
      nothing. 'The soldier tired,' Miss Somebody in white satin. 'Ancore!'
      cried Miss J'mima Ivins's friend. 'Ancore!' shouted the gentleman in the
      plaid waistcoat immediately, hammering the table with a stout-bottle. Miss
      J'mima Ivins's friend's young man eyed the man behind the waistcoat from
      head to foot, and cast a look of interrogative contempt towards Mr. Samuel
      Wilkins. Comic song, accompanied on the organ. Miss J'mima Ivins was
      convulsed with laughter-so was the man with the whiskers. Everything the
      ladies did, the plaid waistcoat and whiskers did, by way of expressing
      unity of sentiment and congeniality of soul; and Miss J'mima Ivins, and
      Miss J'mima Ivins's friend, grew lively and talkative, as Mr. Samuel
      Wilkins, and Miss J'mima Ivins's friend's young man, grew morose and surly
      in inverse proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if the matter had ended here, the little party might soon have
      recovered their former equanimity; but Mr. Samuel Wilkins and his friend
      began to throw looks of defiance upon the waistcoat and whiskers. And the
      waistcoat and whiskers, by way of intimating the slight degree in which
      they were affected by the looks aforesaid, bestowed glances of increased
      admiration upon Miss J'mima Ivins and friend. The concert and vaudeville
      concluded, they promenaded the gardens. The waistcoat and whiskers did the
      same; and made divers remarks complimentary to the ankles of Miss J'mima
      Ivins and friend, in an audible tone. At length, not satisfied with these
      numerous atrocities, they actually came up and asked Miss J'mima Ivins,
      and Miss J'mima Ivins's friend, to dance, without taking no more notice of
      Mr. Samuel Wilkins, and Miss J'mima Ivins's friend's young man, than if
      they was nobody!
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean by that, scoundrel!' exclaimed Mr. Samuel Wilkins,
      grasping the gilt-knobbed dress-cane firmly in his right hand. 'What's the
      matter with you, you little humbug?' replied the whiskers. 'How dare you
      insult me and my friend?' inquired the friend's young man. 'You and your
      friend be hanged!' responded the waistcoat. 'Take that,' exclaimed Mr.
      Samuel Wilkins. The ferrule of the gilt-knobbed dress- cane was visible
      for an instant, and then the light of the variegated lamps shone brightly
      upon it as it whirled into the air, cane and all. 'Give it him,' said the
      waistcoat. 'Horficer!' screamed the ladies. Miss J'mima Ivins's beau, and
      the friend's young man, lay gasping on the gravel, and the waistcoat and
      whiskers were seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss J'mima Ivins and friend being conscious that the affray was in no
      slight degree attributable to themselves, of course went into hysterics
      forthwith; declared themselves the most injured of women; exclaimed, in
      incoherent ravings, that they had been suspected-wrongfully suspected-oh!
      that they should ever have lived to see the day-and so forth; suffered a
      relapse every time they opened their eyes and saw their unfortunate little
      admirers; and were carried to their respective abodes in a hackney-coach,
      and a state of insensibility, compounded of shrub, sherry, and excitement.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V-THE PARLOUR ORATOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      We had been lounging one evening, down Oxford-street, Holborn, Cheapside,
      Coleman-street, Finsbury-square, and so on, with the intention of
      returning westward, by Pentonville and the New-road, when we began to feel
      rather thirsty, and disposed to rest for five or ten minutes. So, we
      turned back towards an old, quiet, decent public-house, which we
      remembered to have passed but a moment before (it was not far from the
      City-road), for the purpose of solacing ourself with a glass of ale. The
      house was none of your stuccoed, French-polished, illuminated palaces, but
      a modest public-house of the old school, with a little old bar, and a
      little old landlord, who, with a wife and daughter of the same pattern,
      was comfortably seated in the bar aforesaid-a snug little room with a
      cheerful fire, protected by a large screen: from behind which the young
      lady emerged on our representing our inclination for a glass of ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you walk into the parlour, sir?' said the young lady, in seductive
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had better walk into the parlour, sir,' said the little old landlord,
      throwing his chair back, and looking round one side of the screen, to
      survey our appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had much better step into the parlour, sir,' said the little old
      lady, popping out her head, on the other side of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cast a slight glance around, as if to express our ignorance of the
      locality so much recommended. The little old landlord observed it; bustled
      out of the small door of the small bar; and forthwith ushered us into the
      parlour itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an ancient, dark-looking room, with oaken wainscoting, a sanded
      floor, and a high mantel-piece. The walls were ornamented with three or
      four old coloured prints in black frames, each print representing a naval
      engagement, with a couple of men-of-war banging away at each other most
      vigorously, while another vessel or two were blowing up in the distance,
      and the foreground presented a miscellaneous collection of broken masts
      and blue legs sticking up out of the water. Depending from the ceiling in
      the centre of the room, were a gas-light and bell-pull; on each side were
      three or four long narrow tables, behind which was a thickly-planted row
      of those slippery, shiny-looking wooden chairs, peculiar to hostelries of
      this description. The monotonous appearance of the sanded boards was
      relieved by an occasional spittoon; and a triangular pile of those useful
      articles adorned the two upper corners of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the furthest table, nearest the fire, with his face towards the door at
      the bottom of the room, sat a stoutish man of about forty, whose short,
      stiff, black hair curled closely round a broad high forehead, and a face
      to which something besides water and exercise had communicated a rather
      inflamed appearance. He was smoking a cigar, with his eyes fixed on the
      ceiling, and had that confident oracular air which marked him as the
      leading politician, general authority, and universal anecdote- relater, of
      the place. He had evidently just delivered himself of something very
      weighty; for the remainder of the company were puffing at their respective
      pipes and cigars in a kind of solemn abstraction, as if quite overwhelmed
      with the magnitude of the subject recently under discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his right hand sat an elderly gentleman with a white head, and broad-
      brimmed brown hat; on his left, a sharp-nosed, light-haired man in a brown
      surtout reaching nearly to his heels, who took a whiff at his pipe, and an
      admiring glance at the red-faced man, alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very extraordinary!' said the light-haired man after a pause of five
      minutes. A murmur of assent ran through the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all extraordinary-not at all,' said the red-faced man, awakening
      suddenly from his reverie, and turning upon the light-haired man, the
      moment he had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should it be extraordinary?-why is it extraordinary?-prove it to be
      extraordinary!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, if you come to that-' said the light-haired man, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come to that!' ejaculated the man with the red face; 'but we must come to
      that. We stand, in these times, upon a calm elevation of intellectual
      attainment, and not in the dark recess of mental deprivation. Proof, is
      what I require-proof, and not assertions, in these stirring times. Every
      gen'lem'n that knows me, knows what was the nature and effect of my
      observations, when it was in the contemplation of the Old-street Suburban
      Representative Discovery Society, to recommend a candidate for that place
      in Cornwall there-I forget the name of it. "Mr. Snobee," said Mr. Wilson,
      "is a fit and proper person to represent the borough in Parliament."
      "Prove it," says I. "He is a friend to Reform," says Mr. Wilson. "Prove
      it," says I. "The abolitionist of the national debt, the unflinching
      opponent of pensions, the uncompromising advocate of the negro, the
      reducer of sinecures and the duration of Parliaments; the extender of
      nothing but the suffrages of the people," says Mr. Wilson. "Prove it,"
      says I. "His acts prove it," says he. "Prove them," says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he could not prove them,' said the red-faced man, looking round
      triumphantly; 'and the borough didn't have him; and if you carried this
      principle to the full extent, you'd have no debt, no pensions, no
      sinecures, no negroes, no nothing. And then, standing upon an elevation of
      intellectual attainment, and having reached the summit of popular
      prosperity, you might bid defiance to the nations of the earth, and erect
      yourselves in the proud confidence of wisdom and superiority. This is my
      argument-this always has been my argument-and if I was a Member of the
      House of Commons to-morrow, I'd make 'em shake in their shoes with it. And
      the red-faced man, having struck the table very hard with his clenched
      fist, to add weight to the declaration, smoked away like a brewery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well!' said the sharp-nosed man, in a very slow and soft voice,
      addressing the company in general, 'I always do say, that of all the
      gentlemen I have the pleasure of meeting in this room, there is not one
      whose conversation I like to hear so much as Mr. Rogers's, or who is such
      improving company.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Improving company!' said Mr. Rogers, for that, it seemed, was the name of
      the red-faced man. 'You may say I am improving company, for I've improved
      you all to some purpose; though as to my conversation being as my friend
      Mr. Ellis here describes it, that is not for me to say anything about.
      You, gentlemen, are the best judges on that point; but this I will say,
      when I came into this parish, and first used this room, ten years ago, I
      don't believe there was one man in it, who knew he was a slave-and now you
      all know it, and writhe under it. Inscribe that upon my tomb, and I am
      satisfied.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, as to inscribing it on your tomb,' said a little greengrocer with a
      chubby face, 'of course you can have anything chalked up, as you likes to
      pay for, so far as it relates to yourself and your affairs; but, when you
      come to talk about slaves, and that there abuse, you'd better keep it in
      the family, 'cos I for one don't like to be called them names, night after
      night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are a slave,' said the red-faced man, 'and the most pitiable of all
      slaves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Werry hard if I am,' interrupted the greengrocer, 'for I got no good out
      of the twenty million that was paid for 'mancipation, anyhow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A willing slave,' ejaculated the red-faced man, getting more red with
      eloquence, and contradiction-'resigning the dearest birthright of your
      children-neglecting the sacred call of Liberty-who, standing imploringly
      before you, appeals to the warmest feelings of your heart, and points to
      your helpless infants, but in vain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Prove it,' said the greengrocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Prove it!' sneered the man with the red face. 'What! bending beneath the
      yoke of an insolent and factious oligarchy; bowed down by the domination
      of cruel laws; groaning beneath tyranny and oppression on every hand, at
      every side, and in every corner. Prove it!-' The red- faced man abruptly
      broke off, sneered melo-dramatically, and buried his countenance and his
      indignation together, in a quart pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, to be sure, Mr. Rogers,' said a stout broker in a large waistcoat,
      who had kept his eyes fixed on this luminary all the time he was speaking.
      'Ah, to be sure,' said the broker with a sigh, 'that's the point.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, of course,' said divers members of the company, who understood
      almost as much about the matter as the broker himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had better let him alone, Tommy,' said the broker, by way of advice
      to the little greengrocer; 'he can tell what's o'clock by an eight-day,
      without looking at the minute hand, he can. Try it on, on some other suit;
      it won't do with him, Tommy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is a man?' continued the red-faced specimen of the species, jerking
      his hat indignantly from its peg on the wall. 'What is an Englishman? Is
      he to be trampled upon by every oppressor? Is he to be knocked down at
      everybody's bidding? What's freedom? Not a standing army. What's a
      standing army? Not freedom. What's general happiness? Not universal
      misery. Liberty ain't the window-tax, is it? The Lords ain't the Commons,
      are they?' And the red-faced man, gradually bursting into a radiating
      sentence, in which such adjectives as 'dastardly,' 'oppressive,'
      'violent,' and 'sanguinary,' formed the most conspicuous words, knocked
      his hat indignantly over his eyes, left the room, and slammed the door
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wonderful man!' said he of the sharp nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Splendid speaker!' added the broker.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great power!' said everybody but the greengrocer. And as they said it,
      the whole party shook their heads mysteriously, and one by one retired,
      leaving us alone in the old parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we had followed the established precedent in all such instances, we
      should have fallen into a fit of musing, without delay. The ancient
      appearance of the room-the old panelling of the wall-the chimney blackened
      with smoke and age-would have carried us back a hundred years at least,
      and we should have gone dreaming on, until the pewter-pot on the table, or
      the little beer-chiller on the fire, had started into life, and addressed
      to us a long story of days gone by. But, by some means or other, we were
      not in a romantic humour; and although we tried very hard to invest the
      furniture with vitality, it remained perfectly unmoved, obstinate, and
      sullen. Being thus reduced to the unpleasant necessity of musing about
      ordinary matters, our thoughts reverted to the red-faced man, and his
      oratorical display.
    </p>
    <p>
      A numerous race are these red-faced men; there is not a parlour, or
      club-room, or benefit society, or humble party of any kind, without its
      red-faced man. Weak-pated dolts they are, and a great deal of mischief
      they do to their cause, however good. So, just to hold a pattern one up,
      to know the others by, we took his likeness at once, and put him in here.
      And that is the reason why we have written this paper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI-THE HOSPITAL PATIENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      In our rambles through the streets of London after evening has set in, we
      often pause beneath the windows of some public hospital, and picture to
      ourself the gloomy and mournful scenes that are passing within. The sudden
      moving of a taper as its feeble ray shoots from window to window, until
      its light gradually disappears, as if it were carried farther back into
      the room to the bedside of some suffering patient, is enough to awaken a
      whole crowd of reflections; the mere glimmering of the low- burning lamps,
      which, when all other habitations are wrapped in darkness and slumber,
      denote the chamber where so many forms are writhing with pain, or wasting
      with disease, is sufficient to check the most boisterous merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can tell the anguish of those weary hours, when the only sound the
      sick man hears, is the disjointed wanderings of some feverish slumberer
      near him, the low moan of pain, or perhaps the muttered, long-forgotten
      prayer of a dying man? Who, but they who have felt it, can imagine the
      sense of loneliness and desolation which must be the portion of those who
      in the hour of dangerous illness are left to be tended by strangers; for
      what hands, be they ever so gentle, can wipe the clammy brow, or smooth
      the restless bed, like those of mother, wife, or child?
    </p>
    <p>
      Impressed with these thoughts, we have turned away, through the nearly-
      deserted streets; and the sight of the few miserable creatures still
      hovering about them, has not tended to lessen the pain which such
      meditations awaken. The hospital is a refuge and resting-place for
      hundreds, who but for such institutions must die in the streets and
      doorways; but what can be the feelings of some outcasts when they are
      stretched on the bed of sickness with scarcely a hope of recovery? The
      wretched woman who lingers about the pavement, hours after midnight, and
      the miserable shadow of a man-the ghastly remnant that want and
      drunkenness have left-which crouches beneath a window-ledge, to sleep
      where there is some shelter from the rain, have little to bind them to
      life, but what have they to look back upon, in death? What are the
      unwonted comforts of a roof and a bed, to them, when the recollections of
      a whole life of debasement stalk before them; when repentance seems a
      mockery, and sorrow comes too late?
    </p>
    <p>
      About a twelvemonth ago, as we were strolling through Covent-garden (we
      had been thinking about these things over-night), we were attracted by the
      very prepossessing appearance of a pickpocket, who having declined to take
      the trouble of walking to the Police-office, on the ground that he hadn't
      the slightest wish to go there at all, was being conveyed thither in a
      wheelbarrow, to the huge delight of a crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, we never can resist joining a crowd, so we turned back with the
      mob, and entered the office, in company with our friend the pickpocket, a
      couple of policemen, and as many dirty-faced spectators as could squeeze
      their way in.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a powerful, ill-looking young fellow at the bar, who was
      undergoing an examination, on the very common charge of having, on the
      previous night, ill-treated a woman, with whom he lived in some court hard
      by. Several witnesses bore testimony to acts of the grossest brutality;
      and a certificate was read from the house-surgeon of a neighbouring
      hospital, describing the nature of the injuries the woman had received,
      and intimating that her recovery was extremely doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some question appeared to have been raised about the identity of the
      prisoner; for when it was agreed that the two magistrates should visit the
      hospital at eight o'clock that evening, to take her deposition, it was
      settled that the man should be taken there also. He turned pale at this,
      and we saw him clench the bar very hard when the order was given. He was
      removed directly afterwards, and he spoke not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      We felt an irrepressible curiosity to witness this interview, although it
      is hard to tell why, at this instant, for we knew it must be a painful
      one. It was no very difficult matter for us to gain permission, and we
      obtained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner, and the officer who had him in custody, were already at the
      hospital when we reached it, and waiting the arrival of the magistrates in
      a small room below stairs. The man was handcuffed, and his hat was pulled
      forward over his eyes. It was easy to see, though, by the whiteness of his
      countenance, and the constant twitching of the muscles of his face, that
      he dreaded what was to come. After a short interval, the magistrates and
      clerk were bowed in by the house-surgeon and a couple of young men who
      smelt very strong of tobacco-smoke-they were introduced as 'dressers'-and
      after one magistrate had complained bitterly of the cold, and the other of
      the absence of any news in the evening paper, it was announced that the
      patient was prepared; and we were conducted to the 'casualty ward' in
      which she was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dim light which burnt in the spacious room, increased rather than
      diminished the ghastly appearance of the hapless creatures in the beds,
      which were ranged in two long rows on either side. In one bed, lay a child
      enveloped in bandages, with its body half-consumed by fire; in another, a
      female, rendered hideous by some dreadful accident, was wildly beating her
      clenched fists on the coverlet, in pain; on a third, there lay stretched a
      young girl, apparently in the heavy stupor often the immediate precursor
      of death: her face was stained with blood, and her breast and arms were
      bound up in folds of linen. Two or three of the beds were empty, and their
      recent occupants were sitting beside them, but with faces so wan, and eyes
      so bright and glassy, that it was fearful to meet their gaze. On every
      face was stamped the expression of anguish and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of the visit was lying at the upper end of the room. She was a
      fine young woman of about two or three and twenty. Her long black hair,
      which had been hastily cut from near the wounds on her head, streamed over
      the pillow in jagged and matted locks. Her face bore deep marks of the
      ill-usage she had received: her hand was pressed upon her side, as if her
      chief pain were there; her breathing was short and heavy; and it was plain
      to see that she was dying fast. She murmured a few words in reply to the
      magistrate's inquiry whether she was in great pain; and, having been
      raised on the pillow by the nurse, looked vacantly upon the strange
      countenances that surrounded her bed. The magistrate nodded to the
      officer, to bring the man forward. He did so, and stationed him at the
      bedside. The girl looked on with a wild and troubled expression of face;
      but her sight was dim, and she did not know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take off his hat,' said the magistrate. The officer did as he was
      desired, and the man's features were disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl started up, with an energy quite preternatural; the fire gleamed
      in her heavy eyes, and the blood rushed to her pale and sunken cheeks. It
      was a convulsive effort. She fell back upon her pillow, and covering her
      scarred and bruised face with her hands, burst into tears. The man cast an
      anxious look towards her, but otherwise appeared wholly unmoved. After a
      brief pause the nature of the errand was explained, and the oath tendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, gentlemen,' said the girl, raising herself once more, and folding
      her hands together; 'no, gentlemen, for God's sake! I did it myself-it was
      nobody's fault-it was an accident. He didn't hurt me; he wouldn't for all
      the world. Jack, dear Jack, you know you wouldn't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sight was fast failing her, and her hand groped over the bedclothes in
      search of his. Brute as the man was, he was not prepared for this. He
      turned his face from the bed, and sobbed. The girl's colour changed, and
      her breathing grew more difficult. She was evidently dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We respect the feelings which prompt you to this,' said the gentleman who
      had spoken first, 'but let me warn you, not to persist in what you know to
      be untrue, until it is too late. It cannot save him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jack,' murmured the girl, laying her hand upon his arm, 'they shall not
      persuade me to swear your life away. He didn't do it, gentlemen. He never
      hurt me.' She grasped his arm tightly, and added, in a broken whisper, 'I
      hope God Almighty will forgive me all the wrong I have done, and the life
      I have led. God bless you, Jack. Some kind gentleman take my love to my
      poor old father. Five years ago, he said he wished I had died a child. Oh,
      I wish I had! I wish I had!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse bent over the girl for a few seconds, and then drew the sheet
      over her face. It covered a corpse.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII-THE MISPLACED ATTACHMENT OF MR. JOHN DOUNCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      If we had to make a classification of society, there is a particular kind
      of men whom we should immediately set down under the head of 'Old Boys;'
      and a column of most extensive dimensions the old boys would require. To
      what precise causes the rapid advance of old-boy population is to be
      traced, we are unable to determine. It would be an interesting and curious
      speculation, but, as we have not sufficient space to devote to it here, we
      simply state the fact that the numbers of the old boys have been gradually
      augmenting within the last few years, and that they are at this moment
      alarmingly on the increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a general review of the subject, and without considering it minutely
      in detail, we should be disposed to subdivide the old boys into two
      distinct classes-the gay old boys, and the steady old boys. The gay old
      boys, are paunchy old men in the disguise of young ones, who frequent the
      Quadrant and Regent-street in the day-time: the theatres (especially
      theatres under lady management) at night; and who assume all the
      foppishness and levity of boys, without the excuse of youth or
      inexperience. The steady old boys are certain stout old gentlemen of clean
      appearance, who are always to be seen in the same taverns, at the same
      hours every evening, smoking and drinking in the same company.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was once a fine collection of old boys to be seen round the circular
      table at Offley's every night, between the hours of half-past eight and
      half-past eleven. We have lost sight of them for some time. There were,
      and may be still, for aught we know, two splendid specimens in full
      blossom at the Rainbow Tavern in Fleet-street, who always used to sit in
      the box nearest the fireplace, and smoked long cherry-stick pipes which
      went under the table, with the bowls resting on the floor. Grand old boys
      they were-fat, red-faced, white-headed old fellows-always there-one on one
      side the table, and the other opposite-puffing and drinking away in great
      state. Everybody knew them, and it was supposed by some people that they
      were both immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Dounce was an old boy of the latter class (we don't mean
      immortal, but steady), a retired glove and braces maker, a widower,
      resident with three daughters-all grown up, and all unmarried-in
      Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. He was a short, round, large-faced,
      tubbish sort of man, with a broad-brimmed hat, and a square coat; and had
      that grave, but confident, kind of roll, peculiar to old boys in general.
      Regular as clockwork-breakfast at nine-dress and tittivate a little-down
      to the Sir Somebody's Head-a glass of ale and the paper-come back again,
      and take daughters out for a walk-dinner at three-glass of grog and
      pipe-nap-tea-little walk-Sir Somebody's Head again-capital
      house-delightful evenings. There were Mr. Harris, the law-stationer, and
      Mr. Jennings, the robe-maker (two jolly young fellows like himself), and
      Jones, the barrister's clerk-rum fellow that Jones-capital company-full of
      anecdote!-and there they sat every night till just ten minutes before
      twelve, drinking their brandy-and-water, and smoking their pipes, and
      telling stories, and enjoying themselves with a kind of solemn joviality
      particularly edifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Jones would propose a half-price visit to Drury Lane or Covent
      Garden, to see two acts of a five-act play, and a new farce, perhaps, or a
      ballet, on which occasions the whole four of them went together: none of
      your hurrying and nonsense, but having their brandy-and-water first,
      comfortably, and ordering a steak and some oysters for their supper
      against they came back, and then walking coolly into the pit, when the
      'rush' had gone in, as all sensible people do, and did when Mr. Dounce was
      a young man, except when the celebrated Master Betty was at the height of
      his popularity, and then, sir,-then-Mr. Dounce perfectly well remembered
      getting a holiday from business; and going to the pit doors at eleven
      o'clock in the forenoon, and waiting there, till six in the afternoon,
      with some sandwiches in a pocket-handkerchief and some wine in a phial;
      and fainting after all, with the heat and fatigue, before the play began;
      in which situation he was lifted out of the pit, into one of the dress
      boxes, sir, by five of the finest women of that day, sir, who
      compassionated his situation and administered restoratives, and sent a
      black servant, six foot high, in blue and silver livery, next morning with
      their compliments, and to know how he found himself, sir-by G-! Between
      the acts Mr. Dounce and Mr. Harris, and Mr. Jennings, used to stand up,
      and look round the house, and Jones-knowing fellow that Jones-knew
      everybody-pointed out the fashionable and celebrated Lady So- and-So in
      the boxes, at the mention of whose name Mr. Dounce, after brushing up his
      hair, and adjusting his neckerchief, would inspect the aforesaid Lady
      So-and-So through an immense glass, and remark, either, that she was a
      'fine woman-very fine woman, indeed,' or that 'there might be a little
      more of her, eh, Jones?' Just as the case might happen to be. When the
      dancing began, John Dounce and the other old boys were particularly
      anxious to see what was going forward on the stage, and Jones-wicked dog
      that Jones-whispered little critical remarks into the ears of John Dounce,
      which John Dounce retailed to Mr. Harris and Mr. Harris to Mr. Jennings;
      and then they all four laughed, until the tears ran down out of their
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the curtain fell, they walked back together, two and two, to the
      steaks and oysters; and when they came to the second glass of brandy-
      and-water, Jones-hoaxing scamp, that Jones-used to recount how he had
      observed a lady in white feathers, in one of the pit boxes, gazing
      intently on Mr. Dounce all the evening, and how he had caught Mr. Dounce,
      whenever he thought no one was looking at him, bestowing ardent looks of
      intense devotion on the lady in return; on which Mr. Harris and Mr.
      Jennings used to laugh very heartily, and John Dounce more heartily than
      either of them, acknowledging, however, that the time had been when he
      might have done such things; upon which Mr. Jones used to poke him in the
      ribs, and tell him he had been a sad dog in his time, which John Dounce
      with chuckles confessed. And after Mr. Harris and Mr. Jennings had
      preferred their claims to the character of having been sad dogs too, they
      separated harmoniously, and trotted home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decrees of Fate, and the means by which they are brought about, are
      mysterious and inscrutable. John Dounce had led this life for twenty years
      and upwards, without wish for change, or care for variety, when his whole
      social system was suddenly upset and turned completely topsy- turvy-not by
      an earthquake, or some other dreadful convulsion of nature, as the reader
      would be inclined to suppose, but by the simple agency of an oyster; and
      thus it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Dounce was returning one night from the Sir Somebody's Head, to
      his residence in Cursitor-street-not tipsy, but rather excited, for it was
      Mr. Jennings's birthday, and they had had a brace of partridges for
      supper, and a brace of extra glasses afterwards, and Jones had been more
      than ordinarily amusing-when his eyes rested on a newly-opened oyster-
      shop, on a magnificent scale, with natives laid, one deep, in circular
      marble basins in the windows, together with little round barrels of
      oysters directed to Lords and Baronets, and Colonels and Captains, in
      every part of the habitable globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the natives were the barrels, and behind the barrels was a young
      lady of about five-and-twenty, all in blue, and all alone-splendid
      creature, charming face and lovely figure! It is difficult to say whether
      Mr. John Dounce's red countenance, illuminated as it was by the flickering
      gas-light in the window before which he paused, excited the lady's
      risibility, or whether a natural exuberance of animal spirits proved too
      much for that staidness of demeanour which the forms of society rather
      dictatorially prescribe. But certain it is, that the lady smiled; then put
      her finger upon her lip, with a striking recollection of what was due to
      herself; and finally retired, in oyster- like bashfulness, to the very
      back of the counter. The sad-dog sort of feeling came strongly upon John
      Dounce: he lingered-the lady in blue made no sign. He coughed-still she
      came not. He entered the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you open me an oyster, my dear?' said Mr. John Dounce.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dare say I can, sir,' replied the lady in blue, with playfulness. And Mr.
      John Dounce eat one oyster, and then looked at the young lady, and then
      eat another, and then squeezed the young lady's hand as she was opening
      the third, and so forth, until he had devoured a dozen of those at
      eightpence in less than no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you open me half-a-dozen more, my dear?' inquired Mr. John Dounce.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll see what I can do for you, sir,' replied the young lady in blue,
      even more bewitchingly than before; and Mr. John Dounce eat half-a-dozen
      more of those at eightpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You couldn't manage to get me a glass of brandy-and-water, my dear, I
      suppose?' said Mr. John Dounce, when he had finished the oysters: in a
      tone which clearly implied his supposition that she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll see, sir,' said the young lady: and away she ran out of the shop,
      and down the street, her long auburn ringlets shaking in the wind in the
      most enchanting manner; and back she came again, tripping over the coal-
      cellar lids like a whipping-top, with a tumbler of brandy-and-water, which
      Mr. John Dounce insisted on her taking a share of, as it was regular
      ladies' grog-hot, strong, sweet, and plenty of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the young lady sat down with Mr. John Dounce, in a little red box with
      a green curtain, and took a small sip of the brandy-and-water, and a small
      look at Mr. John Dounce, and then turned her head away, and went through
      various other serio-pantomimic fascinations, which forcibly reminded Mr.
      John Dounce of the first time he courted his first wife, and which made
      him feel more affectionate than ever; in pursuance of which affection, and
      actuated by which feeling, Mr. John Dounce sounded the young lady on her
      matrimonial engagements, when the young lady denied having formed any such
      engagements at all-she couldn't abear the men, they were such deceivers;
      thereupon Mr. John Dounce inquired whether this sweeping condemnation was
      meant to include other than very young men; on which the young lady
      blushed deeply-at least she turned away her head, and said Mr. John Dounce
      had made her blush, so of course she did blush-and Mr. John Dounce was a
      long time drinking the brandy- and-water; and, at last, John Dounce went
      home to bed, and dreamed of his first wife, and his second wife, and the
      young lady, and partridges, and oysters, and brandy-and-water, and
      disinterested attachments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, John Dounce was rather feverish with the extra brandy-
      and-water of the previous night; and, partly in the hope of cooling
      himself with an oyster, and partly with the view of ascertaining whether
      he owed the young lady anything, or not, went back to the oyster-shop. If
      the young lady had appeared beautiful by night, she was perfectly
      irresistible by day; and, from this time forward, a change came over the
      spirit of John Dounce's dream. He bought shirt-pins; wore a ring on his
      third finger; read poetry; bribed a cheap miniature-painter to perpetrate
      a faint resemblance to a youthful face, with a curtain over his head, six
      large books in the background, and an open country in the distance (this
      he called his portrait); 'went on' altogether in such an uproarious
      manner, that the three Miss Dounces went off on small pensions, he having
      made the tenement in Cursitor-street too warm to contain them; and in
      short, comported and demeaned himself in every respect like an unmitigated
      old Saracen, as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to his ancient friends, the other old boys, at the Sir Somebody's Head,
      he dropped off from them by gradual degrees; for, even when he did go
      there, Jones-vulgar fellow that Jones-persisted in asking 'when it was to
      be?' and 'whether he was to have any gloves?' together with other
      inquiries of an equally offensive nature: at which not only Harris
      laughed, but Jennings also; so, he cut the two, altogether, and attached
      himself solely to the blue young lady at the smart oyster-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now comes the moral of the story-for it has a moral after all. The
      last-mentioned young lady, having derived sufficient profit and emolument
      from John Dounce's attachment, not only refused, when matters came to a
      crisis, to take him for better for worse, but expressly declared, to use
      her own forcible words, that she 'wouldn't have him at no price;' and John
      Dounce, having lost his old friends, alienated his relations, and rendered
      himself ridiculous to everybody, made offers successively to a
      schoolmistress, a landlady, a feminine tobacconist, and a housekeeper;
      and, being directly rejected by each and every of them, was accepted by
      his cook, with whom he now lives, a henpecked husband, a melancholy
      monument of antiquated misery, and a living warning to all uxorious old
      boys.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII-THE MISTAKEN MILLINER. A TALE OF AMBITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Amelia Martin was pale, tallish, thin, and two-and-thirty-what ill-
      natured people would call plain, and police reports interesting. She was a
      milliner and dressmaker, living on her business and not above it. If you
      had been a young lady in service, and had wanted Miss Martin, as a great
      many young ladies in service did, you would just have stepped up, in the
      evening, to number forty-seven, Drummond-street, George- street,
      Euston-square, and after casting your eye on a brass door-plate, one foot
      ten by one and a half, ornamented with a great brass knob at each of the
      four corners, and bearing the inscription 'Miss Martin; millinery and
      dressmaking, in all its branches;' you'd just have knocked two loud knocks
      at the street-door; and down would have come Miss Martin herself, in a
      merino gown of the newest fashion, black velvet bracelets on the
      genteelest principle, and other little elegancies of the most approved
      description.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Miss Martin knew the young lady who called, or if the young lady who
      called had been recommended by any other young lady whom Miss Martin knew,
      Miss Martin would forthwith show her up-stairs into the two-pair front,
      and chat she would-so kind, and so comfortable-it really wasn't like a
      matter of business, she was so friendly; and, then Miss Martin, after
      contemplating the figure and general appearance of the young lady in
      service with great apparent admiration, would say how well she would look,
      to be sure, in a low dress with short sleeves; made very full in the
      skirts, with four tucks in the bottom; to which the young lady in service
      would reply in terms expressive of her entire concurrence in the notion,
      and of the virtuous indignation with which she reflected on the tyranny of
      'Missis,' who wouldn't allow a young girl to wear a short sleeve of an
      arternoon-no, nor nothing smart, not even a pair of ear- rings; let alone
      hiding people's heads of hair under them frightful caps. At the
      termination of this complaint, Miss Amelia Martin would distantly suggest
      certain dark suspicions that some people were jealous on account of their
      own daughters, and were obliged to keep their servants' charms under, for
      fear they should get married first, which was no uncommon
      circumstance-leastways she had known two or three young ladies in service,
      who had married a great deal better than their missises, and they were not
      very good-looking either; and then the young lady would inform Miss
      Martin, in confidence, that how one of their young ladies was engaged to a
      young man and was a-going to be married, and Missis was so proud about it
      there was no bearing of her; but how she needn't hold her head quite so
      high neither, for, after all, he was only a clerk. And, after expressing
      due contempt for clerks in general, and the engaged clerk in particular,
      and the highest opinion possible of themselves and each other, Miss Martin
      and the young lady in service would bid each other good night, in a
      friendly but perfectly genteel manner: and the one went back to her
      'place,' and the other, to her room on the second-floor front.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no saying how long Miss Amelia Martin might have continued this
      course of life; how extensive a connection she might have established
      among young ladies in service; or what amount her demands upon their
      quarterly receipts might have ultimately attained, had not an unforeseen
      train of circumstances directed her thoughts to a sphere of action very
      different from dressmaking or millinery.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend of Miss Martin's who had long been keeping company with an
      ornamental painter and decorator's journeyman, at last consented (on being
      at last asked to do so) to name the day which would make the aforesaid
      journeyman a happy husband. It was a Monday that was appointed for the
      celebration of the nuptials, and Miss Amelia Martin was invited, among
      others, to honour the wedding-dinner with her presence. It was a charming
      party; Somers-town the locality, and a front parlour the apartment. The
      ornamental painter and decorator's journeyman had taken a house-no
      lodgings nor vulgarity of that kind, but a house-four beautiful rooms, and
      a delightful little washhouse at the end of the passage-which was the most
      convenient thing in the world, for the bridesmaids could sit in the front
      parlour and receive the company, and then run into the little washhouse
      and see how the pudding and boiled pork were getting on in the copper, and
      then pop back into the parlour again, as snug and comfortable as possible.
      And such a parlour as it was! Beautiful Kidderminster carpet-six bran-new
      cane-bottomed stained chairs-three wine-glasses and a tumbler on each
      sideboard-farmer's girl and farmer's boy on the mantelpiece: girl tumbling
      over a stile, and boy spitting himself, on the handle of a pitchfork-long
      white dimity curtains in the window-and, in short, everything on the most
      genteel scale imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the dinner. There was baked leg of mutton at the top, boiled leg of
      mutton at the bottom, pair of fowls and leg of pork in the middle;
      porter-pots at the corners; pepper, mustard, and vinegar in the centre;
      vegetables on the floor; and plum-pudding and apple-pie and tartlets
      without number: to say nothing of cheese, and celery, and water-cresses,
      and all that sort of thing. As to the Company! Miss Amelia Martin herself
      declared, on a subsequent occasion, that, much as she had heard of the
      ornamental painter's journeyman's connexion, she never could have supposed
      it was half so genteel. There was his father, such a funny old
      gentleman-and his mother, such a dear old lady-and his sister, such a
      charming girl-and his brother, such a manly-looking young man-with such a
      eye! But even all these were as nothing when compared with his musical
      friends, Mr. and Mrs. Jennings Rodolph, from White Conduit, with whom the
      ornamental painter's journeyman had been fortunate enough to contract an
      intimacy while engaged in decorating the concert-room of that noble
      institution. To hear them sing separately, was divine, but when they went
      through the tragic duet of 'Red Ruffian, retire!' it was, as Miss Martin
      afterwards remarked, 'thrilling.' And why (as Mr. Jennings Rodolph
      observed) why were they not engaged at one of the patent theatres? If he
      was to be told that their voices were not powerful enough to fill the
      House, his only reply was, that he would back himself for any amount to
      fill Russell-square-a statement in which the company, after hearing the
      duet, expressed their full belief; so they all said it was shameful
      treatment; and both Mr. and Mrs. Jennings Rodolph said it was shameful
      too; and Mr. Jennings Rodolph looked very serious, and said he knew who
      his malignant opponents were, but they had better take care how far they
      went, for if they irritated him too much he had not quite made up his mind
      whether he wouldn't bring the subject before Parliament; and they all
      agreed that it ''ud serve 'em quite right, and it was very proper that
      such people should be made an example of.' So Mr. Jennings Rodolph said
      he'd think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the conversation resumed its former tone, Mr. Jennings Rodolph
      claimed his right to call upon a lady, and the right being conceded,
      trusted Miss Martin would favour the company-a proposal which met with
      unanimous approbation, whereupon Miss Martin, after sundry hesitatings and
      coughings, with a preparatory choke or two, and an introductory
      declaration that she was frightened to death to attempt it before such
      great judges of the art, commenced a species of treble chirruping
      containing frequent allusions to some young gentleman of the name of
      Hen-e-ry, with an occasional reference to madness and broken hearts. Mr.
      Jennings Rodolph frequently interrupted the progress of the song, by
      ejaculating 'Beautiful!'-'Charming!'-'Brilliant!'-'Oh! splendid,' &amp;c.;
      and at its close the admiration of himself, and his lady, knew no bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you ever hear so sweet a voice, my dear?' inquired Mr. Jennings
      Rodolph of Mrs. Jennings Rodolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never; indeed I never did, love,' replied Mrs. Jennings Rodolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you think Miss Martin, with a little cultivation, would be very
      like Signora Marra Boni, my dear?' asked Mr. Jennings Rodolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just exactly the very thing that struck me, my love,' answered Mrs.
      Jennings Rodolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus the time passed away; Mr. Jennings Rodolph played tunes on a
      walking-stick, and then went behind the parlour-door and gave his
      celebrated imitations of actors, edge-tools, and animals; Miss Martin sang
      several other songs with increased admiration every time; and even the
      funny old gentleman began singing. His song had properly seven verses, but
      as he couldn't recollect more than the first one, he sang that over seven
      times, apparently very much to his own personal gratification. And then
      all the company sang the national anthem with national independence-each
      for himself, without reference to the other-and finally separated: all
      declaring that they never had spent so pleasant an evening: and Miss
      Martin inwardly resolving to adopt the advice of Mr. Jennings Rodolph, and
      to 'come out' without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, 'coming out,' either in acting, or singing, or society, or
      facetiousness, or anything else, is all very well, and remarkably pleasant
      to the individual principally concerned, if he or she can but manage to
      come out with a burst, and being out, to keep out, and not go in again;
      but, it does unfortunately happen that both consummations are extremely
      difficult to accomplish, and that the difficulties, of getting out at all
      in the first instance, and if you surmount them, of keeping out in the
      second, are pretty much on a par, and no slight ones either-and so Miss
      Amelia Martin shortly discovered. It is a singular fact (there being
      ladies in the case) that Miss Amelia Martin's principal foible was vanity,
      and the leading characteristic of Mrs. Jennings Rodolph an attachment to
      dress. Dismal wailings were heard to issue from the second-floor front of
      number forty-seven, Drummond- street, George-street, Euston-square; it was
      Miss Martin practising. Half-suppressed murmurs disturbed the calm dignity
      of the White Conduit orchestra at the commencement of the season. It was
      the appearance of Mrs. Jennings Rodolph in full dress, that occasioned
      them. Miss Martin studied incessantly-the practising was the consequence.
      Mrs. Jennings Rodolph taught gratuitously now and then-the dresses were
      the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks passed away; the White Conduit season had begun, and progressed, and
      was more than half over. The dressmaking business had fallen off, from
      neglect; and its profits had dwindled away almost imperceptibly. A
      benefit-night approached; Mr. Jennings Rodolph yielded to the earnest
      solicitations of Miss Amelia Martin, and introduced her personally to the
      'comic gentleman' whose benefit it was. The comic gentleman was all smiles
      and blandness-he had composed a duet, expressly for the occasion, and Miss
      Martin should sing it with him. The night arrived; there was an immense
      room-ninety-seven sixpenn'orths of gin-and-water, thirty-two small glasses
      of brandy-and-water, five-and-twenty bottled ales, and forty-one neguses;
      and the ornamental painter's journeyman, with his wife and a select circle
      of acquaintance, were seated at one of the side-tables near the orchestra.
      The concert began. Song-sentimental-by a light-haired young gentleman in a
      blue coat, and bright basket buttons-[applause]. Another song, doubtful,
      by another gentleman in another blue coat and more bright basket
      buttons-[increased applause]. Duet, Mr. Jennings Rodolph, and Mrs.
      Jennings Rodolph, 'Red Ruffian, retire!'-[great applause]. Solo, Miss
      Julia Montague (positively on this occasion only)-'I am a
      Friar'-[enthusiasm]. Original duet, comic-Mr. H. Taplin (the comic
      gentleman) and Miss Martin-'The Time of Day.' 'Brayvo!-Brayvo!' cried the
      ornamental painter's journeyman's party, as Miss Martin was gracefully led
      in by the comic gentleman. 'Go to work, Harry,' cried the comic
      gentleman's personal friends. 'Tap- tap-tap,' went the leader's bow on the
      music-desk. The symphony began, and was soon afterwards followed by a
      faint kind of ventriloquial chirping, proceeding apparently from the
      deepest recesses of the interior of Miss Amelia Martin. 'Sing out'-shouted
      one gentleman in a white great-coat. 'Don't be afraid to put the steam on,
      old gal,' exclaimed another, 'S-s-s-s-s-s-s'-went the five-and-twenty
      bottled ales. 'Shame, shame!' remonstrated the ornamental painter's
      journeyman's party-'S-s-s-s' went the bottled ales again, accompanied by
      all the gins, and a majority of the brandies.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Turn them geese out,' cried the ornamental painter's journeyman's party,
      with great indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sing out,' whispered Mr. Jennings Rodolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So I do,' responded Miss Amelia Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sing louder,' said Mrs. Jennings Rodolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't,' replied Miss Amelia Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Off, off, off,' cried the rest of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bray-vo!' shouted the painter's party. It wouldn't do-Miss Amelia Martin
      left the orchestra, with much less ceremony than she had entered it; and,
      as she couldn't sing out, never came out. The general good humour was not
      restored until Mr. Jennings Rodolph had become purple in the face, by
      imitating divers quadrupeds for half an hour, without being able to render
      himself audible; and, to this day, neither has Miss Amelia Martin's good
      humour been restored, nor the dresses made for and presented to Mrs.
      Jennings Rodolph, nor the local abilities which Mr. Jennings Rodolph once
      staked his professional reputation that Miss Martin possessed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX-THE DANCING ACADEMY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all the dancing academies that ever were established, there never was
      one more popular in its immediate vicinity than Signor Billsmethi's, of
      the 'King's Theatre.' It was not in Spring-gardens, or Newman-street, or
      Berners-street, or Gower-street, or Charlotte-street, or Percy- street, or
      any other of the numerous streets which have been devoted time out of mind
      to professional people, dispensaries, and boarding- houses; it was not in
      the West-end at all-it rather approximated to the eastern portion of
      London, being situated in the populous and improving neighbourhood of
      Gray's-inn-lane. It was not a dear dancing academy-four-and-sixpence a
      quarter is decidedly cheap upon the whole. It was very select, the number
      of pupils being strictly limited to seventy-five, and a quarter's payment
      in advance being rigidly exacted. There was public tuition and private
      tuition-an assembly-room and a parlour. Signor Billsmethi's family were
      always thrown in with the parlour, and included in parlour price; that is
      to say, a private pupil had Signor Billsmethi's parlour to dance in, and
      Signor Billsmethi's family to dance with; and when he had been
      sufficiently broken in in the parlour, he began to run in couples in the
      assembly-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the dancing academy of Signor Billsmethi, when Mr. Augustus
      Cooper, of Fetter-lane, first saw an unstamped advertisement walking
      leisurely down Holborn-hill, announcing to the world that Signor
      Billsmethi, of the King's Theatre, intended opening for the season with a
      Grand Ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. Augustus Cooper was in the oil and colour line-just of age, with
      a little money, a little business, and a little mother, who, having
      managed her husband and his business in his lifetime, took to managing her
      son and his business after his decease; and so, somehow or other, he had
      been cooped up in the little back parlour behind the shop on week- days,
      and in a little deal box without a lid (called by courtesy a pew) at
      Bethel Chapel, on Sundays, and had seen no more of the world than if he
      had been an infant all his days; whereas Young White, at the gas- fitter's
      over the way, three years younger than him, had been flaring away like
      winkin'-going to the theatre-supping at harmonic meetings-eating oysters
      by the barrel-drinking stout by the gallon-even out all night, and coming
      home as cool in the morning as if nothing had happened. So Mr. Augustus
      Cooper made up his mind that he would not stand it any longer, and had
      that very morning expressed to his mother a firm determination to be
      'blowed,' in the event of his not being instantly provided with a
      street-door key. And he was walking down Holborn-hill, thinking about all
      these things, and wondering how he could manage to get introduced into
      genteel society for the first time, when his eyes rested on Signor
      Billsmethi's announcement, which it immediately struck him was just the
      very thing he wanted; for he should not only be able to select a genteel
      circle of acquaintance at once, out of the five-and-seventy pupils at
      four-and-sixpence a quarter, but should qualify himself at the same time
      to go through a hornpipe in private society, with perfect ease to himself
      and great delight to his friends. So, he stopped the unstamped
      advertisement-an animated sandwich, composed of a boy between two
      boards-and having procured a very small card with the Signor's address
      indented thereon, walked straight at once to the Signor's house-and very
      fast he walked too, for fear the list should be filled up, and the
      five-and-seventy completed, before he got there. The Signor was at home,
      and, what was still more gratifying, he was an Englishman! Such a nice
      man-and so polite! The list was not full, but it was a most extraordinary
      circumstance that there was only just one vacancy, and even that one would
      have been filled up, that very morning, only Signor Billsmethi was
      dissatisfied with the reference, and, being very much afraid that the lady
      wasn't select, wouldn't take her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And very much delighted I am, Mr. Cooper,' said Signor Billsmethi, 'that
      I did not take her. I assure you, Mr. Cooper-I don't say it to flatter
      you, for I know you're above it-that I consider myself extremely fortunate
      in having a gentleman of your manners and appearance, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am very glad of it too, sir,' said Augustus Cooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I hope we shall be better acquainted, sir,' said Signor Billsmethi.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I'm sure I hope we shall too, sir,' responded Augustus Cooper. Just
      then, the door opened, and in came a young lady, with her hair curled in a
      crop all over her head, and her shoes tied in sandals all over her ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't run away, my dear,' said Signor Billsmethi; for the young lady
      didn't know Mr. Cooper was there when she ran in, and was going to run out
      again in her modesty, all in confusion-like. 'Don't run away, my dear,'
      said Signor Billsmethi, 'this is Mr. Cooper-Mr. Cooper, of Fetter-lane.
      Mr. Cooper, my daughter, sir-Miss Billsmethi, sir, who I hope will have
      the pleasure of dancing many a quadrille, minuet, gavotte, country-dance,
      fandango, double-hornpipe, and farinagholkajingo with you, sir. She dances
      them all, sir; and so shall you, sir, before you're a quarter older, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And Signor Bellsmethi slapped Mr. Augustus Cooper on the back, as if he
      had known him a dozen years,-so friendly;-and Mr. Cooper bowed to the
      young lady, and the young lady curtseyed to him, and Signor Billsmethi
      said they were as handsome a pair as ever he'd wish to see; upon which the
      young lady exclaimed, 'Lor, pa!' and blushed as red as Mr. Cooper
      himself-you might have thought they were both standing under a red lamp at
      a chemist's shop; and before Mr. Cooper went away it was settled that he
      should join the family circle that very night-taking them just as they
      were-no ceremony nor nonsense of that kind-and learn his positions in
      order that he might lose no time, and be able to come out at the
      forthcoming ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well; Mr. Augustus Cooper went away to one of the cheap shoemakers' shops
      in Holborn, where gentlemen's dress-pumps are seven-and-sixpence, and
      men's strong walking just nothing at all, and bought a pair of the regular
      seven-and-sixpenny, long-quartered, town-mades, in which he astonished
      himself quite as much as his mother, and sallied forth to Signor
      Billsmethi's. There were four other private pupils in the parlour: two
      ladies and two gentlemen. Such nice people! Not a bit of pride about them.
      One of the ladies in particular, who was in training for a Columbine, was
      remarkably affable; and she and Miss Billsmethi took such an interest in
      Mr. Augustus Cooper, and joked, and smiled, and looked so bewitching, that
      he got quite at home, and learnt his steps in no time. After the
      practising was over, Signor Billsmethi, and Miss Billsmethi, and Master
      Billsmethi, and a young lady, and the two ladies, and the two gentlemen,
      danced a quadrille-none of your slipping and sliding about, but regular
      warm work, flying into corners, and diving among chairs, and shooting out
      at the door,-something like dancing! Signor Billsmethi in particular,
      notwithstanding his having a little fiddle to play all the time, was out
      on the landing every figure, and Master Billsmethi, when everybody else
      was breathless, danced a hornpipe, with a cane in his hand, and a
      cheese-plate on his head, to the unqualified admiration of the whole
      company. Then, Signor Billsmethi insisted, as they were so happy, that
      they should all stay to supper, and proposed sending Master Billsmethi for
      the beer and spirits, whereupon the two gentlemen swore, 'strike 'em
      wulgar if they'd stand that;' and were just going to quarrel who should
      pay for it, when Mr. Augustus Cooper said he would, if they'd have the
      kindness to allow him-and they had the kindness to allow him; and Master
      Billsmethi brought the beer in a can, and the rum in a quart pot. They had
      a regular night of it; and Miss Billsmethi squeezed Mr. Augustus Cooper's
      hand under the table; and Mr. Augustus Cooper returned the squeeze, and
      returned home too, at something to six o'clock in the morning, when he was
      put to bed by main force by the apprentice, after repeatedly expressing an
      uncontrollable desire to pitch his revered parent out of the second-floor
      window, and to throttle the apprentice with his own neck-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks had worn on, and the seven-and-sixpenny town-mades had nearly worn
      out, when the night arrived for the grand dress-ball at which the whole of
      the five-and-seventy pupils were to meet together, for the first time that
      season, and to take out some portion of their respective four-and-
      sixpences in lamp-oil and fiddlers. Mr. Augustus Cooper had ordered a new
      coat for the occasion-a two-pound-tenner from Turnstile. It was his first
      appearance in public; and, after a grand Sicilian shawl-dance by fourteen
      young ladies in character, he was to open the quadrille department with
      Miss Billsmethi herself, with whom he had become quite intimate since his
      first introduction. It was a night! Everything was admirably arranged. The
      sandwich-boy took the hats and bonnets at the street-door; there was a
      turn-up bedstead in the back parlour, on which Miss Billsmethi made tea
      and coffee for such of the gentlemen as chose to pay for it, and such of
      the ladies as the gentlemen treated; red port-wine negus and lemonade were
      handed round at eighteen-pence a head; and in pursuance of a previous
      engagement with the public-house at the corner of the street, an extra
      potboy was laid on for the occasion. In short, nothing could exceed the
      arrangements, except the company. Such ladies! Such pink silk stockings!
      Such artificial flowers! Such a number of cabs! No sooner had one cab set
      down a couple of ladies, than another cab drove up and set down another
      couple of ladies, and they all knew: not only one another, but the
      majority of the gentlemen into the bargain, which made it all as pleasant
      and lively as could be. Signor Billsmethi, in black tights, with a large
      blue bow in his buttonhole, introduced the ladies to such of the gentlemen
      as were strangers: and the ladies talked away-and laughed they did-it was
      delightful to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the shawl-dance, it was the most exciting thing that ever was
      beheld; there was such a whisking, and rustling, and fanning, and getting
      ladies into a tangle with artificial flowers, and then disentangling them
      again! And as to Mr. Augustus Cooper's share in the quadrille, he got
      through it admirably. He was missing from his partner, now and then,
      certainly, and discovered on such occasions to be either dancing with
      laudable perseverance in another set, or sliding about in perspective,
      without any definite object; but, generally speaking, they managed to
      shove him through the figure, until he turned up in the right place. Be
      this as it may, when he had finished, a great many ladies and gentlemen
      came up and complimented him very much, and said they had never seen a
      beginner do anything like it before; and Mr. Augustus Cooper was perfectly
      satisfied with himself, and everybody else into the bargain; and 'stood'
      considerable quantities of spirits-and- water, negus, and compounds, for
      the use and behoof of two or three dozen very particular friends, selected
      from the select circle of five- and-seventy pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, whether it was the strength of the compounds, or the beauty of the
      ladies, or what not, it did so happen that Mr. Augustus Cooper encouraged,
      rather than repelled, the very flattering attentions of a young lady in
      brown gauze over white calico who had appeared particularly struck with
      him from the first; and when the encouragements had been prolonged for
      some time, Miss Billsmethi betrayed her spite and jealousy thereat by
      calling the young lady in brown gauze a 'creeter,' which induced the young
      lady in brown gauze to retort, in certain sentences containing a taunt
      founded on the payment of four-and-sixpence a quarter, which reference Mr.
      Augustus Cooper, being then and there in a state of considerable
      bewilderment, expressed his entire concurrence in. Miss Billsmethi, thus
      renounced, forthwith began screaming in the loudest key of her voice, at
      the rate of fourteen screams a minute; and being unsuccessful, in an
      onslaught on the eyes and face, first of the lady in gauze and then of Mr.
      Augustus Cooper, called distractedly on the other three-and-seventy pupils
      to furnish her with oxalic acid for her own private drinking; and, the
      call not being honoured, made another rush at Mr. Cooper, and then had her
      stay-lace cut, and was carried off to bed. Mr. Augustus Cooper, not being
      remarkable for quickness of apprehension, was at a loss to understand what
      all this meant, until Signor Billsmethi explained it in a most
      satisfactory manner, by stating to the pupils, that Mr. Augustus Cooper
      had made and confirmed divers promises of marriage to his daughter on
      divers occasions, and had now basely deserted her; on which, the
      indignation of the pupils became universal; and as several chivalrous
      gentlemen inquired rather pressingly of Mr. Augustus Cooper, whether he
      required anything for his own use, or, in other words, whether he 'wanted
      anything for himself,' he deemed it prudent to make a precipitate retreat.
      And the upshot of the matter was, that a lawyer's letter came next day,
      and an action was commenced next week; and that Mr. Augustus Cooper, after
      walking twice to the Serpentine for the purpose of drowning himself, and
      coming twice back without doing it, made a confidante of his mother, who
      compromised the matter with twenty pounds from the till: which made twenty
      pounds four shillings and sixpence paid to Signor Billsmethi, exclusive of
      treats and pumps. And Mr. Augustus Cooper went back and lived with his
      mother, and there he lives to this day; and as he has lost his ambition
      for society, and never goes into the world, he will never see this account
      of himself, and will never be any the wiser.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X-SHABBY-GENTEEL PEOPLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are certain descriptions of people who, oddly enough, appear to
      appertain exclusively to the metropolis. You meet them, every day, in the
      streets of London, but no one ever encounters them elsewhere; they seem
      indigenous to the soil, and to belong as exclusively to London as its own
      smoke, or the dingy bricks and mortar. We could illustrate the remark by a
      variety of examples, but, in our present sketch, we will only advert to
      one class as a specimen-that class which is so aptly and expressively
      designated as 'shabby-genteel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, shabby people, God knows, may be found anywhere, and genteel people
      are not articles of greater scarcity out of London than in it; but this
      compound of the two-this shabby-gentility-is as purely local as the statue
      at Charing-cross, or the pump at Aldgate. It is worthy of remark, too,
      that only men are shabby-genteel; a woman is always either dirty and
      slovenly in the extreme, or neat and respectable, however poverty-stricken
      in appearance. A very poor man, 'who has seen better days,' as the phrase
      goes, is a strange compound of dirty-slovenliness and wretched attempts at
      faded smartness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will endeavour to explain our conception of the term which forms the
      title of this paper. If you meet a man, lounging up Drury-Lane, or leaning
      with his back against a post in Long-acre, with his hands in the pockets
      of a pair of drab trousers plentifully besprinkled with grease- spots: the
      trousers made very full over the boots, and ornamented with two cords down
      the outside of each leg-wearing, also, what has been a brown coat with
      bright buttons, and a hat very much pinched up at the side, cocked over
      his right eye-don't pity him. He is not shabby- genteel. The 'harmonic
      meetings' at some fourth-rate public-house, or the purlieus of a private
      theatre, are his chosen haunts; he entertains a rooted antipathy to any
      kind of work, and is on familiar terms with several pantomime men at the
      large houses. But, if you see hurrying along a by-street, keeping as close
      as he can to the area-railings, a man of about forty or fifty, clad in an
      old rusty suit of threadbare black cloth which shines with constant wear
      as if it had been bees- waxed-the trousers tightly strapped down, partly
      for the look of the thing and partly to keep his old shoes from slipping
      off at the heels,-if you observe, too, that his yellowish-white
      neckerchief is carefully pinned up, to conceal the tattered garment
      underneath, and that his hands are encased in the remains of an old pair
      of beaver gloves, you may set him down as a shabby-genteel man. A glance
      at that depressed face, and timorous air of conscious poverty, will make
      your heart ache-always supposing that you are neither a philosopher nor a
      political economist.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were once haunted by a shabby-genteel man; he was bodily present to our
      senses all day, and he was in our mind's eye all night. The man of whom
      Sir Walter Scott speaks in his Demonology, did not suffer half the
      persecution from his imaginary gentleman-usher in black velvet, that we
      sustained from our friend in quondam black cloth. He first attracted our
      notice, by sitting opposite to us in the reading-room at the British
      Museum; and what made the man more remarkable was, that he always had
      before him a couple of shabby-genteel books-two old dog's-eared folios, in
      mouldy worm-eaten covers, which had once been smart. He was in his chair,
      every morning, just as the clock struck ten; he was always the last to
      leave the room in the afternoon; and when he did, he quitted it with the
      air of a man who knew not where else to go, for warmth and quiet. There he
      used to sit all day, as close to the table as possible, in order to
      conceal the lack of buttons on his coat: with his old hat carefully
      deposited at his feet, where he evidently flattered himself it escaped
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two o'clock, you would see him munching a French roll or a penny
      loaf; not taking it boldly out of his pocket at once, like a man who knew
      he was only making a lunch; but breaking off little bits in his pocket,
      and eating them by stealth. He knew too well it was his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we first saw this poor object, we thought it quite impossible that
      his attire could ever become worse. We even went so far, as to speculate
      on the possibility of his shortly appearing in a decent second-hand suit.
      We knew nothing about the matter; he grew more and more shabby-genteel
      every day. The buttons dropped off his waistcoat, one by one; then, he
      buttoned his coat; and when one side of the coat was reduced to the same
      condition as the waistcoat, he buttoned it over-on the other side. He
      looked somewhat better at the beginning of the week than at the
      conclusion, because the neckerchief, though yellow, was not quite so
      dingy; and, in the midst of all this wretchedness, he never appeared
      without gloves and straps. He remained in this state for a week or two. At
      length, one of the buttons on the back of the coat fell off, and then the
      man himself disappeared, and we thought he was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were sitting at the same table about a week after his disappearance,
      and as our eyes rested on his vacant chair, we insensibly fell into a
      train of meditation on the subject of his retirement from public life. We
      were wondering whether he had hung himself, or thrown himself off a
      bridge-whether he really was dead or had only been arrested-when our
      conjectures were suddenly set at rest by the entry of the man himself. He
      had undergone some strange metamorphosis, and walked up the centre of the
      room with an air which showed he was fully conscious of the improvement in
      his appearance. It was very odd. His clothes were a fine, deep, glossy
      black; and yet they looked like the same suit; nay, there were the very
      darns with which old acquaintance had made us familiar. The hat,
      too-nobody could mistake the shape of that hat, with its high crown
      gradually increasing in circumference towards the top. Long service had
      imparted to it a reddish-brown tint; but, now, it was as black as the
      coat. The truth flashed suddenly upon us-they had been 'revived.' It is a
      deceitful liquid that black and blue reviver; we have watched its effects
      on many a shabby-genteel man. It betrays its victims into a temporary
      assumption of importance: possibly into the purchase of a new pair of
      gloves, or a cheap stock, or some other trifling article of dress. It
      elevates their spirits for a week, only to depress them, if possible,
      below their original level. It was so in this case; the transient dignity
      of the unhappy man decreased, in exact proportion as the 'reviver' wore
      off. The knees of the unmentionables, and the elbows of the coat, and the
      seams generally, soon began to get alarmingly white. The hat was once more
      deposited under the table, and its owner crept into his seat as quietly as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a week of incessant small rain and mist. At its expiration the
      'reviver' had entirely vanished, and the shabby-genteel man never
      afterwards attempted to effect any improvement in his outward appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to name any particular part of town as the principal
      resort of shabby-genteel men. We have met a great many persons of this
      description in the neighbourhood of the inns of court. They may be met
      with, in Holborn, between eight and ten any morning; and whoever has the
      curiosity to enter the Insolvent Debtors' Court will observe, both among
      spectators and practitioners, a great variety of them. We never went on
      'Change, by any chance, without seeing some shabby-genteel men, and we
      have often wondered what earthly business they can have there. They will
      sit there, for hours, leaning on great, dropsical, mildewed umbrellas, or
      eating Abernethy biscuits. Nobody speaks to them, nor they to any one. On
      consideration, we remember to have occasionally seen two shabby-genteel
      men conversing together on 'Change, but our experience assures us that
      this is an uncommon circumstance, occasioned by the offer of a pinch of
      snuff, or some such civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a task of equal difficulty, either to assign any particular
      spot for the residence of these beings, or to endeavour to enumerate their
      general occupations. We were never engaged in business with more than one
      shabby-genteel man; and he was a drunken engraver, and lived in a damp
      back-parlour in a new row of houses at Camden-town, half street, half
      brick-field, somewhere near the canal. A shabby-genteel man may have no
      occupation, or he may be a corn agent, or a coal agent, or a wine
      merchant, or a collector of debts, or a broker's assistant, or a
      broken-down attorney. He may be a clerk of the lowest description, or a
      contributor to the press of the same grade. Whether our readers have
      noticed these men, in their walks, as often as we have, we know not; this
      we know-that the miserably poor man (no matter whether he owes his
      distresses to his own conduct, or that of others) who feels his poverty
      and vainly strives to conceal it, is one of the most pitiable objects in
      human nature. Such objects, with few exceptions, are shabby-genteel
      people.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI-MAKING A NIGHT OF IT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Damon and Pythias were undoubtedly very good fellows in their way: the
      former for his extreme readiness to put in special bail for a friend: and
      the latter for a certain trump-like punctuality in turning up just in the
      very nick of time, scarcely less remarkable. Many points in their
      character have, however, grown obsolete. Damons are rather hard to find,
      in these days of imprisonment for debt (except the sham ones, and they
      cost half-a-crown); and, as to the Pythiases, the few that have existed in
      these degenerate times, have had an unfortunate knack of making themselves
      scarce, at the very moment when their appearance would have been strictly
      classical. If the actions of these heroes, however, can find no parallel
      in modern times, their friendship can. We have Damon and Pythias on the
      one hand. We have Potter and Smithers on the other; and, lest the two
      last-mentioned names should never have reached the ears of our
      unenlightened readers, we can do no better than make them acquainted with
      the owners thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thomas Potter, then, was a clerk in the city, and Mr. Robert Smithers
      was a ditto in the same; their incomes were limited, but their friendship
      was unbounded. They lived in the same street, walked into town every
      morning at the same hour, dined at the same slap-bang every day, and
      revelled in each other's company very night. They were knit together by
      the closest ties of intimacy and friendship, or, as Mr. Thomas Potter
      touchingly observed, they were 'thick-and-thin pals, and nothing but it.'
      There was a spice of romance in Mr. Smithers's disposition, a ray of
      poetry, a gleam of misery, a sort of consciousness of he didn't exactly
      know what, coming across him he didn't precisely know why-which stood out
      in fine relief against the off-hand, dashing,
      amateur-pickpocket-sort-of-manner, which distinguished Mr. Potter in an
      eminent degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiarity of their respective dispositions, extended itself to their
      individual costume. Mr. Smithers generally appeared in public in a surtout
      and shoes, with a narrow black neckerchief and a brown hat, very much
      turned up at the sides-peculiarities which Mr. Potter wholly eschewed, for
      it was his ambition to do something in the celebrated 'kiddy' or
      stage-coach way, and he had even gone so far as to invest capital in the
      purchase of a rough blue coat with wooden buttons, made upon the fireman's
      principle, in which, with the addition of a low- crowned,
      flower-pot-saucer-shaped hat, he had created no inconsiderable sensation
      at the Albion in Little Russell-street, and divers other places of public
      and fashionable resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Potter and Mr. Smithers had mutually agreed that, on the receipt of
      their quarter's salary, they would jointly and in company 'spend the
      evening'-an evident misnomer-the spending applying, as everybody knows,
      not to the evening itself but to all the money the individual may chance
      to be possessed of, on the occasion to which reference is made; and they
      had likewise agreed that, on the evening aforesaid, they would 'make a
      night of it'-an expressive term, implying the borrowing of several hours
      from to-morrow morning, adding them to the night before, and manufacturing
      a compound night of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarter-day arrived at last-we say at last, because quarter-days are
      as eccentric as comets: moving wonderfully quick when you have a good deal
      to pay, and marvellously slow when you have a little to receive. Mr.
      Thomas Potter and Mr. Robert Smithers met by appointment to begin the
      evening with a dinner; and a nice, snug, comfortable dinner they had,
      consisting of a little procession of four chops and four kidneys,
      following each other, supported on either side by a pot of the real
      draught stout, and attended by divers cushions of bread, and wedges of
      cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cloth was removed, Mr. Thomas Potter ordered the waiter to bring
      in, two goes of his best Scotch whiskey, with warm water and sugar, and a
      couple of his 'very mildest' Havannahs, which the waiter did. Mr. Thomas
      Potter mixed his grog, and lighted his cigar; Mr. Robert Smithers did the
      same; and then, Mr. Thomas Potter jocularly proposed as the first toast,
      'the abolition of all offices whatever' (not sinecures, but
      counting-houses), which was immediately drunk by Mr. Robert Smithers, with
      enthusiastic applause. So they went on, talking politics, puffing cigars,
      and sipping whiskey-and-water, until the 'goes'-most appropriately so
      called-were both gone, which Mr. Robert Smithers perceiving, immediately
      ordered in two more goes of the best Scotch whiskey, and two more of the
      very mildest Havannahs; and the goes kept coming in, and the mild
      Havannahs kept going out, until, what with the drinking, and lighting, and
      puffing, and the stale ashes on the table, and the tallow-grease on the
      cigars, Mr. Robert Smithers began to doubt the mildness of the Havannahs,
      and to feel very much as if he had been sitting in a hackney-coach with
      his back to the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Mr. Thomas Potter, he would keep laughing out loud, and volunteering
      inarticulate declarations that he was 'all right;' in proof of which, he
      feebly bespoke the evening paper after the next gentleman, but finding it
      a matter of some difficulty to discover any news in its columns, or to
      ascertain distinctly whether it had any columns at all, walked slowly out
      to look for the moon, and, after coming back quite pale with looking up at
      the sky so long, and attempting to express mirth at Mr. Robert Smithers
      having fallen asleep, by various galvanic chuckles, laid his head on his
      arm, and went to sleep also. When he awoke again, Mr. Robert Smithers
      awoke too, and they both very gravely agreed that it was extremely unwise
      to eat so many pickled walnuts with the chops, as it was a notorious fact
      that they always made people queer and sleepy; indeed, if it had not been
      for the whiskey and cigars, there was no knowing what harm they mightn't
      have done 'em. So they took some coffee, and after paying the bill,-twelve
      and twopence the dinner, and the odd tenpence for the waiter-thirteen
      shillings in all-started out on their expedition to manufacture a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just half-past eight, so they thought they couldn't do better than
      go at half-price to the slips at the City Theatre, which they did
      accordingly. Mr. Robert Smithers, who had become extremely poetical after
      the settlement of the bill, enlivening the walk by informing Mr. Thomas
      Potter in confidence that he felt an inward presentiment of approaching
      dissolution, and subsequently embellishing the theatre, by falling asleep
      with his head and both arms gracefully drooping over the front of the
      boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the quiet demeanour of the unassuming Smithers, and such were the
      happy effects of Scotch whiskey and Havannahs on that interesting person!
      But Mr. Thomas Potter, whose great aim it was to be considered as a
      'knowing card,' a 'fast-goer,' and so forth, conducted himself in a very
      different manner, and commenced going very fast indeed-rather too fast at
      last, for the patience of the audience to keep pace with him. On his first
      entry, he contented himself by earnestly calling upon the gentlemen in the
      gallery to 'flare up,' accompanying the demand with another request,
      expressive of his wish that they would instantaneously 'form a union,'
      both which requisitions were responded to, in the manner most in vogue on
      such occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Give that dog a bone!' cried one gentleman in his shirt-sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where have you been a having half a pint of intermediate beer?' cried a
      second. 'Tailor!' screamed a third. 'Barber's clerk!' shouted a fourth.
      'Throw him o-ver!' roared a fifth; while numerous voices concurred in
      desiring Mr. Thomas Potter to 'go home to his mother!' All these taunts
      Mr. Thomas Potter received with supreme contempt, cocking the low-crowned
      hat a little more on one side, whenever any reference was made to his
      personal appearance, and, standing up with his arms a- kimbo, expressing
      defiance melodramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overture-to which these various sounds had been an ad libitum
      accompaniment-concluded, the second piece began, and Mr. Thomas Potter,
      emboldened by impunity, proceeded to behave in a most unprecedented and
      outrageous manner. First of all, he imitated the shake of the principal
      female singer; then, groaned at the blue fire; then, affected to be
      frightened into convulsions of terror at the appearance of the ghost; and,
      lastly, not only made a running commentary, in an audible voice, upon the
      dialogue on the stage, but actually awoke Mr. Robert Smithers, who,
      hearing his companion making a noise, and having a very indistinct notion
      where he was, or what was required of him, immediately, by way of
      imitating a good example, set up the most unearthly, unremitting, and
      appalling howling that ever audience heard. It was too much. 'Turn them
      out!' was the general cry. A noise, as of shuffling of feet, and men being
      knocked up with violence against wainscoting, was heard: a hurried
      dialogue of 'Come out?'-'I won't!'-'You shall!'-'I shan't!'-'Give me your
      card, Sir?'-'You're a scoundrel, Sir!' and so forth, succeeded. A round of
      applause betokened the approbation of the audience, and Mr. Robert
      Smithers and Mr. Thomas Potter found themselves shot with astonishing
      swiftness into the road, without having had the trouble of once putting
      foot to ground during the whole progress of their rapid descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Smithers, being constitutionally one of the slow-goers, and
      having had quite enough of fast-going, in the course of his recent
      expulsion, to last until the quarter-day then next ensuing at the very
      least, had no sooner emerged with his companion from the precincts of
      Milton-street, than he proceeded to indulge in circuitous references to
      the beauties of sleep, mingled with distant allusions to the propriety of
      returning to Islington, and testing the influence of their patent Bramahs
      over the street-door locks to which they respectively belonged. Mr. Thomas
      Potter, however, was valorous and peremptory. They had come out to make a
      night of it: and a night must be made. So Mr. Robert Smithers, who was
      three parts dull, and the other dismal, despairingly assented; and they
      went into a wine-vaults, to get materials for assisting them in making a
      night; where they found a good many young ladies, and various old
      gentlemen, and a plentiful sprinkling of hackney-coachmen and cab-drivers,
      all drinking and talking together; and Mr. Thomas Potter and Mr. Robert
      Smithers drank small glasses of brandy, and large glasses of soda, until
      they began to have a very confused idea, either of things in general, or
      of anything in particular; and, when they had done treating themselves
      they began to treat everybody else; and the rest of the entertainment was
      a confused mixture of heads and heels, black eyes and blue uniforms, mud
      and gas-lights, thick doors, and stone paving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as standard novelists expressively inform us-'all was a blank!' and
      in the morning the blank was filled up with the words 'Station- house,'
      and the station-house was filled up with Mr. Thomas Potter, Mr. Robert
      Smithers, and the major part of their wine-vault companions of the
      preceding night, with a comparatively small portion of clothing of any
      kind. And it was disclosed at the Police-office, to the indignation of the
      Bench, and the astonishment of the spectators, how one Robert Smithers,
      aided and abetted by one Thomas Potter, had knocked down and beaten, in
      divers streets, at different times, five men, four boys, and three women;
      how the said Thomas Potter had feloniously obtained possession of five
      door-knockers, two bell-handles, and a bonnet; how Robert Smithers, his
      friend, had sworn, at least forty pounds' worth of oaths, at the rate of
      five shillings apiece; terrified whole streets full of Her Majesty's
      subjects with awful shrieks and alarms of fire; destroyed the uniforms of
      five policemen; and committed various other atrocities, too numerous to
      recapitulate. And the magistrate, after an appropriate reprimand, fined
      Mr. Thomas Potter and Mr. Thomas Smithers five shillings each, for being,
      what the law vulgarly terms, drunk; and thirty-four pounds for seventeen
      assaults at forty shillings a-head, with liberty to speak to the
      prosecutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prosecutors were spoken to, and Messrs. Potter and Smithers lived on
      credit, for a quarter, as best they might; and, although the prosecutors
      expressed their readiness to be assaulted twice a week, on the same terms,
      they have never since been detected in 'making a night of it.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII-THE PRISONERS' VAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      We were passing the corner of Bow-street, on our return from a lounging
      excursion the other afternoon, when a crowd, assembled round the door of
      the Police-office, attracted our attention. We turned up the street
      accordingly. There were thirty or forty people, standing on the pavement
      and half across the road; and a few stragglers were patiently stationed on
      the opposite side of the way-all evidently waiting in expectation of some
      arrival. We waited too, a few minutes, but nothing occurred; so, we turned
      round to an unshorn, sallow-looking cobbler, who was standing next us with
      his hands under the bib of his apron, and put the usual question of
      'What's the matter?' The cobbler eyed us from head to foot, with
      superlative contempt, and laconically replied 'Nuffin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we were perfectly aware that if two men stop in the street to look at
      any given object, or even to gaze in the air, two hundred men will be
      assembled in no time; but, as we knew very well that no crowd of people
      could by possibility remain in a street for five minutes without getting
      up a little amusement among themselves, unless they had some absorbing
      object in view, the natural inquiry next in order was, 'What are all these
      people waiting here for?'-'Her Majesty's carriage,' replied the cobbler.
      This was still more extraordinary. We could not imagine what earthly
      business Her Majesty's carriage could have at the Public Office,
      Bow-street. We were beginning to ruminate on the possible causes of such
      an uncommon appearance, when a general exclamation from all the boys in
      the crowd of 'Here's the wan!' caused us to raise our heads, and look up
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The covered vehicle, in which prisoners are conveyed from the police-
      offices to the different prisons, was coming along at full speed. It then
      occurred to us, for the first time, that Her Majesty's carriage was merely
      another name for the prisoners' van, conferred upon it, not only by reason
      of the superior gentility of the term, but because the aforesaid van is
      maintained at Her Majesty's expense: having been originally started for
      the exclusive accommodation of ladies and gentlemen under the necessity of
      visiting the various houses of call known by the general denomination of
      'Her Majesty's Gaols.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The van drew up at the office-door, and the people thronged round the
      steps, just leaving a little alley for the prisoners to pass through. Our
      friend the cobbler, and the other stragglers, crossed over, and we
      followed their example. The driver, and another man who had been seated by
      his side in front of the vehicle, dismounted, and were admitted into the
      office. The office-door was closed after them, and the crowd were on the
      tiptoe of expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes' delay, the door again opened, and the two first
      prisoners appeared. They were a couple of girls, of whom the elder-could
      not be more than sixteen, and the younger of whom had certainly not
      attained her fourteenth year. That they were sisters, was evident, from
      the resemblance which still subsisted between them, though two additional
      years of depravity had fixed their brand upon the elder girl's features,
      as legibly as if a red-hot iron had seared them. They were both gaudily
      dressed, the younger one especially; and, although there was a strong
      similarity between them in both respects, which was rendered the more
      obvious by their being handcuffed together, it is impossible to conceive a
      greater contrast than the demeanour of the two presented. The younger girl
      was weeping bitterly-not for display, or in the hope of producing effect,
      but for very shame: her face was buried in her handkerchief: and her whole
      manner was but too expressive of bitter and unavailing sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How long are you for, Emily?' screamed a red-faced woman in the crowd.
      'Six weeks and labour,' replied the elder girl with a flaunting laugh;
      'and that's better than the stone jug anyhow; the mill's a deal better
      than the Sessions, and here's Bella a-going too for the first time. Hold
      up your head, you chicken,' she continued, boisterously tearing the other
      girl's handkerchief away; 'Hold up your head, and show 'em your face. I
      an't jealous, but I'm blessed if I an't game!'-'That's right, old gal,'
      exclaimed a man in a paper cap, who, in common with the greater part of
      the crowd, had been inexpressibly delighted with this little
      incident.-'Right!' replied the girl; 'ah, to be sure; what's the odds,
      eh?'-'Come! In with you,' interrupted the driver. 'Don't you be in a
      hurry, coachman,' replied the girl, 'and recollect I want to be set down
      in Cold Bath Fields-large house with a high garden-wall in front; you
      can't mistake it. Hallo. Bella, where are you going to-you'll pull my
      precious arm off?' This was addressed to the younger girl, who, in her
      anxiety to hide herself in the caravan, had ascended the steps first, and
      forgotten the strain upon the handcuff. 'Come down, and let's show you the
      way.' And after jerking the miserable girl down with a force which made
      her stagger on the pavement, she got into the vehicle, and was followed by
      her wretched companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two girls had been thrown upon London streets, their vices and
      debauchery, by a sordid and rapacious mother. What the younger girl was
      then, the elder had been once; and what the elder then was, the younger
      must soon become. A melancholy prospect, but how surely to be realised; a
      tragic drama, but how often acted! Turn to the prisons and police offices
      of London-nay, look into the very streets themselves. These things pass
      before our eyes, day after day, and hour after hour-they have become such
      matters of course, that they are utterly disregarded. The progress of
      these girls in crime will be as rapid as the flight of a pestilence,
      resembling it too in its baneful influence and wide- spreading infection.
      Step by step, how many wretched females, within the sphere of every man's
      observation, have become involved in a career of vice, frightful to
      contemplate; hopeless at its commencement, loathsome and repulsive in its
      course; friendless, forlorn, and unpitied, at its miserable conclusion!
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other prisoners-boys of ten, as hardened in vice as men of
      fifty-a houseless vagrant, going joyfully to prison as a place of food and
      shelter, handcuffed to a man whose prospects were ruined, character lost,
      and family rendered destitute, by his first offence. Our curiosity,
      however, was satisfied. The first group had left an impression on our mind
      we would gladly have avoided, and would willingly have effaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd dispersed; the vehicle rolled away with its load of guilt and
      misfortune; and we saw no more of the Prisoners' Van.

      CHAPTER I-THE BOARDING-HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs was, beyond all dispute, the most tidy, fidgety, thrifty little
      personage that ever inhaled the smoke of London; and the house of Mrs.
      Tibbs was, decidedly, the neatest in all Great Coram-street. The area and
      the area-steps, and the street-door and the street-door steps, and the
      brass handle, and the door-plate, and the knocker, and the fan- light,
      were all as clean and bright, as indefatigable white-washing, and
      hearth-stoning, and scrubbing and rubbing, could make them. The wonder
      was, that the brass door-plate, with the interesting inscription 'Mrs.
      Tibbs,' had never caught fire from constant friction, so perseveringly was
      it polished. There were meat-safe-looking blinds in the parlour- windows,
      blue and gold curtains in the drawing-room, and spring-roller blinds, as
      Mrs. Tibbs was wont in the pride of her heart to boast, 'all the way up.'
      The bell-lamp in the passage looked as clear as a soap- bubble; you could
      see yourself in all the tables, and French-polish yourself on any one of
      the chairs. The banisters were bees-waxed; and the very stair-wires made
      your eyes wink, they were so glittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs was somewhat short of stature, and Mr. Tibbs was by no means a
      large man. He had, moreover, very short legs, but, by way of
      indemnification, his face was peculiarly long. He was to his wife what the
      0 is in 90-he was of some importance with her-he was nothing without her.
      Mrs. Tibbs was always talking. Mr. Tibbs rarely spoke; but, if it were at
      any time possible to put in a word, when he should have said nothing at
      all, he had that talent. Mrs. Tibbs detested long stories, and Mr. Tibbs
      had one, the conclusion of which had never been heard by his most intimate
      friends. It always began, 'I recollect when I was in the volunteer corps,
      in eighteen hundred and six,'-but, as he spoke very slowly and softly, and
      his better half very quickly and loudly, he rarely got beyond the
      introductory sentence. He was a melancholy specimen of the story-teller.
      He was the wandering Jew of Joe Millerism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tibbs enjoyed a small independence from the pension-list-about 43l.
      15s. 10d. a year. His father, mother, and five interesting scions from the
      same stock, drew a like sum from the revenue of a grateful country, though
      for what particular service was never known. But, as this said
      independence was not quite sufficient to furnish two people with all the
      luxuries of this life, it had occurred to the busy little spouse of Tibbs,
      that the best thing she could do with a legacy of 700l., would be to take
      and furnish a tolerable house-somewhere in that partially- explored tract
      of country which lies between the British Museum, and a remote village
      called Somers-town-for the reception of boarders. Great Coram-street was
      the spot pitched upon. The house had been furnished accordingly; two
      female servants and a boy engaged; and an advertisement inserted in the
      morning papers, informing the public that 'Six individuals would meet with
      all the comforts of a cheerful musical home in a select private family,
      residing within ten minutes' walk of'-everywhere. Answers out of number
      were received, with all sorts of initials; all the letters of the alphabet
      seemed to be seized with a sudden wish to go out boarding and lodging;
      voluminous was the correspondence between Mrs. Tibbs and the applicants;
      and most profound was the secrecy observed. 'E.' didn't like this; 'I.'
      couldn't think of putting up with that; 'I. O. U.' didn't think the terms
      would suit him; and 'G. R.' had never slept in a French bed. The result,
      however, was, that three gentlemen became inmates of Mrs. Tibbs's house,
      on terms which were 'agreeable to all parties.' In went the advertisement
      again, and a lady with her two daughters, proposed to increase-not their
      families, but Mrs. Tibbs's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charming woman, that Mrs. Maplesone!' said Mrs. Tibbs, as she and her
      spouse were sitting by the fire after breakfast; the gentlemen having gone
      out on their several avocations. 'Charming woman, indeed!' repeated little
      Mrs. Tibbs, more by way of soliloquy than anything else, for she never
      thought of consulting her husband. 'And the two daughters are delightful.
      We must have some fish to-day; they'll join us at dinner for the first
      time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tibbs placed the poker at right angles with the fire shovel, and
      essayed to speak, but recollected he had nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The young ladies,' continued Mrs. T., 'have kindly volunteered to bring
      their own piano.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibbs thought of the volunteer story, but did not venture it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bright thought struck him-
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's very likely-' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray don't lean your head against the paper,' interrupted Mrs. Tibbs;
      'and don't put your feet on the steel fender; that's worse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibbs took his head from the paper, and his feet from the fender, and
      proceeded. 'It's very likely one of the young ladies may set her cap at
      young Mr. Simpson, and you know a marriage-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A what!' shrieked Mrs. Tibbs. Tibbs modestly repeated his former
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg you won't mention such a thing,' said Mrs. T. 'A marriage, indeed
      to rob me of my boarders-no, not for the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibbs thought in his own mind that the event was by no means unlikely,
      but, as he never argued with his wife, he put a stop to the dialogue, by
      observing it was 'time to go to business.' He always went out at ten
      o'clock in the morning, and returned at five in the afternoon, with an
      exceedingly dirty face, and smelling mouldy. Nobody knew what he was, or
      where he went; but Mrs. Tibbs used to say with an air of great importance,
      that he was engaged in the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miss Maplesones and their accomplished parent arrived in the course of
      the afternoon in a hackney-coach, and accompanied by a most astonishing
      number of packages. Trunks, bonnet-boxes, muff-boxes and parasols,
      guitar-cases, and parcels of all imaginable shapes, done up in brown
      paper, and fastened with pins, filled the passage. Then, there was such a
      running up and down with the luggage, such scampering for warm water for
      the ladies to wash in, and such a bustle, and confusion, and heating of
      servants, and curling-irons, as had never been known in Great Coram-street
      before. Little Mrs. Tibbs was quite in her element, bustling about,
      talking incessantly, and distributing towels and soap, like a head nurse
      in a hospital. The house was not restored to its usual state of quiet
      repose, until the ladies were safely shut up in their respective bedrooms,
      engaged in the important occupation of dressing for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are these gals 'andsome?' inquired Mr. Simpson of Mr. Septimus Hicks,
      another of the boarders, as they were amusing themselves in the drawing-
      room, before dinner, by lolling on sofas, and contemplating their pumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't know,' replied Mr. Septimus Hicks, who was a tallish, white-faced
      young man, with spectacles, and a black ribbon round his neck instead of a
      neckerchief-a most interesting person; a poetical walker of the hospitals,
      and a 'very talented young man.' He was fond of 'lugging' into
      conversation all sorts of quotations from Don Juan, without fettering
      himself by the propriety of their application; in which particular he was
      remarkably independent. The other, Mr. Simpson, was one of those young
      men, who are in society what walking gentlemen are on the stage, only
      infinitely worse skilled in his vocation than the most indifferent artist.
      He was as empty-headed as the great bell of St. Paul's; always dressed
      according to the caricatures published in the monthly fashion; and spelt
      Character with a K.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw a devilish number of parcels in the passage when I came home,'
      simpered Mr. Simpson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Materials for the toilet, no doubt,' rejoined the Don Juan reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      -'Much linen, lace, and several pair Of stockings, slippers, brushes,
      combs, complete; With other articles of ladies fair, To keep them
      beautiful, or leave them neat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that from Milton?' inquired Mr. Simpson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-from Byron,' returned Mr. Hicks, with a look of contempt. He was quite
      sure of his author, because he had never read any other. 'Hush! Here come
      the gals,' and they both commenced talking in a very loud key.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Maplesone and the Miss Maplesones, Mr. Hicks. Mr. Hicks-Mrs.
      Maplesone and the Miss Maplesones,' said Mrs. Tibbs, with a very red face,
      for she had been superintending the cooking operations below stairs, and
      looked like a wax doll on a sunny day. 'Mr. Simpson, I beg your pardon-Mr.
      Simpson-Mrs. Maplesone and the Miss Maplesones'-and vice versAc. The
      gentlemen immediately began to slide about with much politeness, and to
      look as if they wished their arms had been legs, so little did they know
      what to do with them. The ladies smiled, curtseyed, and glided into
      chairs, and dived for dropped pocket- handkerchiefs: the gentlemen leant
      against two of the curtain-pegs; Mrs. Tibbs went through an admirable bit
      of serious pantomime with a servant who had come up to ask some question
      about the fish-sauce; and then the two young ladies looked at each other;
      and everybody else appeared to discover something very attractive in the
      pattern of the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Julia, my love,' said Mrs. Maplesone to her youngest daughter, in a tone
      loud enough for the remainder of the company to hear-'Julia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Ma.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't stoop.'-This was said for the purpose of directing general
      attention to Miss Julia's figure, which was undeniable. Everybody looked
      at her, accordingly, and there was another pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We had the most uncivil hackney-coachman to-day, you can imagine,' said
      Mrs. Maplesone to Mrs. Tibbs, in a confidential tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me!' replied the hostess, with an air of great commiseration. She
      couldn't say more, for the servant again appeared at the door, and
      commenced telegraphing most earnestly to her 'Missis.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think hackney-coachmen generally are uncivil,' said Mr. Hicks in his
      most insinuating tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Positively I think they are,' replied Mrs. Maplesone, as if the idea had
      never struck her before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And cabmen, too,' said Mr. Simpson. This remark was a failure, for no one
      intimated, by word or sign, the slightest knowledge of the manners and
      customs of cabmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Robinson, what do you want?' said Mrs. Tibbs to the servant, who, by way
      of making her presence known to her mistress, had been giving sundry hems
      and sniffs outside the door during the preceding five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please, ma'am, master wants his clean things,' replied the servant, taken
      off her guard. The two young men turned their faces to the window, and
      'went off' like a couple of bottles of ginger-beer; the ladies put their
      handkerchiefs to their mouths; and little Mrs. Tibbs bustled out of the
      room to give Tibbs his clean linen,-and the servant warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Calton, the remaining boarder, shortly afterwards made his appearance,
      and proved a surprising promoter of the conversation. Mr. Calton was a
      superannuated beau-an old boy. He used to say of himself that although his
      features were not regularly handsome, they were striking. They certainly
      were. It was impossible to look at his face without being reminded of a
      chubby street-door knocker, half-lion half- monkey; and the comparison
      might be extended to his whole character and conversation. He had stood
      still, while everything else had been moving. He never originated a
      conversation, or started an idea; but if any commonplace topic were
      broached, or, to pursue the comparison, if anybody lifted him up, he would
      hammer away with surprising rapidity. He had the tic-douloureux
      occasionally, and then he might be said to be muffled, because he did not
      make quite as much noise as at other times, when he would go on prosing,
      rat-tat-tat the same thing over and over again. He had never been married;
      but he was still on the look-out for a wife with money. He had a life
      interest worth about 300l. a year-he was exceedingly vain, and
      inordinately selfish. He had acquired the reputation of being the very
      pink of politeness, and he walked round the park, and up Regent-street,
      every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This respectable personage had made up his mind to render himself
      exceedingly agreeable to Mrs. Maplesone-indeed, the desire of being as
      amiable as possible extended itself to the whole party; Mrs. Tibbs having
      considered it an admirable little bit of management to represent to the
      gentlemen that she had some reason to believe the ladies were fortunes,
      and to hint to the ladies, that all the gentlemen were 'eligible.' A
      little flirtation, she thought, might keep her house full, without leading
      to any other result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maplesone was an enterprising widow of about fifty: shrewd, scheming,
      and good-looking. She was amiably anxious on behalf of her daughters; in
      proof whereof she used to remark, that she would have no objection to
      marry again, if it would benefit her dear girls-she could have no other
      motive. The 'dear girls' themselves were not at all insensible to the
      merits of 'a good establishment.' One of them was twenty-five; the other,
      three years younger. They had been at different watering-places, for four
      seasons; they had gambled at libraries, read books in balconies, sold at
      fancy fairs, danced at assemblies, talked sentiment-in short, they had
      done all that industrious girls could do-but, as yet, to no purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a magnificent dresser Mr. Simpson is!' whispered Matilda Maplesone
      to her sister Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Splendid!' returned the youngest. The magnificent individual alluded to
      wore a maroon-coloured dress-coat, with a velvet collar and cuffs of the
      same tint-very like that which usually invests the form of the
      distinguished unknown who condescends to play the 'swell' in the pantomime
      at 'Richardson's Show.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What whiskers!' said Miss Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charming!' responded her sister; 'and what hair!' His hair was like a
      wig, and distinguished by that insinuating wave which graces the shining
      locks of those chef-d'oeuvres of art surmounting the waxen images in
      Bartellot's window in Regent-street; his whiskers meeting beneath his
      chin, seemed strings wherewith to tie it on, ere science had rendered them
      unnecessary by her patent invisible springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dinner's on the table, ma'am, if you please,' said the boy, who now
      appeared for the first time, in a revived black coat of his master's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! Mr. Calton, will you lead Mrs. Maplesone?-Thank you.' Mr. Simpson
      offered his arm to Miss Julia; Mr. Septimus Hicks escorted the lovely
      Matilda; and the procession proceeded to the dining-room. Mr. Tibbs was
      introduced, and Mr. Tibbs bobbed up and down to the three ladies like a
      figure in a Dutch clock, with a powerful spring in the middle of his body,
      and then dived rapidly into his seat at the bottom of the table, delighted
      to screen himself behind a soup-tureen, which he could just see over, and
      that was all. The boarders were seated, a lady and gentleman alternately,
      like the layers of bread and meat in a plate of sandwiches; and then Mrs.
      Tibbs directed James to take off the covers. Salmon, lobster-sauce,
      giblet-soup, and the usual accompaniments were discovered: potatoes like
      petrifactions, and bits of toasted bread, the shape and size of blank
      dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Soup for Mrs. Maplesone, my dear,' said the bustling Mrs. Tibbs. She
      always called her husband 'my dear' before company. Tibbs, who had been
      eating his bread, and calculating how long it would be before he should
      get any fish, helped the soup in a hurry, made a small island on the
      table-cloth, and put his glass upon it, to hide it from his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Julia, shall I assist you to some fish?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you please-very little-oh! plenty, thank you' (a bit about the size of
      a walnut put upon the plate).
    </p>
    <p>
      'Julia is a very little eater,' said Mrs. Maplesone to Mr. Calton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knocker gave a single rap. He was busy eating the fish with his eyes:
      so he only ejaculated, 'Ah!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear,' said Mrs. Tibbs to her spouse after every one else had been
      helped, 'what do you take?' The inquiry was accompanied with a look
      intimating that he mustn't say fish, because there was not much left.
      Tibbs thought the frown referred to the island on the table-cloth; he
      therefore coolly replied, 'Why-I'll take a little-fish, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you say fish, my dear?' (another frown).
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, dear,' replied the villain, with an expression of acute hunger
      depicted in his countenance. The tears almost started to Mrs. Tibbs's
      eyes, as she helped her 'wretch of a husband,' as she inwardly called him,
      to the last eatable bit of salmon on the dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      'James, take this to your master, and take away your master's knife.' This
      was deliberate revenge, as Tibbs never could eat fish without one. He was,
      however, constrained to chase small particles of salmon round and round
      his plate with a piece of bread and a fork, the number of successful
      attempts being about one in seventeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take away, James,' said Mrs. Tibbs, as Tibbs swallowed the fourth
      mouthful-and away went the plates like lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll take a bit of bread, James,' said the poor 'master of the house,'
      more hungry than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind your master now, James,' said Mrs. Tibbs, 'see about the
      meat.' This was conveyed in the tone in which ladies usually give
      admonitions to servants in company, that is to say, a low one; but which,
      like a stage whisper, from its peculiar emphasis, is most distinctly heard
      by everybody present.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause ensued, before the table was replenished-a sort of parenthesis in
      which Mr. Simpson, Mr. Calton, and Mr. Hicks, produced respectively a
      bottle of sauterne, bucellas, and sherry, and took wine with
      everybody-except Tibbs. No one ever thought of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the fish and an intimated sirloin, there was a prolonged interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was an opportunity for Mr. Hicks. He could not resist the singularly
      appropriate quotation-
    </p>
    <p>
      'But beef is rare within these oxless isles; Goats' flesh there is, no
      doubt, and kid, and mutton, And when a holiday upon them smiles, A joint
      upon their barbarous spits they put on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very ungentlemanly behaviour,' thought little Mrs. Tibbs, 'to talk in
      that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah,' said Mr. Calton, filling his glass. 'Tom Moore is my poet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And mine,' said Mrs. Maplesone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And mine,' said Miss Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And mine,' added Mr. Simpson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look at his compositions,' resumed the knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure,' said Simpson, with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look at Don Juan,' replied Mr. Septimus Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Julia's letter,' suggested Miss Matilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can anything be grander than the Fire Worshippers?' inquired Miss Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure,' said Simpson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or Paradise and the Peri,' said the old beau.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; or Paradise and the Peer,' repeated Simpson, who thought he was
      getting through it capitally.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's all very well,' replied Mr. Septimus Hicks, who, as we have before
      hinted, never had read anything but Don Juan. 'Where will you find
      anything finer than the description of the siege, at the commencement of
      the seventh canto?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Talking of a siege,' said Tibbs, with a mouthful of bread-'when I was in
      the volunteer corps, in eighteen hundred and six, our commanding officer
      was Sir Charles Rampart; and one day, when we were exercising on the
      ground on which the London University now stands, he says, says he, Tibbs
      (calling me from the ranks), Tibbs-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell your master, James,' interrupted Mrs. Tibbs, in an awfully distinct
      tone, 'tell your master if he won't carve those fowls, to send them to
      me.' The discomfited volunteer instantly set to work, and carved the fowls
      almost as expeditiously as his wife operated on the haunch of mutton.
      Whether he ever finished the story is not known but, if he did, nobody
      heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the ice was now broken, and the new inmates more at home, every member
      of the company felt more at ease. Tibbs himself most certainly did,
      because he went to sleep immediately after dinner. Mr. Hicks and the
      ladies discoursed most eloquently about poetry, and the theatres, and Lord
      Chesterfield's Letters; and Mr. Calton followed up what everybody said,
      with continuous double knocks. Mrs. Tibbs highly approved of every
      observation that fell from Mrs. Maplesone; and as Mr. Simpson sat with a
      smile upon his face and said 'Yes,' or 'Certainly,' at intervals of about
      four minutes each, he received full credit for understanding what was
      going forward. The gentlemen rejoined the ladies in the drawing-room very
      shortly after they had left the dining-parlour. Mrs. Maplesone and Mr.
      Calton played cribbage, and the 'young people' amused themselves with
      music and conversation. The Miss Maplesones sang the most fascinating
      duets, and accompanied themselves on guitars, ornamented with bits of
      ethereal blue ribbon. Mr. Simpson put on a pink waistcoat, and said he was
      in raptures; and Mr. Hicks felt in the seventh heaven of poetry or the
      seventh canto of Don Juan-it was the same thing to him. Mrs. Tibbs was
      quite charmed with the newcomers; and Mr. Tibbs spent the evening in his
      usual way-he went to sleep, and woke up, and went to sleep again, and woke
      at supper-time.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We are not about to adopt the licence of novel-writers, and to let 'years
      roll on;' but we will take the liberty of requesting the reader to suppose
      that six months have elapsed, since the dinner we have described, and that
      Mrs. Tibbs's boarders have, during that period, sang, and danced, and gone
      to theatres and exhibitions, together, as ladies and gentlemen, wherever
      they board, often do. And we will beg them, the period we have mentioned
      having elapsed, to imagine farther, that Mr. Septimus Hicks received, in
      his own bedroom (a front attic), at an early hour one morning, a note from
      Mr. Calton, requesting the favour of seeing him, as soon as convenient to
      himself, in his (Calton's) dressing-room on the second-floor back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell Mr. Calton I'll come down directly,' said Mr. Septimus to the boy.
      'Stop-is Mr. Calton unwell?' inquired this excited walker of hospitals, as
      he put on a bed-furniture-looking dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not as I knows on, sir,' replied the boy. ' Please, sir, he looked rather
      rum, as it might be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, that's no proof of his being ill,' returned Hicks, unconsciously.
      'Very well: I'll be down directly.' Downstairs ran the boy with the
      message, and down went the excited Hicks himself, almost as soon as the
      message was delivered. 'Tap, tap.' 'Come in.'-Door opens, and discovers
      Mr. Calton sitting in an easy chair. Mutual shakes of the hand exchanged,
      and Mr. Septimus Hicks motioned to a seat. A short pause. Mr. Hicks
      coughed, and Mr. Calton took a pinch of snuff. It was one of those
      interviews where neither party knows what to say. Mr. Septimus Hicks broke
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I received a note-' he said, very tremulously, in a voice like a Punch
      with a cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' returned the other, 'you did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exactly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although this dialogue must have been satisfactory, both gentlemen
      felt there was something more important to be said; therefore they did as
      most men in such a situation would have done-they looked at the table with
      a determined aspect. The conversation had been opened, however, and Mr.
      Calton had made up his mind to continue it with a regular double knock. He
      always spoke very pompously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hicks,' said he, 'I have sent for you, in consequence of certain
      arrangements which are pending in this house, connected with a marriage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With a marriage!' gasped Hicks, compared with whose expression of
      countenance, Hamlet's, when he sees his father's ghost, is pleasing and
      composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'With a marriage,' returned the knocker. 'I have sent for you to prove the
      great confidence I can repose in you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And will you betray me?' eagerly inquired Hicks, who in his alarm had
      even forgotten to quote.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I betray you! Won't you betray me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never: no one shall know, to my dying day, that you had a hand in the
      business,' responded the agitated Hicks, with an inflamed countenance, and
      his hair standing on end as if he were on the stool of an electrifying
      machine in full operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'People must know that, some time or other-within a year, I imagine,' said
      Mr. Calton, with an air of great self-complacency. 'We may have a family.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We!-That won't affect you, surely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The devil it won't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! how can it?' said the bewildered Hicks. Calton was too much inwrapped
      in the contemplation of his happiness to see the equivoque between Hicks
      and himself; and threw himself back in his chair. 'Oh, Matilda!' sighed
      the antique beau, in a lack-a-daisical voice, and applying his right hand
      a little to the left of the fourth button of his waistcoat, counting from
      the bottom. 'Oh, Matilda!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What Matilda?' inquired Hicks, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Matilda Maplesone,' responded the other, doing the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I marry her to-morrow morning,' said Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's false,' rejoined his companion: 'I marry her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You marry her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I marry her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You marry Matilda Maplesone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Matilda Maplesone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Maplesone marry you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Maplesone! No; Mrs. Maplesone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good Heaven!' said Hicks, falling into his chair: 'You marry the mother,
      and I the daughter!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most extraordinary circumstance!' replied Mr. Calton, 'and rather
      inconvenient too; for the fact is, that owing to Matilda's wishing to keep
      her intention secret from her daughters until the ceremony had taken
      place, she doesn't like applying to any of her friends to give her away. I
      entertain an objection to making the affair known to my acquaintance just
      now; and the consequence is, that I sent to you to know whether you'd
      oblige me by acting as father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should have been most happy, I assure you,' said Hicks, in a tone of
      condolence; 'but, you see, I shall be acting as bridegroom. One character
      is frequently a consequence of the other; but it is not usual to act in
      both at the same time. There's Simpson-I have no doubt he'll do it for
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like to ask him,' replied Calton, 'he's such a donkey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Septimus Hicks looked up at the ceiling, and down at the floor; at
      last an idea struck him. 'Let the man of the house, Tibbs, be the father,'
      he suggested; and then he quoted, as peculiarly applicable to Tibbs and
      the pair-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh Powers of Heaven! what dark eyes meets she there? 'Tis-'tis her
      father's-fixed upon the pair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The idea has struck me already,' said Mr. Calton: 'but, you see, Matilda,
      for what reason I know not, is very anxious that Mrs. Tibbs should know
      nothing about it, till it's all over. It's a natural delicacy, after all,
      you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's the best-natured little man in existence, if you manage him
      properly,' said Mr. Septimus Hicks. 'Tell him not to mention it to his
      wife, and assure him she won't mind it, and he'll do it directly. My
      marriage is to be a secret one, on account of the mother and my father;
      therefore he must be enjoined to secrecy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A small double knock, like a presumptuous single one, was that instant
      heard at the street-door. It was Tibbs; it could be no one else; for no
      one else occupied five minutes in rubbing his shoes. He had been out to
      pay the baker's bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Tibbs,' called Mr. Calton in a very bland tone, looking over the
      banisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir!' replied he of the dirty face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you have the kindness to step up-stairs for a moment?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, sir,' said Tibbs, delighted to be taken notice of. The
      bedroom-door was carefully closed, and Tibbs, having put his hat on the
      floor (as most timid men do), and been accommodated with a seat, looked as
      astounded as if he were suddenly summoned before the familiars of the
      Inquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A rather unpleasant occurrence, Mr. Tibbs,' said Calton, in a very
      portentous manner, 'obliges me to consult you, and to beg you will not
      communicate what I am about to say, to your wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibbs acquiesced, wondering in his own mind what the deuce the other could
      have done, and imagining that at least he must have broken the best
      decanters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Calton resumed; 'I am placed, Mr. Tibbs, in rather an unpleasant
      situation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibbs looked at Mr. Septimus Hicks, as if he thought Mr. H.'s being in the
      immediate vicinity of his fellow-boarder might constitute the
      unpleasantness of his situation; but as he did not exactly know what to
      say, he merely ejaculated the monosyllable 'Lor!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' continued the knocker, 'let me beg you will exhibit no
      manifestations of surprise, which may be overheard by the domestics, when
      I tell you-command your feelings of astonishment-that two inmates of this
      house intend to be married to-morrow morning.' And he drew back his chair,
      several feet, to perceive the effect of the unlooked-for announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Tibbs had rushed from the room, staggered down-stairs, and fainted in
      the passage-if he had instantaneously jumped out of the window into the
      mews behind the house, in an agony of surprise-his behaviour would have
      been much less inexplicable to Mr. Calton than it was, when he put his
      hands into his inexpressible-pockets, and said with a half-chuckle, 'Just
      so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not surprised, Mr. Tibbs?' inquired Mr. Calton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless you, no, sir,' returned Tibbs; 'after all, its very natural. When
      two young people get together, you know-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, certainly,' said Calton, with an indescribable air of self-
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't think it's at all an out-of-the-way affair then?' asked Mr.
      Septimus Hicks, who had watched the countenance of Tibbs in mute
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir,' replied Tibbs; 'I was just the same at his age.' He actually
      smiled when he said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How devilish well I must carry my years!' thought the delighted old beau,
      knowing he was at least ten years older than Tibbs at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, to come to the point at once,' he continued, 'I have to ask
      you whether you will object to act as father on the occasion?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not,' replied Tibbs; still without evincing an atom of
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Decidedly not,' reiterated Tibbs, still as calm as a pot of porter with
      the head off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Calton seized the hand of the petticoat-governed little man, and vowed
      eternal friendship from that hour. Hicks, who was all admiration and
      surprise, did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, confess,' asked Mr. Calton of Tibbs, as he picked up his hat, 'were
      you not a little surprised?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I b'lieve you!' replied that illustrious person, holding up one hand; 'I
      b'lieve you! When I first heard of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So sudden,' said Septimus Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So strange to ask me, you know,' said Tibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So odd altogether!' said the superannuated love-maker; and then all three
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say,' said Tibbs, shutting the door which he had previously opened, and
      giving full vent to a hitherto corked-up giggle, 'what bothers me is, what
      will his father say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Septimus Hicks looked at Mr. Calton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; but the best of it is,' said the latter, giggling in his turn, 'I
      haven't got a father-he! he! he!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You haven't got a father. No; but he has,' said Tibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who has?' inquired Septimus Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Him, who? Do you know my secret? Do you mean me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You! No; you know who I mean,' returned Tibbs with a knowing wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For Heaven's sake, whom do you mean?' inquired Mr. Calton, who, like
      Septimus Hicks, was all but out of his senses at the strange confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why Mr. Simpson, of course,' replied Tibbs; 'who else could I mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see it all,' said the Byron-quoter; 'Simpson marries Julia Maplesone
      to-morrow morning!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Undoubtedly,' replied Tibbs, thoroughly satisfied, 'of course he does.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It would require the pencil of Hogarth to illustrate-our feeble pen is
      inadequate to describe-the expression which the countenances of Mr. Calton
      and Mr. Septimus Hicks respectively assumed, at this unexpected
      announcement. Equally impossible is it to describe, although perhaps it is
      easier for our lady readers to imagine, what arts the three ladies could
      have used, so completely to entangle their separate partners. Whatever
      they were, however, they were successful. The mother was perfectly aware
      of the intended marriage of both daughters; and the young ladies were
      equally acquainted with the intention of their estimable parent. They
      agreed, however, that it would have a much better appearance if each
      feigned ignorance of the other's engagement; and it was equally desirable
      that all the marriages should take place on the same day, to prevent the
      discovery of one clandestine alliance, operating prejudicially on the
      others. Hence, the mystification of Mr. Calton and Mr. Septimus Hicks, and
      the pre-engagement of the unwary Tibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning, Mr. Septimus Hicks was united to Miss Matilda
      Maplesone. Mr. Simpson also entered into a 'holy alliance' with Miss
      Julia; Tibbs acting as father, 'his first appearance in that character.'
      Mr. Calton, not being quite so eager as the two young men, was rather
      struck by the double discovery; and as he had found some difficulty in
      getting any one to give the lady away, it occurred to him that the best
      mode of obviating the inconvenience would be not to take her at all. The
      lady, however, 'appealed,' as her counsel said on the trial of the cause,
      Maplesone v. Calton, for a breach of promise, 'with a broken heart, to the
      outraged laws of her country.' She recovered damages to the amount of
      1,000l. which the unfortunate knocker was compelled to pay. Mr. Septimus
      Hicks having walked the hospitals, took it into his head to walk off
      altogether. His injured wife is at present residing with her mother at
      Boulogne. Mr. Simpson, having the misfortune to lose his wife six weeks
      after marriage (by her eloping with an officer during his temporary
      sojourn in the Fleet Prison, in consequence of his inability to discharge
      her little mantua-maker's bill), and being disinherited by his father, who
      died soon afterwards, was fortunate enough to obtain a permanent
      engagement at a fashionable haircutter's; hairdressing being a science to
      which he had frequently directed his attention. In this situation he had
      necessarily many opportunities of making himself acquainted with the
      habits, and style of thinking, of the exclusive portion of the nobility of
      this kingdom. To this fortunate circumstance are we indebted for the
      production of those brilliant efforts of genius, his fashionable novels,
      which so long as good taste, unsullied by exaggeration, cant, and
      quackery, continues to exist, cannot fail to instruct and amuse the
      thinking portion of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only remains to add, that this complication of disorders completely
      deprived poor Mrs. Tibbs of all her inmates, except the one whom she could
      have best spared-her husband. That wretched little man returned home, on
      the day of the wedding, in a state of partial intoxication; and, under the
      influence of wine, excitement, and despair, actually dared to brave the
      anger of his wife. Since that ill-fated hour he has constantly taken his
      meals in the kitchen, to which apartment, it is understood, his witticisms
      will be in future confined: a turn-up bedstead having been conveyed there
      by Mrs. Tibbs's order for his exclusive accommodation. It is possible that
      he will be enabled to finish, in that seclusion, his story of the
      volunteers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE SECOND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Well!' said little Mrs. Tibbs to herself, as she sat in the front parlour
      of the Coram-street mansion one morning, mending a piece of stair-carpet
      off the first Landings;-'Things have not turned out so badly, either, and
      if I only get a favourable answer to the advertisement, we shall be full
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs resumed her occupation of making worsted lattice-work in the
      carpet, anxiously listening to the twopenny postman, who was hammering his
      way down the street, at the rate of a penny a knock. The house was as
      quiet as possible. There was only one low sound to be heard-it was the
      unhappy Tibbs cleaning the gentlemen's boots in the back kitchen, and
      accompanying himself with a buzzing noise, in wretched mockery of humming
      a tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postman drew near the house. He paused-so did Mrs. Tibbs. A knock-a
      bustle-a letter-post-paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'T. I. presents compt. to I. T. and T. I. begs To say that i see the
      advertisement And she will Do Herself the pleasure of calling On you at 12
      o'clock to-morrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'T. I. as To apologise to I. T. for the shortness Of the notice But i hope
      it will not unconvenience you.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I remain yours Truly 'Wednesday evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Mrs. Tibbs perused the document, over and over again; and the more
      she read it, the more was she confused by the mixture of the first and
      third person; the substitution of the 'i' for the 'T. I.;' and the
      transition from the 'I. T.' to the 'You.' The writing looked like a skein
      of thread in a tangle, and the note was ingeniously folded into a perfect
      square, with the direction squeezed up into the right-hand corner, as if
      it were ashamed of itself. The back of the epistle was pleasingly
      ornamented with a large red wafer, which, with the addition of divers
      ink-stains, bore a marvellous resemblance to a black beetle trodden upon.
      One thing, however, was perfectly clear to the perplexed Mrs. Tibbs.
      Somebody was to call at twelve. The drawing-room was forthwith dusted for
      the third time that morning; three or four chairs were pulled out of their
      places, and a corresponding number of books carefully upset, in order that
      there might be a due absence of formality. Down went the piece of
      stair-carpet before noticed, and up ran Mrs. Tibbs 'to make herself tidy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock of New Saint Pancras Church struck twelve, and the Foundling,
      with laudable politeness, did the same ten minutes afterwards, Saint
      something else struck the quarter, and then there arrived a single lady
      with a double knock, in a pelisse the colour of the interior of a damson
      pie; a bonnet of the same, with a regular conservatory of artificial
      flowers; a white veil, and a green parasol, with a cobweb border.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor (who was very fat and red-faced) was shown into the drawing-
      room; Mrs. Tibbs presented herself, and the negotiation commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I called in consequence of an advertisement,' said the stranger, in a
      voice as if she had been playing a set of Pan's pipes for a fortnight
      without leaving off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes!' said Mrs. Tibbs, rubbing her hands very slowly, and looking the
      applicant full in the face-two things she always did on such occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Money isn't no object whatever to me,' said the lady, 'so much as living
      in a state of retirement and obtrusion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs, as a matter of course, acquiesced in such an exceedingly
      natural desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am constantly attended by a medical man,' resumed the pelisse wearer;
      'I have been a shocking unitarian for some time-I, indeed, have had very
      little peace since the death of Mr. Bloss.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs looked at the relict of the departed Bloss, and thought he must
      have had very little peace in his time. Of course she could not say so; so
      she looked very sympathising.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be a good deal of trouble to you,' said Mrs. Bloss; 'but, for
      that trouble I am willing to pay. I am going through a course of treatment
      which renders attention necessary. I have one mutton-chop in bed at
      half-past eight, and another at ten, every morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs, as in duty bound, expressed the pity she felt for anybody
      placed in such a distressing situation; and the carnivorous Mrs. Bloss
      proceeded to arrange the various preliminaries with wonderful despatch.
      'Now mind,' said that lady, after terms were arranged; 'I am to have the
      second-floor front, for my bed-room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you'll find room for my little servant Agnes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I can have one of the cellars in the area for my bottled porter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With the greatest pleasure;-James shall get it ready for you by
      Saturday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I'll join the company at the breakfast-table on Sunday morning,' said
      Mrs. Bloss. 'I shall get up on purpose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' returned Mrs. Tibbs, in her most amiable tone; for
      satisfactory references had 'been given and required,' and it was quite
      certain that the new-comer had plenty of money. 'It's rather singular,'
      continued Mrs. Tibbs, with what was meant for a most bewitching smile,
      'that we have a gentleman now with us, who is in a very delicate state of
      health-a Mr. Gobler.-His apartment is the back drawing-room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The next room?' inquired Mrs. Bloss.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The next room,' repeated the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How very promiscuous!' ejaculated the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He hardly ever gets up,' said Mrs. Tibbs in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lor!' cried Mrs. Bloss, in an equally low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And when he is up,' said Mrs. Tibbs, 'we never can persuade him to go to
      bed again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me!' said the astonished Mrs. Bloss, drawing her chair nearer Mrs.
      Tibbs. 'What is his complaint?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, the fact is,' replied Mrs. Tibbs, with a most communicative air, 'he
      has no stomach whatever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No what?' inquired Mrs. Bloss, with a look of the most indescribable
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No stomach,' repeated Mrs. Tibbs, with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord bless us! what an extraordinary case!' gasped Mrs. Bloss, as if she
      understood the communication in its literal sense, and was astonished at a
      gentleman without a stomach finding it necessary to board anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When I say he has no stomach,' explained the chatty little Mrs. Tibbs, 'I
      mean that his digestion is so much impaired, and his interior so deranged,
      that his stomach is not of the least use to him;-in fact, it's an
      inconvenience.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never heard such a case in my life!' exclaimed Mrs. Bloss. 'Why, he's
      worse than I am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes!' replied Mrs. Tibbs;-'certainly.' She said this with great
      confidence, for the damson pelisse suggested that Mrs. Bloss, at all
      events, was not suffering under Mr. Gobler's complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have quite incited my curiosity,' said Mrs. Bloss, as she rose to
      depart. 'How I long to see him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He generally comes down, once a week,' replied Mrs. Tibbs; 'I dare say
      you'll see him on Sunday.' With this consolatory promise Mrs. Bloss was
      obliged to be contented. She accordingly walked slowly down the stairs,
      detailing her complaints all the way; and Mrs. Tibbs followed her,
      uttering an exclamation of compassion at every step. James (who looked
      very gritty, for he was cleaning the knives) fell up the kitchen-stairs,
      and opened the street-door; and, after mutual farewells, Mrs. Bloss slowly
      departed, down the shady side of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is almost superfluous to say, that the lady whom we have just shown out
      at the street-door (and whom the two female servants are now inspecting
      from the second-floor windows) was exceedingly vulgar, ignorant, and
      selfish. Her deceased better-half had been an eminent cork-cutter, in
      which capacity he had amassed a decent fortune. He had no relative but his
      nephew, and no friend but his cook. The former had the insolence one
      morning to ask for the loan of fifteen pounds; and, by way of retaliation,
      he married the latter next day; he made a will immediately afterwards,
      containing a burst of honest indignation against his nephew (who supported
      himself and two sisters on 100l. a year), and a bequest of his whole
      property to his wife. He felt ill after breakfast, and died after dinner.
      There is a mantelpiece-looking tablet in a civic parish church, setting
      forth his virtues, and deploring his loss. He never dishonoured a bill, or
      gave away a halfpenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relict and sole executrix of this noble-minded man was an odd mixture
      of shrewdness and simplicity, liberality and meanness. Bred up as she had
      been, she knew no mode of living so agreeable as a boarding- house: and
      having nothing to do, and nothing to wish for, she naturally imagined she
      must be ill-an impression which was most assiduously promoted by her
      medical attendant, Dr. Wosky, and her handmaid Agnes: both of whom,
      doubtless for good reasons, encouraged all her extravagant notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the catastrophe recorded in the last chapter, Mrs. Tibbs had been
      very shy of young-lady boarders. Her present inmates were all lords of the
      creation, and she availed herself of the opportunity of their assemblage
      at the dinner-table, to announce the expected arrival of Mrs. Bloss. The
      gentlemen received the communication with stoical indifference, and Mrs.
      Tibbs devoted all her energies to prepare for the reception of the
      valetudinarian. The second-floor front was scrubbed, and washed, and
      flannelled, till the wet went through to the drawing- room ceiling. Clean
      white counterpanes, and curtains, and napkins, water-bottles as clear as
      crystal, blue jugs, and mahogany furniture, added to the splendour, and
      increased the comfort, of the apartment. The warming-pan was in constant
      requisition, and a fire lighted in the room every day. The chattels of
      Mrs. Bloss were forwarded by instalments. First, there came a large hamper
      of Guinness's stout, and an umbrella; then, a train of trunks; then, a
      pair of clogs and a bandbox; then, an easy chair with an air-cushion;
      then, a variety of suspicious-looking packages; and-'though last not
      least'-Mrs. Bloss and Agnes: the latter in a cherry-coloured merino dress,
      open-work stockings, and shoes with sandals: like a disguised Columbine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The installation of the Duke of Wellington, as Chancellor of the
      University of Oxford, was nothing, in point of bustle and turmoil, to the
      installation of Mrs. Bloss in her new quarters. True, there was no bright
      doctor of civil law to deliver a classical address on the occasion; but
      there were several other old women present, who spoke quite as much to the
      purpose, and understood themselves equally well. The chop-eater was so
      fatigued with the process of removal that she declined leaving her room
      until the following morning; so a mutton-chop, pickle, a pill, a pint
      bottle of stout, and other medicines, were carried up-stairs for her
      consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, what do you think, ma'am?' inquired the inquisitive Agnes of her
      mistress, after they had been in the house some three hours; 'what do you
      think, ma'am? the lady of the house is married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Married!' said Mrs. Bloss, taking the pill and a draught of
      Guinness-'married! Unpossible!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is indeed, ma'am,' returned the Columbine; 'and her husband, ma'am,
      lives-he-he-he-lives in the kitchen, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the kitchen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am: and he-he-he-the housemaid says, he never goes into the
      parlour except on Sundays; and that Ms. Tibbs makes him clean the
      gentlemen's boots; and that he cleans the windows, too, sometimes; and
      that one morning early, when he was in the front balcony cleaning the
      drawing-room windows, he called out to a gentleman on the opposite side of
      the way, who used to live here-"Ah! Mr. Calton, sir, how are you?"' Here
      the attendant laughed till Mrs. Bloss was in serious apprehension of her
      chuckling herself into a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I never!' said Mrs. Bloss.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And please, ma'am, the servants gives him gin-and-water sometimes;
      and then he cries, and says he hates his wife and the boarders, and wants
      to tickle them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tickle the boarders!' exclaimed Mrs. Bloss, seriously alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, ma'am, not the boarders, the servants.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, is that all!' said Mrs. Bloss, quite satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He wanted to kiss me as I came up the kitchen-stairs, just now,' said
      Agnes, indignantly; 'but I gave it him-a little wretch!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This intelligence was but too true. A long course of snubbing and neglect;
      his days spent in the kitchen, and his nights in the turn-up bedstead, had
      completely broken the little spirit that the unfortunate volunteer had
      ever possessed. He had no one to whom he could detail his injuries but the
      servants, and they were almost of necessity his chosen confidants. It is
      no less strange than true, however, that the little weaknesses which he
      had incurred, most probably during his military career, seemed to increase
      as his comforts diminished. He was actually a sort of journeyman Giovanni
      of the basement story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, being Sunday, breakfast was laid in the front parlour at
      ten o'clock. Nine was the usual time, but the family always breakfasted an
      hour later on sabbath. Tibbs enrobed himself in his Sunday costume-a black
      coat, and exceedingly short, thin trousers; with a very large white
      waistcoat, white stockings and cravat, and Blucher boots-and mounted to
      the parlour aforesaid. Nobody had come down, and he amused himself by
      drinking the contents of the milkpot with a teaspoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of slippers were heard descending the stairs. Tibbs flew to a
      chair; and a stern-looking man, of about fifty, with very little hair on
      his head, and a Sunday paper in his hand, entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, Mr. Evenson,' said Tibbs, very humbly, with something
      between a nod and a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you do, Mr. Tibbs?' replied he of the slippers, as he sat himself
      down, and began to read his paper without saying another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mr. Wisbottle in town to-day, do you know, sir?' inquired Tibbs, just
      for the sake of saying something.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think he was,' replied the stern gentleman. 'He was whistling
      "The Light Guitar," in the next room to mine, at five o'clock this
      morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's very fond of whistling,' said Tibbs, with a slight smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes-I ain't,' was the laconic reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Evenson was in the receipt of an independent income, arising
      chiefly from various houses he owned in the different suburbs. He was very
      morose and discontented. He was a thorough radical, and used to attend a
      great variety of public meetings, for the express purpose of finding fault
      with everything that was proposed. Mr. Wisbottle, on the other hand, was a
      high Tory. He was a clerk in the Woods and Forests Office, which he
      considered rather an aristocratic employment; he knew the peerage by
      heart, and, could tell you, off-hand, where any illustrious personage
      lived. He had a good set of teeth, and a capital tailor. Mr. Evenson
      looked on all these qualifications with profound contempt; and the
      consequence was that the two were always disputing, much to the
      edification of the rest of the house. It should be added, that, in
      addition to his partiality for whistling, Mr. Wisbottle had a great idea
      of his singing powers. There were two other boarders, besides the
      gentleman in the back drawing-room-Mr. Alfred Tomkins and Mr. Frederick
      O'Bleary. Mr. Tomkins was a clerk in a wine-house; he was a connoisseur in
      paintings, and had a wonderful eye for the picturesque. Mr. O'Bleary was
      an Irishman, recently imported; he was in a perfectly wild state; and had
      come over to England to be an apothecary, a clerk in a government office,
      an actor, a reporter, or anything else that turned up-he was not
      particular. He was on familiar terms with two small Irish members, and got
      franks for everybody in the house. He felt convinced that his intrinsic
      merits must procure him a high destiny. He wore shepherd's-plaid
      inexpressibles, and used to look under all the ladies' bonnets as he
      walked along the streets. His manners and appearance reminded one of
      Orson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here comes Mr. Wisbottle,' said Tibbs; and Mr. Wisbottle forthwith
      appeared in blue slippers, and a shawl dressing-gown, whistling 'Di
      piacer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, sir,' said Tibbs again. It was almost the only thing he
      ever said to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you, Tibbs?' condescendingly replied the amateur; and he walked
      to the window, and whistled louder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pretty air, that!' said Evenson, with a snarl, and without taking his
      eyes off the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Glad you like it,' replied Wisbottle, highly gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you think it would sound better, if you whistled it a little
      louder?' inquired the mastiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; I don't think it would,' rejoined the unconscious Wisbottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you what, Wisbottle,' said Evenson, who had been bottling up
      his anger for some hours-'the next time you feel disposed to whistle "The
      Light Guitar" at five o'clock in the morning, I'll trouble you to whistle
      it with your head out o' window. If you don't, I'll learn the triangle-I
      will, by-'
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of Mrs. Tibbs (with the keys in a little basket) interrupted
      the threat, and prevented its conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs apologised for being down rather late; the bell was rung; James
      brought up the urn, and received an unlimited order for dry toast and
      bacon. Tibbs sat down at the bottom of the table, and began eating
      water-cresses like a Nebuchadnezzar. Mr. O'Bleary appeared, and Mr. Alfred
      Tomkins. The compliments of the morning were exchanged, and the tea was
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      'God bless me!' exclaimed Tomkins, who had been looking out at the window.
      'Here-Wisbottle-pray come here-make haste.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wisbottle started from the table, and every one looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you see,' said the connoisseur, placing Wisbottle in the right
      position-'a little more this way: there-do you see how splendidly the
      light falls upon the left side of that broken chimney-pot at No. 48?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me! I see,' replied Wisbottle, in a tone of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never saw an object stand out so beautifully against the clear sky in
      my life,' ejaculated Alfred. Everybody (except John Evenson) echoed the
      sentiment; for Mr. Tomkins had a great character for finding out beauties
      which no one else could discover-he certainly deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have frequently observed a chimney-pot in College-green, Dublin, which
      has a much better effect,' said the patriotic O'Bleary, who never allowed
      Ireland to be outdone on any point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assertion was received with obvious incredulity, for Mr. Tomkins
      declared that no other chimney-pot in the United Kingdom, broken or
      unbroken, could be so beautiful as the one at No. 48.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room-door was suddenly thrown open, and Agnes appeared, leading in
      Mrs. Bloss, who was dressed in a geranium-coloured muslin gown, and
      displayed a gold watch of huge dimensions; a chain to match; and a
      splendid assortment of rings, with enormous stones. A general rush was
      made for a chair, and a regular introduction took place. Mr. John Evenson
      made a slight inclination of the head; Mr. Frederick O'Bleary, Mr. Alfred
      Tomkins, and Mr. Wisbottle, bowed like the mandarins in a grocer's shop;
      Tibbs rubbed hands, and went round in circles. He was observed to close
      one eye, and to assume a clock-work sort of expression with the other;
      this has been considered as a wink, and it has been reported that Agnes
      was its object. We repel the calumny, and challenge contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs inquired after Mrs. Bloss's health in a low tone. Mrs. Bloss,
      with a supreme contempt for the memory of Lindley Murray, answered the
      various questions in a most satisfactory manner; and a pause ensued,
      during which the eatables disappeared with awful rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must have been very much pleased with the appearance of the ladies
      going to the Drawing-room the other day, Mr. O'Bleary?' said Mrs. Tibbs,
      hoping to start a topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' replied Orson, with a mouthful of toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never saw anything like it before, I suppose?' suggested Wisbottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-except the Lord Lieutenant's levees,' replied O'Bleary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are they at all equal to our drawing-rooms?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, infinitely superior!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gad! I don't know,' said the aristocratic Wisbottle, 'the Dowager
      Marchioness of Publiccash was most magnificently dressed, and so was the
      Baron Slappenbachenhausen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What was he presented on?' inquired Evenson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'On his arrival in England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought so,' growled the radical; 'you never hear of these fellows
      being presented on their going away again. They know better than that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unless somebody pervades them with an apintment,' said Mrs. Bloss,
      joining in the conversation in a faint voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said Wisbottle, evading the point, 'it's a splendid sight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And did it never occur to you,' inquired the radical, who never would be
      quiet; 'did it never occur to you, that you pay for these precious
      ornaments of society?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It certainly has occurred to me,' said Wisbottle, who thought this answer
      was a poser; 'it has occurred to me, and I am willing to pay for them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, and it has occurred to me too,' replied John Evenson, 'and I ain't
      willing to pay for 'em. Then why should I?-I say, why should I?' continued
      the politician, laying down the paper, and knocking his knuckles on the
      table. 'There are two great principles-demand-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A cup of tea if you please, dear,' interrupted Tibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And supply-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I trouble you to hand this tea to Mr. Tibbs?' said Mrs. Tibbs,
      interrupting the argument, and unconsciously illustrating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thread of the orator's discourse was broken. He drank his tea and
      resumed the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If it's very fine,' said Mr. Alfred Tomkins, addressing the company in
      general, 'I shall ride down to Richmond to-day, and come back by the
      steamer. There are some splendid effects of light and shade on the Thames;
      the contrast between the blueness of the sky and the yellow water is
      frequently exceedingly beautiful.' Mr. Wisbottle hummed, 'Flow on, thou
      shining river.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We have some splendid steam-vessels in Ireland,' said O'Bleary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' said Mrs. Bloss, delighted to find a subject broached in
      which she could take part.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The accommodations are extraordinary,' said O'Bleary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Extraordinary indeed,' returned Mrs. Bloss. 'When Mr. Bloss was alive, he
      was promiscuously obligated to go to Ireland on business. I went with him,
      and raly the manner in which the ladies and gentlemen were accommodated
      with berths, is not creditable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibbs, who had been listening to the dialogue, looked aghast, and evinced
      a strong inclination to ask a question, but was checked by a look from his
      wife. Mr. Wisbottle laughed, and said Tomkins had made a pun; and Tomkins
      laughed too, and said he had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the meal passed off as breakfasts usually do.
      Conversation flagged, and people played with their teaspoons. The
      gentlemen looked out at the window; walked about the room; and, when they
      got near the door, dropped off one by one. Tibbs retired to the back
      parlour by his wife's orders, to check the green-grocer's weekly account;
      and ultimately Mrs. Tibbs and Mrs. Bloss were left alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh dear!' said the latter, 'I feel alarmingly faint; it's very singular.'
      (It certainly was, for she had eaten four pounds of solids that morning.)
      'By-the-bye,' said Mrs. Bloss, 'I have not seen Mr. What's-his-name yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Gobler?' suggested Mrs. Tibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' said Mrs. Tibbs, 'he is a most mysterious person. He has his meals
      regularly sent up-stairs, and sometimes don't leave his room for weeks
      together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't seen or heard nothing of him,' repeated Mrs. Bloss.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I dare say you'll hear him to-night,' replied Mrs. Tibbs; 'he generally
      groans a good deal on Sunday evenings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never felt such an interest in any one in my life,' ejaculated Mrs.
      Bloss. A little double-knock interrupted the conversation; Dr. Wosky was
      announced, and duly shown in. He was a little man with a red face-dressed
      of course in black, with a stiff white neckerchief. He had a very good
      practice, and plenty of money, which he had amassed by invariably
      humouring the worst fancies of all the females of all the families he had
      ever been introduced into. Mrs. Tibbs offered to retire, but was entreated
      to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my dear ma'am, and how are we?' inquired Wosky, in a soothing tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very ill, doctor-very ill,' said Mrs. Bloss, in a whisper
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! we must take care of ourselves;-we must, indeed,' said the obsequious
      Wosky, as he felt the pulse of his interesting patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How is our appetite?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bloss shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our friend requires great care,' said Wosky, appealing to Mrs. Tibbs, who
      of course assented. 'I hope, however, with the blessing of Providence,
      that we shall be enabled to make her quite stout again.' Mrs. Tibbs
      wondered in her own mind what the patient would be when she was made quite
      stout.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must take stimulants,' said the cunning Wosky-'plenty of nourishment,
      and, above all, we must keep our nerves quiet; we positively must not give
      way to our sensibilities. We must take all we can get,' concluded the
      doctor, as he pocketed his fee, 'and we must keep quiet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear man!' exclaimed Mrs. Bloss, as the doctor stepped into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charming creature indeed-quite a lady's man!' said Mrs. Tibbs, and Dr.
      Wosky rattled away to make fresh gulls of delicate females, and pocket
      fresh fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we had occasion, in a former paper, to describe a dinner at Mrs.
      Tibbs's; and as one meal went off very like another on all ordinary
      occasions; we will not fatigue our readers by entering into any other
      detailed account of the domestic economy of the establishment. We will
      therefore proceed to events, merely premising that the mysterious tenant
      of the back drawing-room was a lazy, selfish hypochondriac; always
      complaining and never ill. As his character in many respects closely
      assimilated to that of Mrs. Bloss, a very warm friendship soon sprung up
      between them. He was tall, thin, and pale; he always fancied he had a
      severe pain somewhere or other, and his face invariably wore a pinched,
      screwed-up expression; he looked, indeed, like a man who had got his feet
      in a tub of exceedingly hot water, against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two or three months after Mrs. Bloss's first appearance in Coram-
      street, John Evenson was observed to become, every day, more sarcastic and
      more ill-natured; and there was a degree of additional importance in his
      manner, which clearly showed that he fancied he had discovered something,
      which he only wanted a proper opportunity of divulging. He found it at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, the different inmates of the house were assembled in the
      drawing-room engaged in their ordinary occupations. Mr. Gobler and Mrs.
      Bloss were sitting at a small card-table near the centre window, playing
      cribbage; Mr. Wisbottle was describing semicircles on the music-stool,
      turning over the leaves of a book on the piano, and humming most
      melodiously; Alfred Tomkins was sitting at the round table, with his
      elbows duly squared, making a pencil sketch of a head considerably larger
      than his own; O'Bleary was reading Horace, and trying to look as if he
      understood it; and John Evenson had drawn his chair close to Mrs. Tibbs's
      work-table, and was talking to her very earnestly in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can assure you, Mrs. Tibbs,' said the radical, laying his forefinger on
      the muslin she was at work on; 'I can assure you, Mrs. Tibbs, that nothing
      but the interest I take in your welfare would induce me to make this
      communication. I repeat, I fear Wisbottle is endeavouring to gain the
      affections of that young woman, Agnes, and that he is in the habit of
      meeting her in the store-room on the first floor, over the leads. From my
      bedroom I distinctly heard voices there, last night. I opened my door
      immediately, and crept very softly on to the landing; there I saw Mr.
      Tibbs, who, it seems, had been disturbed also.-Bless me, Mrs. Tibbs, you
      change colour!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no-it's nothing,' returned Mrs. T. in a hurried manner; 'it's only
      the heat of the room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A flush!' ejaculated Mrs. Bloss from the card-table; 'that's good for
      four.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I thought it was Mr. Wisbottle,' said Mrs. Tibbs, after a pause, 'he
      should leave this house instantly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go!' said Mrs. Bloss again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And if I thought,' continued the hostess with a most threatening air, 'if
      I thought he was assisted by Mr. Tibbs-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One for his nob!' said Gobler.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh,' said Evenson, in a most soothing tone-he liked to make mischief-'I
      should hope Mr. Tibbs was not in any way implicated. He always appeared to
      me very harmless.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have generally found him so,' sobbed poor little Mrs. Tibbs; crying
      like a watering-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush! hush! pray-Mrs. Tibbs-consider-we shall be observed-pray, don't!'
      said John Evenson, fearing his whole plan would be interrupted. 'We will
      set the matter at rest with the utmost care, and I shall be most happy to
      assist you in doing so.' Mrs. Tibbs murmured her thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When you think every one has retired to rest to-night,' said Evenson very
      pompously, 'if you'll meet me without a light, just outside my bedroom
      door, by the staircase window, I think we can ascertain who the parties
      really are, and you will afterwards be enabled to proceed as you think
      proper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbs was easily persuaded; her curiosity was excited, her jealousy
      was roused, and the arrangement was forthwith made. She resumed her work,
      and John Evenson walked up and down the room with his hands in his
      pockets, looking as if nothing had happened. The game of cribbage was
      over, and conversation began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Mr. O'Bleary,' said the humming-top, turning round on his pivot,
      and facing the company, 'what did you think of Vauxhall the other night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it's very fair,' replied Orson, who had been enthusiastically
      delighted with the whole exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never saw anything like that Captain Ross's set-out-eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' returned the patriot, with his usual reservation-'except in Dublin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw the Count de Canky and Captain Fitzthompson in the Gardens,' said
      Wisbottle; 'they appeared much delighted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it must be beautiful,' snarled Evenson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think the white bears is partickerlerly well done,' suggested Mrs.
      Bloss. 'In their shaggy white coats, they look just like Polar bears-don't
      you think they do, Mr. Evenson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think they look a great deal more like omnibus cads on all fours,'
      replied the discontented one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon the whole, I should have liked our evening very well,' gasped
      Gobler; 'only I caught a desperate cold which increased my pain
      dreadfully! I was obliged to have several shower-baths, before I could
      leave my room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital things those shower-baths!' ejaculated Wisbottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Excellent!' said Tomkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Delightful!' chimed in O'Bleary. (He had once seen one, outside a
      tinman's.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Disgusting machines!' rejoined Evenson, who extended his dislike to
      almost every created object, masculine, feminine, or neuter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Disgusting, Mr. Evenson!' said Gobler, in a tone of strong
      indignation.-'Disgusting! Look at their utility-consider how many lives
      they have saved by promoting perspiration.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Promoting perspiration, indeed,' growled John Evenson, stopping short in
      his walk across the large squares in the pattern of the carpet-'I was ass
      enough to be persuaded some time ago to have one in my bedroom. 'Gad, I
      was in it once, and it effectually cured me, for the mere sight of it
      threw me into a profuse perspiration for six months afterwards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A titter followed this announcement, and before it had subsided James
      brought up 'the tray,' containing the remains of a leg of lamb which had
      made its dACbut at dinner; bread; cheese; an atom of butter in a forest of
      parsley; one pickled walnut and the third of another; and so forth. The
      boy disappeared, and returned again with another tray, containing glasses
      and jugs of hot and cold water. The gentlemen brought in their
      spirit-bottles; the housemaid placed divers plated bedroom candlesticks
      under the card-table; and the servants retired for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chairs were drawn round the table, and the conversation proceeded in the
      customary manner. John Evenson, who never ate supper, lolled on the sofa,
      and amused himself by contradicting everybody. O'Bleary ate as much as he
      could conveniently carry, and Mrs. Tibbs felt a due degree of indignation
      thereat; Mr. Gobler and Mrs. Bloss conversed most affectionately on the
      subject of pill-taking, and other innocent amusements; and Tomkins and
      Wisbottle 'got into an argument;' that is to say, they both talked very
      loudly and vehemently, each flattering himself that he had got some
      advantage about something, and neither of them having more than a very
      indistinct idea of what they were talking about. An hour or two passed
      away; and the boarders and the plated candlesticks retired in pairs to
      their respective bedrooms. John Evenson pulled off his boots, locked his
      door, and determined to sit up until Mr. Gobler had retired. He always sat
      in the drawing-room an hour after everybody else had left it, taking
      medicine, and groaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great Coram-street was hushed into a state of profound repose: it was
      nearly two o'clock. A hackney-coach now and then rumbled slowly by; and
      occasionally some stray lawyer's clerk, on his way home to Somers-town,
      struck his iron heel on the top of the coal-cellar with a noise resembling
      the click of a smoke-Jack. A low, monotonous, gushing sound was heard,
      which added considerably to the romantic dreariness of the scene. It was
      the water 'coming in' at number eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He must be asleep by this time,' said John Evenson to himself, after
      waiting with exemplary patience for nearly an hour after Mr. Gobler had
      left the drawing-room. He listened for a few moments; the house was
      perfectly quiet; he extinguished his rushlight, and opened his bedroom
      door. The staircase was so dark that it was impossible to see anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      'S-s-s!' whispered the mischief-maker, making a noise like the first
      indication a catherine-wheel gives of the probability of its going off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush!' whispered somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that you, Mrs. Tibbs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here;' and the misty outline of Mrs. Tibbs appeared at the staircase
      window, like the ghost of Queen Anne in the tent scene in Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This way, Mrs. Tibbs,' whispered the delighted busybody: 'give me your
      hand-there! Whoever these people are, they are in the store-room now, for
      I have been looking down from my window, and I could see that they
      accidentally upset their candlestick, and are now in darkness. You have no
      shoes on, have you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said little Mrs. Tibbs, who could hardly speak for trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well; I have taken my boots off, so we can go down, close to the store-
      room door, and listen over the banisters;' and down-stairs they both crept
      accordingly, every board creaking like a patent mangle on a Saturday
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's Wisbottle and somebody, I'll swear,' exclaimed the radical in an
      energetic whisper, when they had listened for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush-pray let's hear what they say!' exclaimed Mrs. Tibbs, the
      gratification of whose curiosity was now paramount to every other
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! if I could but believe you,' said a female voice coquettishly, 'I'd
      be bound to settle my missis for life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What does she say?' inquired Mr. Evenson, who was not quite so well
      situated as his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She says she'll settle her missis's life,' replied Mrs. Tibbs. 'The
      wretch! they're plotting murder.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know you want money,' continued the voice, which belonged to Agnes;
      'and if you'd secure me the five hundred pound, I warrant she should take
      fire soon enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that?' inquired Evenson again. He could just hear enough to want
      to hear more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think she says she'll set the house on fire,' replied the affrighted
      Mrs. Tibbs. 'But thank God I'm insured in the Phoenix!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The moment I have secured your mistress, my dear,' said a man's voice in
      a strong Irish brogue, 'you may depend on having the money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless my soul, it's Mr. O'Bleary!' exclaimed Mrs. Tibbs, in a
      parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The villain!' said the indignant Mr. Evenson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The first thing to be done,' continued the Hibernian, 'is to poison Mr.
      Gobler's mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, certainly,' returned Agnes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that?' inquired Evenson again, in an agony of curiosity and a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He says she's to mind and poison Mr. Gobler,' replied Mrs. Tibbs, aghast
      at this sacrifice of human life.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And in regard of Mrs. Tibbs,' continued O'Bleary.-Mrs. Tibbs shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush!' exclaimed Agnes, in a tone of the greatest alarm, just as Mrs.
      Tibbs was on the extreme verge of a fainting fit. 'Hush!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush!' exclaimed Evenson, at the same moment to Mrs. Tibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's somebody coming up-stairs,' said Agnes to O'Bleary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's somebody coming down-stairs,' whispered Evenson to Mrs. Tibbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go into the parlour, sir,' said Agnes to her companion. 'You will get
      there, before whoever it is, gets to the top of the kitchen stairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The drawing-room, Mrs. Tibbs!' whispered the astonished Evenson to his
      equally astonished companion; and for the drawing-room they both made,
      plainly hearing the rustling of two persons, one coming down-stairs, and
      one coming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What can it be?' exclaimed Mrs. Tibbs. 'It's like a dream. I wouldn't be
      found in this situation for the world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I,' returned Evenson, who could never bear a joke at his own expense.
      'Hush! here they are at the door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What fun!' whispered one of the new-comers.-It was Wisbottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Glorious!' replied his companion, in an equally low tone.-This was Alfred
      Tomkins. 'Who would have thought it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I told you so,' said Wisbottle, in a most knowing whisper. 'Lord bless
      you, he has paid her most extraordinary attention for the last two months.
      I saw 'em when I was sitting at the piano to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, do you know I didn't notice it?' interrupted Tomkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not notice it!' continued Wisbottle. 'Bless you; I saw him whispering to
      her, and she crying; and then I'll swear I heard him say something about
      to-night when we were all in bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They're talking of us!' exclaimed the agonised Mrs. Tibbs, as the painful
      suspicion, and a sense of their situation, flashed upon her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know it-I know it,' replied Evenson, with a melancholy consciousness
      that there was no mode of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's to be done? we cannot both stop here!' ejaculated Mrs. Tibbs, in a
      state of partial derangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll get up the chimney,' replied Evenson, who really meant what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can't,' said Mrs. Tibbs, in despair. 'You can't-it's a register
      stove.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush!' repeated John Evenson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush-hush!' cried somebody down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a d-d hushing!' said Alfred Tomkins, who began to get rather
      bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There they are!' exclaimed the sapient Wisbottle, as a rustling noise was
      heard in the store-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hark!' whispered both the young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hark!' repeated Mrs. Tibbs and Evenson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me alone, sir,' said a female voice in the store-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Hagnes!' cried another voice, which clearly belonged to Tibbs, for
      nobody else ever owned one like it, 'Oh, Hagnes-lovely creature!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be quiet, sir!' (A bounce.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hag-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be quiet, sir-I am ashamed of you. Think of your wife, Mr. Tibbs. Be
      quiet, sir!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My wife!' exclaimed the valorous Tibbs, who was clearly under the
      influence of gin-and-water, and a misplaced attachment; 'I ate her! Oh,
      Hagnes! when I was in the volunteer corps, in eighteen hundred and-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I declare I'll scream. Be quiet, sir, will you?' (Another bounce and a
      scuffle.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that?' exclaimed Tibbs, with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's what?' said Agnes, stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! you have done it nicely now, sir,' sobbed the frightened Agnes, as a
      tapping was heard at Mrs. Tibbs's bedroom door, which would have beaten
      any dozen woodpeckers hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Tibbs! Mrs. Tibbs!' called out Mrs. Bloss. 'Mrs. Tibbs, pray get
      up.' (Here the imitation of a woodpecker was resumed with tenfold
      violence.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, dear-dear!' exclaimed the wretched partner of the depraved Tibbs.
      'She's knocking at my door. We must be discovered! What will they think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Tibbs! Mrs. Tibbs!' screamed the woodpecker again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter!' shouted Gobler, bursting out of the back drawing-
      room, like the dragon at Astley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Mr. Gobler!' cried Mrs. Bloss, with a proper approximation to
      hysterics; 'I think the house is on fire, or else there's thieves in it. I
      have heard the most dreadful noises!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The devil you have!' shouted Gobler again, bouncing back into his den, in
      happy imitation of the aforesaid dragon, and returning immediately with a
      lighted candle. 'Why, what's this? Wisbottle! Tomkins! O'Bleary! Agnes!
      What the deuce! all up and dressed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Astonishing!' said Mrs. Bloss, who had run down-stairs, and taken Mr.
      Gobler's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Call Mrs. Tibbs directly, somebody,' said Gobler, turning into the front
      drawing-room.-'What! Mrs. Tibbs and Mr. Evenson!!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Tibbs and Mr. Evenson!' repeated everybody, as that unhappy pair
      were discovered: Mrs. Tibbs seated in an arm-chair by the fireplace, and
      Mr. Evenson standing by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must leave the scene that ensued to the reader's imagination. We could
      tell, how Mrs. Tibbs forthwith fainted away, and how it required the
      united strength of Mr. Wisbottle and Mr. Alfred Tomkins to hold her in her
      chair; how Mr. Evenson explained, and how his explanation was evidently
      disbelieved; how Agnes repelled the accusations of Mrs. Tibbs by proving
      that she was negotiating with Mr. O'Bleary to influence her mistress's
      affections in his behalf; and how Mr. Gobler threw a damp counterpane on
      the hopes of Mr. O'Bleary by avowing that he (Gobler) had already proposed
      to, and been accepted by, Mrs. Bloss; how Agnes was discharged from that
      lady's service; how Mr. O'Bleary discharged himself from Mrs. Tibbs's
      house, without going through the form of previously discharging his bill;
      and how that disappointed young gentleman rails against England and the
      English, and vows there is no virtue or fine feeling extant, 'except in
      Ireland.' We repeat that we could tell all this, but we love to exercise
      our self-denial, and we therefore prefer leaving it to be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady whom we have hitherto described as Mrs. Bloss, is no more. Mrs.
      Gobler exists: Mrs. Bloss has left us for ever. In a secluded retreat in
      Newington Butts, far, far removed from the noisy strife of that great
      boarding-house, the world, the enviable Gobler and his pleasing wife revel
      in retirement: happy in their complaints, their table, and their medicine,
      wafted through life by the grateful prayers of all the purveyors of animal
      food within three miles round.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would willingly stop here, but we have a painful duty imposed upon us,
      which we must discharge. Mr. and Mrs. Tibbs have separated by mutual
      consent, Mrs. Tibbs receiving one moiety of 43l. 15s. 10d., which we
      before stated to be the amount of her husband's annual income, and Mr.
      Tibbs the other. He is spending the evening of his days in retirement; and
      he is spending also, annually, that small but honourable independence. He
      resides among the original settlers at Walworth; and it has been stated,
      on unquestionable authority, that the conclusion of the volunteer story
      has been heard in a small tavern in that respectable neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Mrs. Tibbs has determined to dispose of the whole of her
      furniture by public auction, and to retire from a residence in which she
      has suffered so much. Mr. Robins has been applied to, to conduct the sale,
      and the transcendent abilities of the literary gentlemen connected with
      his establishment are now devoted to the task of drawing up the
      preliminary advertisement. It is to contain, among a variety of brilliant
      matter, seventy-eight words in large capitals, and six original quotations
      in inverted commas.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II-MR. MINNS AND HIS COUSIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Augustus Minns was a bachelor, of about forty as he said-of about
      eight-and-forty as his friends said. He was always exceedingly clean,
      precise, and tidy; perhaps somewhat priggish, and the most retiring man in
      the world. He usually wore a brown frock-coat without a wrinkle, light
      inexplicables without a spot, a neat neckerchief with a remarkably neat
      tie, and boots without a fault; moreover, he always carried a brown silk
      umbrella with an ivory handle. He was a clerk in Somerset-house, or, as he
      said himself, he held 'a responsible situation under Government.' He had a
      good and increasing salary, in addition to some 10,000l. of his own
      (invested in the funds), and he occupied a first floor in
      Tavistock-street, Covent-garden, where he had resided for twenty years,
      having been in the habit of quarrelling with his landlord the whole time:
      regularly giving notice of his intention to quit on the first day of every
      quarter, and as regularly countermanding it on the second. There were two
      classes of created objects which he held in the deepest and most unmingled
      horror; these were dogs, and children. He was not unamiable, but he could,
      at any time, have viewed the execution of a dog, or the assassination of
      an infant, with the liveliest satisfaction. Their habits were at variance
      with his love of order; and his love of order was as powerful as his love
      of life. Mr. Augustus Minns had no relations, in or near London, with the
      exception of his cousin, Mr. Octavius Budden, to whose son, whom he had
      never seen (for he disliked the father), he had consented to become
      godfather by proxy. Mr. Budden having realised a moderate fortune by
      exercising the trade or calling of a corn-chandler, and having a great
      predilection for the country, had purchased a cottage in the vicinity of
      Stamford-hill, whither he retired with the wife of his bosom, and his only
      son, Master Alexander Augustus Budden. One evening, as Mr. and Mrs. B.
      were admiring their son, discussing his various merits, talking over his
      education, and disputing whether the classics should be made an essential
      part thereof, the lady pressed so strongly upon her husband the propriety
      of cultivating the friendship of Mr. Minns in behalf of their son, that
      Mr. Budden at last made up his mind, that it should not be his fault if he
      and his cousin were not in future more intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll break the ice, my love,' said Mr. Budden, stirring up the sugar at
      the bottom of his glass of brandy-and-water, and casting a sidelong look
      at his spouse to see the effect of the announcement of his determination,
      'by asking Minns down to dine with us, on Sunday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then pray, Budden, write to your cousin at once,' replied Mrs. Budden.
      'Who knows, if we could only get him down here, but he might take a fancy
      to our Alexander, and leave him his property?-Alick, my dear, take your
      legs off the rail of the chair!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very true,' said Mr. Budden, musing, 'very true indeed, my love!' On the
      following morning, as Mr. Minns was sitting at his breakfast-table,
      alternately biting his dry toast and casting a look upon the columns of
      his morning paper, which he always read from the title to the printer's
      name, he heard a loud knock at the street-door; which was shortly
      afterwards followed by the entrance of his servant, who put into his hands
      a particularly small card, on which was engraven in immense letters, 'Mr.
      Octavius Budden, Amelia Cottage (Mrs. B.'s name was Amelia), Poplar-walk,
      Stamford-hill.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Budden!' ejaculated Minns, 'what can bring that vulgar man here!-say I'm
      asleep-say I'm out, and shall never be home again-anything to keep him
      down-stairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But please, sir, the gentleman's coming up,' replied the servant, and the
      fact was made evident, by an appalling creaking of boots on the staircase
      accompanied by a pattering noise; the cause of which, Minns could not, for
      the life of him, divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hem-show the gentleman in,' said the unfortunate bachelor. Exit servant,
      and enter Octavius preceded by a large white dog, dressed in a suit of
      fleecy hosiery, with pink eyes, large ears, and no perceptible tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of the pattering on the stairs was but too plain. Mr. Augustus
      Minns staggered beneath the shock of the dog's appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear fellow, how are you?' said Budden, as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He always spoke at the top of his voice, and always said the same thing
      half-a-dozen times.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you, my hearty?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you do, Mr. Budden?-pray take a chair!' politely stammered the
      discomfited Minns.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you-thank you-well-how are you, eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uncommonly well, thank you,' said Minns, casting a diabolical look at the
      dog, who, with his hind legs on the floor, and his fore paws resting on
      the table, was dragging a bit of bread and butter out of a plate,
      preparatory to devouring it, with the buttered side next the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you rogue!' said Budden to his dog; 'you see, Minns, he's like me,
      always at home, eh, my boy!-Egad, I'm precious hot and hungry! I've walked
      all the way from Stamford-hill this morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you breakfasted?' inquired Minns.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no!-came to breakfast with you; so ring the bell, my dear fellow,
      will you? and let's have another cup and saucer, and the cold ham.-Make
      myself at home, you see!' continued Budden, dusting his boots with a
      table-napkin. 'Ha!-ha!-ha!-'pon my life, I'm hungry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Minns rang the bell, and tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I decidedly never was so hot in my life,' continued Octavius, wiping his
      forehead; 'well, but how are you, Minns? 'Pon my soul, you wear
      capitally!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'D'ye think so?' said Minns; and he tried another smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Pon my life, I do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. B. and-what's his name-quite well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Alick-my son, you mean; never better-never better. But at such a place as
      we've got at Poplar-walk, you know, he couldn't be ill if he tried. When I
      first saw it, by Jove! it looked so knowing, with the front garden, and
      the green railings and the brass knocker, and all that-I really thought it
      was a cut above me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you think you'd like the ham better,' interrupted Minns, 'if you
      cut it the other way?' He saw, with feelings which it is impossible to
      describe, that his visitor was cutting or rather maiming the ham, in utter
      violation of all established rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank ye,' returned Budden, with the most barbarous indifference to
      crime, 'I prefer it this way, it eats short. But I say, Minns, when will
      you come down and see us? You will be delighted with the place; I know you
      will. Amelia and I were talking about you the other night, and Amelia
      said-another lump of sugar, please; thank ye-she said, don't you think you
      could contrive, my dear, to say to Mr. Minns, in a friendly way-come down,
      sir-damn the dog! he's spoiling your curtains, Minns-ha!-ha!-ha!' Minns
      leaped from his seat as though he had received the discharge from a
      galvanic battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come out, sir!-go out, hoo!' cried poor Augustus, keeping, nevertheless,
      at a very respectful distance from the dog; having read of a case of
      hydrophobia in the paper of that morning. By dint of great exertion, much
      shouting, and a marvellous deal of poking under the tables with a stick
      and umbrella, the dog was at last dislodged, and placed on the landing
      outside the door, where he immediately commenced a most appalling howling;
      at the same time vehemently scratching the paint off the two
      nicely-varnished bottom panels, until they resembled the interior of a
      backgammon-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A good dog for the country that!' coolly observed Budden to the
      distracted Minns, 'but he's not much used to confinement. But now, Minns,
      when will you come down? I'll take no denial, positively. Let's see,
      to-day's Thursday.-Will you come on Sunday? We dine at five, don't say
      no-do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a great deal of pressing, Mr. Augustus Minns, driven to despair,
      accepted the invitation, and promised to be at Poplar-walk on the ensuing
      Sunday, at a quarter before five to the minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now mind the direction,' said Budden: 'the coach goes from the Flower-
      pot, in Bishopsgate-street, every half hour. When the coach stops at the
      Swan, you'll see, immediately opposite you, a white house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which is your house-I understand,' said Minns, wishing to cut short the
      visit, and the story, at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, that's not mine; that's Grogus's, the great ironmonger's. I was
      going to say-you turn down by the side of the white house till you can't
      go another step further-mind that!-and then you turn to your right, by
      some stables-well; close to you, you'll see a wall with "Beware of the
      Dog" written on it in large letters-(Minns shuddered)-go along by the side
      of that wall for about a quarter of a mile-and anybody will show you which
      is my place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well-thank ye-good-bye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be punctual.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly: good morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say, Minns, you've got a card.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I have; thank ye.' And Mr. Octavius Budden departed, leaving his
      cousin looking forward to his visit on the following Sunday, with the
      feelings of a penniless poet to the weekly visit of his Scotch landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday arrived; the sky was bright and clear; crowds of people were
      hurrying along the streets, intent on their different schemes of pleasure
      for the day; everything and everybody looked cheerful and happy except Mr.
      Augustus Minns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was fine, but the heat was considerable; when Mr. Minns had fagged
      up the shady side of Fleet-street, Cheapside, and Threadneedle- street, he
      had become pretty warm, tolerably dusty, and it was getting late into the
      bargain. By the most extraordinary good fortune, however, a coach was
      waiting at the Flower-pot, into which Mr. Augustus Minns got, on the
      solemn assurance of the cad that the vehicle would start in three
      minutes-that being the very utmost extremity of time it was allowed to
      wait by Act of Parliament. A quarter of an hour elapsed, and there were no
      signs of moving. Minns looked at his watch for the sixth time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Coachman, are you going or not?' bawled Mr. Minns, with his head and half
      his body out of the coach window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Di-rectly, sir,' said the coachman, with his hands in his pockets,
      looking as much unlike a man in a hurry as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bill, take them cloths off.' Five minutes more elapsed: at the end of
      which time the coachman mounted the box, from whence he looked down the
      street, and up the street, and hailed all the pedestrians for another five
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Coachman! if you don't go this moment, I shall get out,' said Mr. Minns,
      rendered desperate by the lateness of the hour, and the impossibility of
      being in Poplar-walk at the appointed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Going this minute, sir,' was the reply;-and, accordingly, the machine
      trundled on for a couple of hundred yards, and then stopped again. Minns
      doubled himself up in a corner of the coach, and abandoned himself to his
      fate, as a child, a mother, a bandbox and a parasol, became his
      fellow-passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was an affectionate and an amiable infant; the little dear
      mistook Minns for his other parent, and screamed to embrace him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be quiet, dear,' said the mamma, restraining the impetuosity of the
      darling, whose little fat legs were kicking, and stamping, and twining
      themselves into the most complicated forms, in an ecstasy of impatience.
      'Be quiet, dear, that's not your papa.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank Heaven I am not!' thought Minns, as the first gleam of pleasure he
      had experienced that morning shone like a meteor through his wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Playfulness was agreeably mingled with affection in the disposition of the
      boy. When satisfied that Mr. Minns was not his parent, he endeavoured to
      attract his notice by scraping his drab trousers with his dirty shoes,
      poking his chest with his mamma's parasol, and other nameless endearments
      peculiar to infancy, with which he beguiled the tediousness of the ride,
      apparently very much to his own satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the unfortunate gentleman arrived at the Swan, he found to his great
      dismay, that it was a quarter past five. The white house, the stables, the
      'Beware of the Dog,'-every landmark was passed, with a rapidity not
      unusual to a gentleman of a certain age when too late for dinner. After
      the lapse of a few minutes, Mr. Minns found himself opposite a yellow
      brick house with a green door, brass knocker, and door-plate, green
      window-frames and ditto railings, with 'a garden' in front, that is to
      say, a small loose bit of gravelled ground, with one round and two scalene
      triangular beds, containing a fir-tree, twenty or thirty bulbs, and an
      unlimited number of marigolds. The taste of Mr. and Mrs. Budden was
      further displayed by the appearance of a Cupid on each side of the door,
      perched upon a heap of large chalk flints, variegated with pink
      conch-shells. His knock at the door was answered by a stumpy boy, in drab
      livery, cotton stockings and high-lows, who, after hanging his hat on one
      of the dozen brass pegs which ornamented the passage, denominated by
      courtesy 'The Hall,' ushered him into a front drawing-room commanding a
      very extensive view of the backs of the neighbouring houses. The usual
      ceremony of introduction, and so forth, over, Mr. Minns took his seat: not
      a little agitated at finding that he was the last comer, and, somehow or
      other, the Lion of about a dozen people, sitting together in a small
      drawing-room, getting rid of that most tedious of all time, the time
      preceding dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Brogson,' said Budden, addressing an elderly gentleman in a black
      coat, drab knee-breeches, and long gaiters, who, under pretence of
      inspecting the prints in an Annual, had been engaged in satisfying himself
      on the subject of Mr. Minns's general appearance, by looking at him over
      the tops of the leaves-'Well, Brogson, what do ministers mean to do? Will
      they go out, or what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-why-really, you know, I'm the last person in the world to ask for
      news. Your cousin, from his situation, is the most likely person to answer
      the question.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Minns assured the last speaker, that although he was in Somerset-
      house, he possessed no official communication relative to the projects of
      his Majesty's Ministers. But his remark was evidently received
      incredulously; and no further conjectures being hazarded on the subject, a
      long pause ensued, during which the company occupied themselves in
      coughing and blowing their noses, until the entrance of Mrs. Budden caused
      a general rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony of introduction being over, dinner was announced, and down-
      stairs the party proceeded accordingly-Mr. Minns escorting Mrs. Budden as
      far as the drawing-room door, but being prevented, by the narrowness of
      the staircase, from extending his gallantry any farther. The dinner passed
      off as such dinners usually do. Ever and anon, amidst the clatter of
      knives and forks, and the hum of conversation, Mr. B.'s voice might be
      heard, asking a friend to take wine, and assuring him he was glad to see
      him; and a great deal of by-play took place between Mrs. B. and the
      servants, respecting the removal of the dishes, during which her
      countenance assumed all the variations of a weather-glass, from 'stormy'
      to 'set fair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the dessert and wine being placed on the table, the servant, in
      compliance with a significant look from Mrs. B., brought down 'Master
      Alexander,' habited in a sky-blue suit with silver buttons; and possessing
      hair of nearly the same colour as the metal. After sundry praises from his
      mother, and various admonitions as to his behaviour from his father, he
      was introduced to his godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my little fellow-you are a fine boy, ain't you?' said Mr. Minns, as
      happy as a tomtit on birdlime.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How old are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eight, next We'nsday. How old are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Alexander,' interrupted his mother, 'how dare you ask Mr. Minns how old
      he is!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He asked me how old I was,' said the precocious child, to whom Minns had
      from that moment internally resolved that he never would bequeath one
      shilling. As soon as the titter occasioned by the observation had
      subsided, a little smirking man with red whiskers, sitting at the bottom
      of the table, who during the whole of dinner had been endeavouring to
      obtain a listener to some stories about Sheridan, called, out, with a very
      patronising air, 'Alick, what part of speech is be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A verb.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's a good boy,' said Mrs. Budden, with all a mother's pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, you know what a verb is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer; as, I am-I
      rule-I am ruled. Give me an apple, Ma.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll give you an apple,' replied the man with the red whiskers, who was
      an established friend of the family, or in other words was always invited
      by Mrs. Budden, whether Mr. Budden liked it or not, 'if you'll tell me
      what is the meaning of be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be?' said the prodigy, after a little hesitation-'an insect that gathers
      honey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, dear,' frowned Mrs. Budden; 'B double E is the substantive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think he knows much yet about common substantives,' said the
      smirking gentleman, who thought this an admirable opportunity for letting
      off a joke. 'It's clear he's not very well acquainted with proper names.
      He! he! he!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gentlemen,' called out Mr. Budden, from the end of the table, in a
      stentorian voice, and with a very important air, 'will you have the
      goodness to charge your glasses? I have a toast to propose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hear! hear!' cried the gentlemen, passing the decanters. After they had
      made the round of the table, Mr. Budden proceeded-'Gentlemen; there is an
      individual present-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hear! hear!' said the little man with red whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray be quiet, Jones,' remonstrated Budden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say, gentlemen, there is an individual present,' resumed the host, 'in
      whose society, I am sure we must take great delight-and-and-the
      conversation of that individual must have afforded to every one present,
      the utmost pleasure.' ['Thank Heaven, he does not mean me!' thought Minns,
      conscious that his diffidence and exclusiveness had prevented his saying
      above a dozen words since he entered the house.] 'Gentlemen, I am but a
      humble individual myself, and I perhaps ought to apologise for allowing
      any individual feeling of friendship and affection for the person I allude
      to, to induce me to venture to rise, to propose the health of that
      person-a person that, I am sure-that is to say, a person whose virtues
      must endear him to those who know him-and those who have not the pleasure
      of knowing him, cannot dislike him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hear! hear!' said the company, in a tone of encouragement and approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gentlemen,' continued Budden, 'my cousin is a man who-who is a relation
      of my own.' (Hear! hear!) Minns groaned audibly. 'Who I am most happy to
      see here, and who, if he were not here, would certainly have deprived us
      of the great pleasure we all feel in seeing him. (Loud cries of hear!)
      Gentlemen, I feel that I have already trespassed on your attention for too
      long a time. With every feeling-of-with every sentiment of-of-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gratification'-suggested the friend of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      '-Of gratification, I beg to propose the health of Mr. Minns.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Standing, gentlemen!' shouted the indefatigable little man with the
      whiskers-'and with the honours. Take your time from me, if you please.
      Hip! hip! hip!-Za!-Hip! hip! hip!-Za!-Hip hip!-Za-a-a!'
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were now fixed on the subject of the toast, who by gulping down
      port wine at the imminent hazard of suffocation, endeavoured to conceal
      his confusion. After as long a pause as decency would admit, he rose, but,
      as the newspapers sometimes say in their reports, 'we regret that we are
      quite unable to give even the substance of the honourable gentleman's
      observations.' The words 'present company-honour-present occasion,' and
      'great happiness'-heard occasionally, and repeated at intervals, with a
      countenance expressive of the utmost confusion and misery, convinced the
      company that he was making an excellent speech; and, accordingly, on his
      resuming his seat, they cried 'Bravo!' and manifested tumultuous applause.
      Jones, who had been long watching his opportunity, then darted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Budden,' said he, 'will you allow me to propose a toast?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' replied Budden, adding in an under-tone to Minns right across
      the table, 'Devilish sharp fellow that: you'll be very much pleased with
      his speech. He talks equally well on any subject.' Minns bowed, and Mr.
      Jones proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has on several occasions, in various instances, under many
      circumstances, and in different companies, fallen to my lot to propose a
      toast to those by whom, at the time, I have had the honour to be
      surrounded, I have sometimes, I will cheerfully own-for why should I deny
      it?-felt the overwhelming nature of the task I have undertaken, and my own
      utter incapability to do justice to the subject. If such have been my
      feelings, however, on former occasions, what must they be now-now-under
      the extraordinary circumstances in which I am placed. (Hear! hear!) To
      describe my feelings accurately, would be impossible; but I cannot give
      you a better idea of them, gentlemen, than by referring to a circumstance
      which happens, oddly enough, to occur to my mind at the moment. On one
      occasion, when that truly great and illustrious man, Sheridan, was-'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there is no knowing what new villainy in the form of a joke would
      have been heaped on the grave of that very ill-used man, Mr. Sheridan, if
      the boy in drab had not at that moment entered the room in a breathless
      state, to report that, as it was a very wet night, the nine o'clock stage
      had come round, to know whether there was anybody going to town, as, in
      that case, he (the nine o'clock) had room for one inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Minns started up; and, despite countless exclamations of surprise, and
      entreaties to stay, persisted in his determination to accept the vacant
      place. But, the brown silk umbrella was nowhere to be found; and as the
      coachman couldn't wait, he drove back to the Swan, leaving word for Mr.
      Minns to 'run round' and catch him. However, as it did not occur to Mr.
      Minns for some ten minutes or so, that he had left the brown silk umbrella
      with the ivory handle in the other coach, coming down; and, moreover, as
      he was by no means remarkable for speed, it is no matter of surprise that
      when he accomplished the feat of 'running round' to the Swan, the
      coach-the last coach-had gone without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was somewhere about three o'clock in the morning, when Mr. Augustus
      Minns knocked feebly at the street-door of his lodgings in Tavistock-
      street, cold, wet, cross, and miserable. He made his will next morning,
      and his professional man informs us, in that strict confidence in which we
      inform the public, that neither the name of Mr. Octavius Budden, nor of
      Mrs. Amelia Budden, nor of Master Alexander Augustus Budden, appears
      therein.

      CHAPTER III-SENTIMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Miss Crumptons, or to quote the authority of the inscription on the
      garden-gate of Minerva House, Hammersmith, 'The Misses Crumpton,' were two
      unusually tall, particularly thin, and exceedingly skinny personages: very
      upright, and very yellow. Miss Amelia Crumpton owned to thirty-eight, and
      Miss Maria Crumpton admitted she was forty; an admission which was
      rendered perfectly unnecessary by the self-evident fact of her being at
      least fifty. They dressed in the most interesting manner-like twins! and
      looked as happy and comfortable as a couple of marigolds run to seed. They
      were very precise, had the strictest possible ideas of propriety, wore
      false hair, and always smelt very strongly of lavender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minerva House, conducted under the auspices of the two sisters, was a
      'finishing establishment for young ladies,' where some twenty girls of the
      ages of from thirteen to nineteen inclusive, acquired a smattering of
      everything, and a knowledge of nothing; instruction in French and Italian,
      dancing lessons twice a-week; and other necessaries of life. The house was
      a white one, a little removed from the roadside, with close palings in
      front. The bedroom windows were always left partly open, to afford a
      bird's-eye view of numerous little bedsteads with very white dimity
      furniture, and thereby impress the passer-by with a due sense of the
      luxuries of the establishment; and there was a front parlour hung round
      with highly varnished maps which nobody ever looked at, and filled with
      books which no one ever read, appropriated exclusively to the reception of
      parents, who, whenever they called, could not fail to be struck with the
      very deep appearance of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Amelia, my dear,' said Miss Maria Crumpton, entering the school-room one
      morning, with her false hair in papers: as she occasionally did, in order
      to impress the young ladies with a conviction of its reality. 'Amelia, my
      dear, here is a most gratifying note I have just received. You needn't
      mind reading it aloud.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Amelia, thus advised, proceeded to read the following note with an
      air of great triumph:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cornelius Brook Dingwall, Esq., M.P., presents his compliments to Miss
      Crumpton, and will feel much obliged by Miss Crumpton's calling on him, if
      she conveniently can, to-morrow morning at one o'clock, as Cornelius Brook
      Dingwall, Esq., M.P., is anxious to see Miss Crumpton on the subject of
      placing Miss Brook Dingwall under her charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Adelphi.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Monday morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A Member of Parliament's daughter!' ejaculated Amelia, in an ecstatic
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A Member of Parliament's daughter!' repeated Miss Maria, with a smile of
      delight, which, of course, elicited a concurrent titter of pleasure from
      all the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's exceedingly delightful!' said Miss Amelia; whereupon all the young
      ladies murmured their admiration again. Courtiers are but school-boys, and
      court-ladies school-girl's.
    </p>
    <p>
      So important an announcement at once superseded the business of the day. A
      holiday was declared, in commemoration of the great event; the Miss
      Crumptons retired to their private apartment to talk it over; the smaller
      girls discussed the probable manners and customs of the daughter of a
      Member of Parliament; and the young ladies verging on eighteen wondered
      whether she was engaged, whether she was pretty, whether she wore much
      bustle, and many other whethers of equal importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Miss Crumptons proceeded to the Adelphi at the appointed time next
      day, dressed, of course, in their best style, and looking as amiable as
      they possibly could-which, by-the-bye, is not saying much for them. Having
      sent in their cards, through the medium of a red-hot looking footman in
      bright livery, they were ushered into the august presence of the profound
      Dingwall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius Brook Dingwall, Esq., M.P., was very haughty, solemn, and
      portentous. He had, naturally, a somewhat spasmodic expression of
      countenance, which was not rendered the less remarkable by his wearing an
      extremely stiff cravat. He was wonderfully proud of the M.P. attached to
      his name, and never lost an opportunity of reminding people of his
      dignity. He had a great idea of his own abilities, which must have been a
      great comfort to him, as no one else had; and in diplomacy, on a small
      scale, in his own family arrangements, he considered himself unrivalled.
      He was a county magistrate, and discharged the duties of his station with
      all due justice and impartiality; frequently committing poachers, and
      occasionally committing himself. Miss Brook Dingwall was one of that
      numerous class of young ladies, who, like adverbs, may be known by their
      answering to a commonplace question, and doing nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the present occasion, this talented individual was seated in a small
      library at a table covered with papers, doing nothing, but trying to look
      busy, playing at shop. Acts of Parliament, and letters directed to
      'Cornelius Brook Dingwall, Esq., M.P.,' were ostentatiously scattered over
      the table; at a little distance from which, Mrs. Brook Dingwall was seated
      at work. One of those public nuisances, a spoiled child, was playing about
      the room, dressed after the most approved fashion-in a blue tunic with a
      black belt-a quarter of a yard wide, fastened with an immense
      buckle-looking like a robber in a melodrama, seen through a diminishing
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little pleasantry from the sweet child, who amused himself by
      running away with Miss Maria Crumpton's chair as fast as it was placed for
      her, the visitors were seated, and Cornelius Brook Dingwall, Esq., opened
      the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sent for Miss Crumpton, he said, in consequence of the high
      character he had received of her establishment from his friend, Sir Alfred
      Muggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crumpton murmured her acknowledgments to him (Muggs), and Cornelius
      proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One of my principal reasons, Miss Crumpton, for parting with my daughter,
      is, that she has lately acquired some sentimental ideas, which it is most
      desirable to eradicate from her young mind.' (Here the little innocent
      before noticed, fell out of an arm-chair with an awful crash.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Naughty boy!' said his mamma, who appeared more surprised at his taking
      the liberty of falling down, than at anything else; 'I'll ring the bell
      for James to take him away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray don't check him, my love,' said the diplomatist, as soon as he could
      make himself heard amidst the unearthly howling consequent upon the threat
      and the tumble. 'It all arises from his great flow of spirits.' This last
      explanation was addressed to Miss Crumpton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, sir,' replied the antique Maria: not exactly seeing, however,
      the connexion between a flow of animal spirits, and a fall from an
      arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence was restored, and the M.P. resumed: 'Now, I know nothing so likely
      to effect this object, Miss Crumpton, as her mixing constantly in the
      society of girls of her own age; and, as I know that in your establishment
      she will meet such as are not likely to contaminate her young mind, I
      propose to send her to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngest Miss Crumpton expressed the acknowledgments of the
      establishment generally. Maria was rendered speechless by bodily pain. The
      dear little fellow, having recovered his animal spirits, was standing upon
      her most tender foot, by way of getting his face (which looked like a
      capital O in a red-lettered play-bill) on a level with the writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, Lavinia will be a parlour boarder,' continued the enviable
      father; 'and on one point I wish my directions to be strictly observed.
      The fact is, that some ridiculous love affair, with a person much her
      inferior in life, has been the cause of her present state of mind. Knowing
      that of course, under your care, she can have no opportunity of meeting
      this person, I do not object to-indeed, I should rather prefer-her mixing
      with such society as you see yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This important statement was again interrupted by the high-spirited little
      creature, in the excess of his joyousness breaking a pane of glass, and
      nearly precipitating himself into an adjacent area. James was rung for;
      considerable confusion and screaming succeeded; two little blue legs were
      seen to kick violently in the air as the man left the room, and the child
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Brook Dingwall would like Miss Brook Dingwall to learn everything,'
      said Mrs. Brook Dingwall, who hardly ever said anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' said both the Miss Crumptons together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And as I trust the plan I have devised will be effectual in weaning my
      daughter from this absurd idea, Miss Crumpton,' continued the legislator,
      'I hope you will have the goodness to comply, in all respects, with any
      request I may forward to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The promise was of course made; and after a lengthened discussion,
      conducted on behalf of the Dingwalls with the most becoming diplomatic
      gravity, and on that of the Crumptons with profound respect, it was
      finally arranged that Miss Lavinia should be forwarded to Hammersmith on
      the next day but one, on which occasion the half-yearly ball given at the
      establishment was to take place. It might divert the dear girl's mind.
      This, by the way, was another bit of diplomacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lavinia was introduced to her future governess, and both the Miss
      Crumptons pronounced her 'a most charming girl;' an opinion which, by a
      singular coincidence, they always entertained of any new pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtesies were exchanged, acknowledgments expressed, condescension
      exhibited, and the interview terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparations, to make use of theatrical phraseology, 'on a scale of
      magnitude never before attempted,' were incessantly made at Minerva House
      to give every effect to the forthcoming ball. The largest room in the
      house was pleasingly ornamented with blue calico roses, plaid tulips, and
      other equally natural-looking artificial flowers, the work of the young
      ladies themselves. The carpet was taken up, the folding- doors were taken
      down, the furniture was taken out, and rout-seats were taken in. The
      linen-drapers of Hammersmith were astounded at the sudden demand for blue
      sarsenet ribbon, and long white gloves. Dozens of geraniums were purchased
      for bouquets, and a harp and two violins were bespoke from town, in
      addition to the grand piano already on the premises. The young ladies who
      were selected to show off on the occasion, and do credit to the
      establishment, practised incessantly, much to their own satisfaction, and
      greatly to the annoyance of the lame old gentleman over the way; and a
      constant correspondence was kept up, between the Misses Crumpton and the
      Hammersmith pastrycook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening came; and then there was such a lacing of stays, and tying of
      sandals, and dressing of hair, as never can take place with a proper
      degree of bustle out of a boarding-school. The smaller girls managed to be
      in everybody's way, and were pushed about accordingly; and the elder ones
      dressed, and tied, and flattered, and envied, one another, as earnestly
      and sincerely as if they had actually come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do I look, dear?' inquired Miss Emily Smithers, the belle of the
      house, of Miss Caroline Wilson, who was her bosom friend, because she was
      the ugliest girl in Hammersmith, or out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! charming, dear. How do I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Delightful! you never looked so handsome,' returned the belle, adjusting
      her own dress, and not bestowing a glance on her poor companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope young Hilton will come early,' said another young lady to Miss
      somebody else, in a fever of expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure he'd be highly flattered if he knew it,' returned the other, who
      was practising l'ACtAC.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! he's so handsome,' said the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such a charming person!' added a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such a distinguAC air!' said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, what do you think?' said another girl, running into the room; 'Miss
      Crumpton says her cousin's coming.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What! Theodosius Butler?' said everybody in raptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is he handsome?' inquired a novice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not particularly handsome,' was the general reply; 'but, oh, so
      clever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Theodosius Butler was one of those immortal geniuses who are to be met
      with in almost every circle. They have, usually, very deep, monotonous
      voices. They always persuade themselves that they are wonderful persons,
      and that they ought to be very miserable, though they don't precisely know
      why. They are very conceited, and usually possess half an idea; but, with
      enthusiastic young ladies, and silly young gentlemen, they are very
      wonderful persons. The individual in question, Mr. Theodosius, had written
      a pamphlet containing some very weighty considerations on the expediency
      of doing something or other; and as every sentence contained a good many
      words of four syllables, his admirers took it for granted that he meant a
      good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps that's he,' exclaimed several young ladies, as the first pull of
      the evening threatened destruction to the bell of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      An awful pause ensued. Some boxes arrived and a young lady-Miss Brook
      Dingwall, in full ball costume, with an immense gold chain round her neck,
      and her dress looped up with a single rose; an ivory fan in her hand, and
      a most interesting expression of despair in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miss Crumptons inquired after the family, with the most excruciating
      anxiety, and Miss Brook Dingwall was formally introduced to her future
      companions. The Miss Crumptons conversed with the young ladies in the most
      mellifluous tones, in order that Miss Brook Dingwall might be properly
      impressed with their amiable treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pull at the bell. Mr. Dadson the writing-master, and his wife. The
      wife in green silk, with shoes and cap-trimmings to correspond: the
      writing-master in a white waistcoat, black knee-shorts, and ditto silk
      stockings, displaying a leg large enough for two writing-masters. The
      young ladies whispered one another, and the writing-master and his wife
      flattered the Miss Crumptons, who were dressed in amber, with long sashes,
      like dolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated pulls at the bell, and arrivals too numerous to particularise:
      papas and mammas, and aunts and uncles, the owners and guardians of the
      different pupils; the singing-master, Signor Lobskini, in a black wig; the
      piano-forte player and the violins; the harp, in a state of intoxication;
      and some twenty young men, who stood near the door, and talked to one
      another, occasionally bursting into a giggle. A general hum of
      conversation. Coffee handed round, and plentifully partaken of by fat
      mammas, who looked like the stout people who come on in pantomimes for the
      sole purpose of being knocked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular Mr. Hilton was the next arrival; and he having, at the request
      of the Miss Crumptons, undertaken the office of Master of the Ceremonies,
      the quadrilles commenced with considerable spirit. The young men by the
      door gradually advanced into the middle of the room, and in time became
      sufficiently at ease to consent to be introduced to partners. The
      writing-master danced every set, springing about with the most fearful
      agility, and his wife played a rubber in the back-parlour-a little room
      with five book-shelves, dignified by the name of the study. Setting her
      down to whist was a half-yearly piece of generalship on the part of the
      Miss Crumptons; it was necessary to hide her somewhere, on account of her
      being a fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interesting Lavinia Brook Dingwall was the only girl present, who
      appeared to take no interest in the proceedings of the evening. In vain
      was she solicited to dance; in vain was the universal homage paid to her
      as the daughter of a member of parliament. She was equally unmoved by the
      splendid tenor of the inimitable Lobskini, and the brilliant execution of
      Miss Laetitia Parsons, whose performance of 'The Recollections of Ireland'
      was universally declared to be almost equal to that of Moscheles himself.
      Not even the announcement of the arrival of Mr. Theodosius Butler could
      induce her to leave the corner of the back drawing-room in which she was
      seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, Theodosius,' said Miss Maria Crumpton, after that enlightened
      pamphleteer had nearly run the gauntlet of the whole company, 'I must
      introduce you to our new pupil.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodosius looked as if he cared for nothing earthly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's the daughter of a member of parliament,' said Maria.-Theodosius
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And her name is-?' he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Brook Dingwall.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great Heaven!' poetically exclaimed Theodosius, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crumpton commenced the introduction in due form. Miss Brook Dingwall
      languidly raised her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Edward!' she exclaimed, with a half-shriek, on seeing the well-known
      nankeen legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, as Miss Maria Crumpton possessed no remarkable share of
      penetration, and as it was one of the diplomatic arrangements that no
      attention was to be paid to Miss Lavinia's incoherent exclamations, she
      was perfectly unconscious of the mutual agitation of the parties; and
      therefore, seeing that the offer of his hand for the next quadrille was
      accepted, she left him by the side of Miss Brook Dingwall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Edward!' exclaimed that most romantic of all romantic young ladies,
      as the light of science seated himself beside her, 'Oh, Edward, is it
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Theodosius assured the dear creature, in the most impassioned manner,
      that he was not conscious of being anybody but himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then why-why-this disguise? Oh! Edward M'Neville Walter, what have I not
      suffered on your account?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lavinia, hear me,' replied the hero, in his most poetic strain. 'Do not
      condemn me unheard. If anything that emanates from the soul of such a
      wretch as I, can occupy a place in your recollection-if any being, so
      vile, deserve your notice-you may remember that I once published a
      pamphlet (and paid for its publication) entitled "Considerations on the
      Policy of Removing the Duty on Bees'-wax."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do-I do!' sobbed Lavinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That,' continued the lover, 'was a subject to which your father was
      devoted heart and soul.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was-he was!' reiterated the sentimentalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I knew it,' continued Theodosius, tragically; 'I knew it-I forwarded him
      a copy. He wished to know me. Could I disclose my real name? Never! No, I
      assumed that name which you have so often pronounced in tones of
      endearment. As M'Neville Walter, I devoted myself to the stirring cause;
      as M'Neville Walter I gained your heart; in the same character I was
      ejected from your house by your father's domestics; and in no character at
      all have I since been enabled to see you. We now meet again, and I proudly
      own that I am-Theodosius Butler.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady appeared perfectly satisfied with this argumentative
      address, and bestowed a look of the most ardent affection on the immortal
      advocate of bees'-wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I hope,' said he, 'that the promise your father's violent behaviour
      interrupted, may be renewed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us join this set,' replied Lavinia, coquettishly-for girls of
      nineteen can coquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' ejaculated he of the nankeens. 'I stir not from this spot, writhing
      under this torture of suspense. May I-may I-hope?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The promise is renewed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have your permission?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To the fullest extent?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know it,' returned the blushing Lavinia. The contortions of the
      interesting Butler's visage expressed his raptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could dilate upon the occurrences that ensued. How Mr. Theodosius and
      Miss Lavinia danced, and talked, and sighed for the remainder of the
      evening-how the Miss Crumptons were delighted thereat. How the writing-
      master continued to frisk about with one-horse power, and how his wife,
      from some unaccountable freak, left the whist-table in the little back-
      parlour, and persisted in displaying her green head-dress in the most
      conspicuous part of the drawing-room. How the supper consisted of small
      triangular sandwiches in trays, and a tart here and there by way of
      variety; and how the visitors consumed warm water disguised with lemon,
      and dotted with nutmeg, under the denomination of negus. These, and other
      matters of as much interest, however, we pass over, for the purpose of
      describing a scene of even more importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight after the date of the ball, Cornelius Brook Dingwall, Esq.,
      M.P., was seated at the same library-table, and in the same room, as we
      have before described. He was alone, and his face bore an expression of
      deep thought and solemn gravity-he was drawing up 'A Bill for the better
      observance of Easter Monday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman tapped at the door-the legislator started from his reverie,
      and 'Miss Crumpton' was announced. Permission was given for Miss Crumpton
      to enter the sanctum; Maria came sliding in, and having taken her seat
      with a due portion of affectation, the footman retired, and the governess
      was left alone with the M.P. Oh! how she longed for the presence of a
      third party! Even the facetious young gentleman would have been a relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crumpton began the duet. She hoped Mrs. Brook Dingwall and the
      handsome little boy were in good health.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were. Mrs. Brook Dingwall and little Frederick were at Brighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Much obliged to you, Miss Crumpton,' said Cornelius, in his most
      dignified manner, 'for your attention in calling this morning. I should
      have driven down to Hammersmith, to see Lavinia, but your account was so
      very satisfactory, and my duties in the House occupy me so much, that I
      determined to postpone it for a week. How has she gone on?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well indeed, sir,' returned Maria, dreading to inform the father
      that she had gone off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, I thought the plan on which I proceeded would be a match for her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a favourable opportunity to say that somebody else had been a
      match for her. But the unfortunate governess was unequal to the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have persevered strictly in the line of conduct I prescribed, Miss
      Crumpton?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Strictly, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You tell me in your note that her spirits gradually improved.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very much indeed, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure. I was convinced they would.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I fear, sir,' said Miss Crumpton, with visible emotion, 'I fear the
      plan has not succeeded, quite so well as we could have wished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No!' exclaimed the prophet. 'Bless me! Miss Crumpton, you look alarmed.
      What has happened?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Brook Dingwall, sir-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has gone, sir'-said Maria, exhibiting a strong inclination to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gone!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eloped, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eloped!-Who with-when-where-how?' almost shrieked the agitated
      diplomatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural yellow of the unfortunate Maria's face changed to all the hues
      of the rainbow, as she laid a small packet on the member's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurriedly opened it. A letter from his daughter, and another from
      Theodosius. He glanced over their contents-'Ere this reaches you, far
      distant-appeal to feelings-love to distraction-bees'-wax-slavery,' &amp;c.,
      &amp;c. He dashed his hand to his forehead, and paced the room with
      fearfully long strides, to the great alarm of the precise Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now mind; from this time forward,' said Mr. Brook Dingwall, suddenly
      stopping at the table, and beating time upon it with his hand; 'from this
      time forward, I never will, under any circumstances whatever, permit a man
      who writes pamphlets to enter any other room of this house but the
      kitchen.-I'll allow my daughter and her husband one hundred and fifty
      pounds a-year, and never see their faces again: and, damme! ma'am, I'll
      bring in a bill for the abolition of finishing-schools.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time has elapsed since this passionate declaration. Mr. and Mrs.
      Butler are at present rusticating in a small cottage at Ball's-pond,
      pleasantly situated in the immediate vicinity of a brick-field. They have
      no family. Mr. Theodosius looks very important, and writes incessantly;
      but, in consequence of a gross combination on the part of publishers, none
      of his productions appear in print. His young wife begins to think that
      ideal misery is preferable to real unhappiness; and that a marriage,
      contracted in haste, and repented at leisure, is the cause of more
      substantial wretchedness than she ever anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      On cool reflection, Cornelius Brook Dingwall, Esq., M.P., was reluctantly
      compelled to admit that the untoward result of his admirable arrangements
      was attributable, not to the Miss Crumptons, but his own diplomacy. He,
      however, consoles himself, like some other small diplomatists, by
      satisfactorily proving that if his plans did not succeed, they ought to
      have done so. Minerva House is in status quo, and 'The Misses Crumpton'
      remain in the peaceable and undisturbed enjoyment of all the advantages
      resulting from their Finishing-School.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV-THE TUGGSES AT RAMSGATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there dwelt, in a narrow street on the Surrey side of the
      water, within three minutes' walk of old London Bridge, Mr. Joseph Tuggs-a
      little dark-faced man, with shiny hair, twinkling eyes, short legs, and a
      body of very considerable thickness, measuring from the centre button of
      his waistcoat in front, to the ornamental buttons of his coat behind. The
      figure of the amiable Mrs. Tuggs, if not perfectly symmetrical, was
      decidedly comfortable; and the form of her only daughter, the accomplished
      Miss Charlotte Tuggs, was fast ripening into that state of luxuriant
      plumpness which had enchanted the eyes, and captivated the heart, of Mr.
      Joseph Tuggs in his earlier days. Mr. Simon Tuggs, his only son, and Miss
      Charlotte Tuggs's only brother, was as differently formed in body, as he
      was differently constituted in mind, from the remainder of his family.
      There was that elongation in his thoughtful face, and that tendency to
      weakness in his interesting legs, which tell so forcibly of a great mind
      and romantic disposition. The slightest traits of character in such a
      being, possess no mean interest to speculative minds. He usually appeared
      in public, in capacious shoes with black cotton stockings; and was
      observed to be particularly attached to a black glazed stock, without tie
      or ornament of any description.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is perhaps no profession, however useful; no pursuit, however
      meritorious; which can escape the petty attacks of vulgar minds. Mr.
      Joseph Tuggs was a grocer. It might be supposed that a grocer was beyond
      the breath of calumny; but no-the neighbours stigmatised him as a
      chandler; and the poisonous voice of envy distinctly asserted that he
      dispensed tea and coffee by the quartern, retailed sugar by the ounce,
      cheese by the slice, tobacco by the screw, and butter by the pat. These
      taunts, however, were lost upon the Tuggses. Mr. Tuggs attended to the
      grocery department; Mrs. Tuggs to the cheesemongery; and Miss Tuggs to her
      education. Mr. Simon Tuggs kept his father's books, and his own counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine spring afternoon, the latter gentleman was seated on a tub of
      weekly Dorset, behind the little red desk with a wooden rail, which
      ornamented a corner of the counter; when a stranger dismounted from a cab,
      and hastily entered the shop. He was habited in black cloth, and bore with
      him, a green umbrella, and a blue bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Tuggs?' said the stranger, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My name is Tuggs,' replied Mr. Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the other Mr. Tuggs,' said the stranger, looking towards the glass
      door which led into the parlour behind the shop, and on the inside of
      which, the round face of Mr. Tuggs, senior, was distinctly visible,
      peeping over the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Simon gracefully waved his pen, as if in intimation of his wish that
      his father would advance. Mr. Joseph Tuggs, with considerable celerity,
      removed his face from the curtain and placed it before the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I come from the Temple,' said the man with the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From the Temple!' said Mrs. Tuggs, flinging open the door of the little
      parlour and disclosing Miss Tuggs in perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From the Temple!' said Miss Tuggs and Mr. Simon Tuggs at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From the Temple!' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs, turning as pale as a Dutch
      cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From the Temple,' repeated the man with the bag; 'from Mr. Cower's, the
      solicitor's. Mr. Tuggs, I congratulate you, sir. Ladies, I wish you joy of
      your prosperity! We have been successful.' And the man with the bag
      leisurely divested himself of his umbrella and glove, as a preliminary to
      shaking hands with Mr. Joseph Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the words 'we have been successful,' had no sooner issued from the
      mouth of the man with the bag, than Mr. Simon Tuggs rose from the tub of
      weekly Dorset, opened his eyes very wide, gasped for breath, made figures
      of eight in the air with his pen, and finally fell into the arms of his
      anxious mother, and fainted away without the slightest ostensible cause or
      pretence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Water!' screamed Mrs. Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look up, my son,' exclaimed Mr. Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Simon! dear Simon!' shrieked Miss Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm better now,' said Mr. Simon Tuggs. 'What! successful!' And then, as
      corroborative evidence of his being better, he fainted away again, and was
      borne into the little parlour by the united efforts of the remainder of
      the family, and the man with the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a casual spectator, or to any one unacquainted with the position of the
      family, this fainting would have been unaccountable. To those who
      understood the mission of the man with the bag, and were moreover
      acquainted with the excitability of the nerves of Mr. Simon Tuggs, it was
      quite comprehensible. A long-pending lawsuit respecting the validity of a
      will, had been unexpectedly decided; and Mr. Joseph Tuggs was the
      possessor of twenty thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prolonged consultation took place, that night, in the little parlour-a
      consultation that was to settle the future destinies of the Tuggses. The
      shop was shut up, at an unusually early hour; and many were the unavailing
      kicks bestowed upon the closed door by applicants for quarterns of sugar,
      or half-quarterns of bread, or penn'orths of pepper, which were to have
      been 'left till Saturday,' but which fortune had decreed were to be left
      alone altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must certainly give up business,' said Miss Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, decidedly,' said Mrs. Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Simon shall go to the bar,' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I shall always sign myself "Cymon" in future,' said his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I shall call myself Charlotta,' said Miss Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you must always call me "Ma," and father "Pa,"' said Mrs. Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, and Pa must leave off all his vulgar habits,' interposed Miss Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll take care of all that,' responded Mr. Joseph Tuggs, complacently. He
      was, at that very moment, eating pickled salmon with a pocket-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must leave town immediately,' said Mr. Cymon Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody concurred that this was an indispensable preliminary to being
      genteel. The question then arose, Where should they go?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gravesend?' mildly suggested Mr. Joseph Tuggs. The idea was unanimously
      scouted. Gravesend was low.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Margate?' insinuated Mrs. Tuggs. Worse and worse-nobody there, but
      tradespeople.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Brighton?' Mr. Cymon Tuggs opposed an insurmountable objection. All the
      coaches had been upset, in turn, within the last three weeks; each coach
      had averaged two passengers killed, and six wounded; and, in every case,
      the newspapers had distinctly understood that 'no blame whatever was
      attributable to the coachman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ramsgate?' ejaculated Mr. Cymon, thoughtfully. To be sure; how stupid
      they must have been, not to have thought of that before! Ramsgate was just
      the place of all others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months after this conversation, the City of London Ramsgate steamer
      was running gaily down the river. Her flag was flying, her band was
      playing, her passengers were conversing; everything about her seemed gay
      and lively.-No wonder-the Tuggses were on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charming, ain't it?' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs, in a bottle-green great-
      coat, with a velvet collar of the same, and a blue travelling-cap with a
      gold band.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Soul-inspiring,' replied Mr. Cymon Tuggs-he was entered at the bar.
      'Soul-inspiring!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Delightful morning, sir!' said a stoutish, military-looking gentleman in
      a blue surtout buttoned up to his chin, and white trousers chained down to
      the soles of his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cymon Tuggs took upon himself the responsibility of answering the
      observation. 'Heavenly!' he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are an enthusiastic admirer of the beauties of Nature, sir?' said the
      military gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am, sir,' replied Mr. Cymon Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Travelled much, sir?' inquired the military gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not much,' replied Mr. Cymon Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've been on the continent, of course?' inquired the military
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not exactly,' replied Mr. Cymon Tuggs-in a qualified tone, as if he
      wished it to be implied that he had gone half-way and come back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You of course intend your son to make the grand tour, sir?' said the
      military gentleman, addressing Mr. Joseph Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Joseph Tuggs did not precisely understand what the grand tour was,
      or how such an article was manufactured, he replied, 'Of course.' Just as
      he said the word, there came tripping up, from her seat at the stern of
      the vessel, a young lady in a puce-coloured silk cloak, and boots of the
      same; with long black ringlets, large black eyes, brief petticoats, and
      unexceptionable ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Walter, my dear,' said the young lady to the military gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Belinda, my love,' responded the military gentleman to the black-
      eyed young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have you left me alone so long for?' said the young lady. 'I have
      been stared out of countenance by those rude young men.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What! stared at?' exclaimed the military gentleman, with an emphasis
      which made Mr. Cymon Tuggs withdraw his eyes from the young lady's face
      with inconceivable rapidity. 'Which young men-where?' and the military
      gentleman clenched his fist, and glared fearfully on the cigar-smokers
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be calm, Walter, I entreat,' said the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't,' said the military gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do, sir,' interposed Mr. Cymon Tuggs. 'They ain't worth your notice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-no-they are not, indeed,' urged the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will be calm,' said the military gentleman. 'You speak truly, sir. I
      thank you for a timely remonstrance, which may have spared me the guilt of
      manslaughter.' Calming his wrath, the military gentleman wrung Mr. Cymon
      Tuggs by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My sister, sir!' said Mr. Cymon Tuggs; seeing that the military gentleman
      was casting an admiring look towards Miss Charlotta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My wife, ma'am-Mrs. Captain Waters,' said the military gentleman,
      presenting the black-eyed young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My mother, ma'am-Mrs. Tuggs,' said Mr. Cymon. The military gentleman and
      his wife murmured enchanting courtesies; and the Tuggses looked as
      unembarrassed as they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Walter, my dear,' said the black-eyed young lady, after they had sat
      chatting with the Tuggses some half-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my love,' said the military gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you think this gentleman (with an inclination of the head towards
      Mr. Cymon Tuggs) is very much like the Marquis Carriwini?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord bless me, very!' said the military gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It struck me, the moment I saw him,' said the young lady, gazing
      intently, and with a melancholy air, on the scarlet countenance of Mr.
      Cymon Tuggs. Mr. Cymon Tuggs looked at everybody; and finding that
      everybody was looking at him, appeared to feel some temporary difficulty
      in disposing of his eyesight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So exactly the air of the marquis,' said the military gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite extraordinary!' sighed the military gentleman's lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't know the marquis, sir?' inquired the military gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cymon Tuggs stammered a negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you did,' continued Captain Walter Waters, 'you would feel how much
      reason you have to be proud of the resemblance-a most elegant man, with a
      most prepossessing appearance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is-he is indeed!' exclaimed Belinda Waters energetically. As her eye
      caught that of Mr. Cymon Tuggs, she withdrew it from his features in
      bashful confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was highly gratifying to the feelings of the Tuggses; and when,
      in the course of farther conversation, it was discovered that Miss
      Charlotta Tuggs was the fac simile of a titled relative of Mrs. Belinda
      Waters, and that Mrs. Tuggs herself was the very picture of the Dowager
      Duchess of Dobbleton, their delight in the acquisition of so genteel and
      friendly an acquaintance, knew no bounds. Even the dignity of Captain
      Walter Waters relaxed, to that degree, that he suffered himself to be
      prevailed upon by Mr. Joseph Tuggs, to partake of cold pigeon-pie and
      sherry, on deck; and a most delightful conversation, aided by these
      agreeable stimulants, was prolonged, until they ran alongside Ramsgate
      Pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-bye, dear!' said Mrs. Captain Waters to Miss Charlotta Tuggs, just
      before the bustle of landing commenced; 'we shall see you on the sands in
      the morning; and, as we are sure to have found lodgings before then, I
      hope we shall be inseparables for many weeks to come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! I hope so,' said Miss Charlotta Tuggs, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tickets, ladies and gen'lm'n,' said the man on the paddle-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Want a porter, sir?' inquired a dozen men in smock-frocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, my dear!' said Captain Waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-bye!' said Mrs. Captain Waters-'good-bye, Mr. Cymon!' and with a
      pressure of the hand which threw the amiable young man's nerves into a
      state of considerable derangement, Mrs. Captain Waters disappeared among
      the crowd. A pair of puce-coloured boots were seen ascending the steps, a
      white handkerchief fluttered, a black eye gleamed. The Waterses were gone,
      and Mr. Cymon Tuggs was alone in a heartless world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently and abstractedly, did that too sensitive youth follow his revered
      parents, and a train of smock-frocks and wheelbarrows, along the pier,
      until the bustle of the scene around, recalled him to himself. The sun was
      shining brightly; the sea, dancing to its own music, rolled merrily in;
      crowds of people promenaded to and fro; young ladies tittered; old ladies
      talked; nursemaids displayed their charms to the greatest possible
      advantage; and their little charges ran up and down, and to and fro, and
      in and out, under the feet, and between the legs, of the assembled
      concourse, in the most playful and exhilarating manner. There were old
      gentlemen, trying to make out objects through long telescopes; and young
      ones, making objects of themselves in open shirt- collars; ladies,
      carrying about portable chairs, and portable chairs carrying about
      invalids; parties, waiting on the pier for parties who had come by the
      steam-boat; and nothing was to be heard but talking, laughing, welcoming,
      and merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fly, sir?' exclaimed a chorus of fourteen men and six boys, the moment
      Mr. Joseph Tuggs, at the head of his little party, set foot in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's the gen'lm'n at last!' said one, touching his hat with mock
      politeness. 'Werry glad to see you, sir,-been a-waitin' for you these six
      weeks. Jump in, if you please, sir!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nice light fly and a fast trotter, sir,' said another: 'fourteen mile a
      hour, and surroundin' objects rendered inwisible by ex-treme welocity!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Large fly for your luggage, sir,' cried a third. 'Werry large fly here,
      sir-reg'lar bluebottle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's your fly, sir!' shouted another aspiring charioteer, mounting the
      box, and inducing an old grey horse to indulge in some imperfect
      reminiscences of a canter. 'Look at him, sir!-temper of a lamb and haction
      of a steam-ingein!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Resisting even the temptation of securing the services of so valuable a
      quadruped as the last named, Mr. Joseph Tuggs beckoned to the proprietor
      of a dingy conveyance of a greenish hue, lined with faded striped calico;
      and, the luggage and the family having been deposited therein, the animal
      in the shafts, after describing circles in the road for a quarter of an
      hour, at last consented to depart in quest of lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many beds have you got?' screamed Mrs. Tuggs out of the fly, to the
      woman who opened the door of the first house which displayed a bill
      intimating that apartments were to be let within.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many did you want, ma'am?' was, of course, the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Three.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you step in, ma'am?' Down got Mrs. Tuggs. The family were delighted.
      Splendid view of the sea from the front windows-charming! A short pause.
      Back came Mrs. Tuggs again.-One parlour and a mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why the devil didn't they say so at first?' inquired Mr. Joseph Tuggs,
      rather pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't know,' said Mrs. Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wretches!' exclaimed the nervous Cymon. Another bill-another stoppage.
      Same question-same answer-similar result.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do they mean by this?' inquired Mr. Joseph Tuggs, thoroughly out of
      temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't know,' said the placid Mrs. Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Orvis the vay here, sir,' said the driver, by way of accounting for the
      circumstance in a satisfactory manner; and off they went again, to make
      fresh inquiries, and encounter fresh disappointments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had grown dusk when the 'fly'-the rate of whose progress greatly belied
      its name-after climbing up four or five perpendicular hills, stopped
      before the door of a dusty house, with a bay window, from which you could
      obtain a beautiful glimpse of the sea-if you thrust half of your body out
      of it, at the imminent peril of falling into the area. Mrs. Tuggs
      alighted. One ground-floor sitting-room, and three cells with beds in them
      up-stairs. A double-house. Family on the opposite side. Five children
      milk-and-watering in the parlour, and one little boy, expelled for bad
      behaviour, screaming on his back in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the terms?' said Mrs. Tuggs. The mistress of the house was
      considering the expediency of putting on an extra guinea; so, she coughed
      slightly, and affected not to hear the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the terms?' said Mrs. Tuggs, in a louder key.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Five guineas a week, ma'am, with attendance,' replied the lodging-house
      keeper. (Attendance means the privilege of ringing the bell as often as
      you like, for your own amusement.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather dear,' said Mrs. Tuggs. 'Oh dear, no, ma'am!' replied the mistress
      of the house, with a benign smile of pity at the ignorance of manners and
      customs, which the observation betrayed. 'Very cheap!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an authority was indisputable. Mrs. Tuggs paid a week's rent in
      advance, and took the lodgings for a month. In an hour's time, the family
      were seated at tea in their new abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital srimps!' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cymon eyed his father with a rebellious scowl, as he emphatically said
      'Shrimps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, shrimps,' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs. 'Srimps or shrimps, don't
      much matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was pity, blended with malignity, in Mr. Cymon's eye, as he replied,
      'Don't matter, father! What would Captain Waters say, if he heard such
      vulgarity?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or what would dear Mrs. Captain Waters say,' added Charlotta, 'if she saw
      mother-ma, I mean-eating them whole, heads and all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It won't bear thinking of!' ejaculated Mr. Cymon, with a shudder. 'How
      different,' he thought, 'from the Dowager Duchess of Dobbleton!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very pretty woman, Mrs. Captain Waters, is she not, Cymon?' inquired Miss
      Charlotta.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glow of nervous excitement passed over the countenance of Mr. Cymon
      Tuggs, as he replied, 'An angel of beauty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hallo!' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs. 'Hallo, Cymon, my boy, take care. Married
      lady, you know;' and he winked one of his twinkling eyes knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why,' exclaimed Cymon, starting up with an ebullition of fury, as
      unexpected as alarming, 'why am I to be reminded of that blight of my
      happiness, and ruin of my hopes? Why am I to be taunted with the miseries
      which are heaped upon my head? Is it not enough to-to-to-' and the orator
      paused; but whether for want of words, or lack of breath, was never
      distinctly ascertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an impressive solemnity in the tone of this address, and in the
      air with which the romantic Cymon, at its conclusion, rang the bell, and
      demanded a flat candlestick, which effectually forbade a reply. He stalked
      dramatically to bed, and the Tuggses went to bed too, half an hour
      afterwards, in a state of considerable mystification and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the pier had presented a scene of life and bustle to the Tuggses on
      their first landing at Ramsgate, it was far surpassed by the appearance of
      the sands on the morning after their arrival. It was a fine, bright, clear
      day, with a light breeze from the sea. There were the same ladies and
      gentlemen, the same children, the same nursemaids, the same telescopes,
      the same portable chairs. The ladies were employed in needlework, or
      watch-guard making, or knitting, or reading novels; the gentlemen were
      reading newspapers and magazines; the children were digging holes in the
      sand with wooden spades, and collecting water therein; the nursemaids,
      with their youngest charges in their arms, were running in after the
      waves, and then running back with the waves after them; and, now and then,
      a little sailing-boat either departed with a gay and talkative cargo of
      passengers, or returned with a very silent and particularly
      uncomfortable-looking one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I never!' exclaimed Mrs. Tuggs, as she and Mr. Joseph Tuggs, and
      Miss Charlotta Tuggs, and Mr. Cymon Tuggs, with their eight feet in a
      corresponding number of yellow shoes, seated themselves on four rush-
      bottomed chairs, which, being placed in a soft part of the sand, forthwith
      sunk down some two feet and a half-'Well, I never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cymon, by an exertion of great personal strength, uprooted the chairs,
      and removed them further back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I'm blessed if there ain't some ladies a-going in!' exclaimed Mr.
      Joseph Tuggs, with intense astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lor, pa!' exclaimed Miss Charlotta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is, my dear,' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs. And, sure enough, four young
      ladies, each furnished with a towel, tripped up the steps of a
      bathing-machine. In went the horse, floundering about in the water; round
      turned the machine; down sat the driver; and presently out burst the young
      ladies aforesaid, with four distinct splashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that's sing'ler, too!' ejaculated Mr. Joseph Tuggs, after an
      awkward pause. Mr. Cymon coughed slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, here's some gentlemen a-going in on this side!' exclaimed Mrs.
      Tuggs, in a tone of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three machines-three horses-three flounderings-three turnings round-three
      splashes-three gentlemen, disporting themselves in the water like so many
      dolphins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that's sing'ler!' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs again. Miss Charlotta
      coughed this time, and another pause ensued. It was agreeably broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How d'ye do, dear? We have been looking for you, all the morning,' said a
      voice to Miss Charlotta Tuggs. Mrs. Captain Waters was the owner of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How d'ye do?' said Captain Walter Waters, all suavity; and a most cordial
      interchange of greetings ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Belinda, my love,' said Captain Walter Waters, applying his glass to his
      eye, and looking in the direction of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my dear,' replied Mrs. Captain Waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's Harry Thompson!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where?' said Belinda, applying her glass to her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bathing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lor, so it is! He don't see us, does he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I don't think he does' replied the captain. 'Bless my soul, how very
      singular!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?' inquired Belinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's Mary Golding, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lor!-where?' (Up went the glass again.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'There!' said the captain, pointing to one of the young ladies before
      noticed, who, in her bathing costume, looked as if she was enveloped in a
      patent Mackintosh, of scanty dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So it is, I declare!' exclaimed Mrs. Captain Waters. 'How very curious we
      should see them both!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very,' said the captain, with perfect coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the reg'lar thing here, you see,' whispered Mr. Cymon Tuggs to his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see it is,' whispered Mr. Joseph Tuggs in reply. 'Queer, though-ain't
      it?' Mr. Cymon Tuggs nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you think of doing with yourself this morning?' inquired the
      captain. 'Shall we lunch at Pegwell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like that very much indeed,' interposed Mrs. Tuggs. She had
      never heard of Pegwell; but the word 'lunch' had reached her ears, and it
      sounded very agreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How shall we go?' inquired the captain; 'it's too warm to walk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A shay?' suggested Mr. Joseph Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Chaise,' whispered Mr. Cymon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think one would be enough,' said Mr. Joseph Tuggs aloud, quite
      unconscious of the meaning of the correction. 'However, two shays if you
      like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like a donkey so much,' said Belinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, so should I!' echoed Charlotta Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we can have a fly,' suggested the captain, 'and you can have a
      couple of donkeys.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh difficulty arose. Mrs. Captain Waters declared it would be
      decidedly improper for two ladies to ride alone. The remedy was obvious.
      Perhaps young Mr. Tuggs would be gallant enough to accompany them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cymon Tuggs blushed, smiled, looked vacant, and faintly protested that
      he was no horseman. The objection was at once overruled. A fly was
      speedily found; and three donkeys-which the proprietor declared on his
      solemn asseveration to be 'three parts blood, and the other corn'-were
      engaged in the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kim up!' shouted one of the two boys who followed behind, to propel the
      donkeys, when Belinda Waters and Charlotta Tuggs had been hoisted, and
      pushed, and pulled, into their respective saddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hi-hi-hi!' groaned the other boy behind Mr. Cymon Tuggs. Away went the
      donkey, with the stirrups jingling against the heels of Cymon's boots, and
      Cymon's boots nearly scraping the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Way-way! Wo-o-o-!' cried Mr. Cymon Tuggs as well as he could, in the
      midst of the jolting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't make it gallop!' screamed Mrs. Captain Waters, behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My donkey will go into the public-house!' shrieked Miss Tuggs in the
      rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hi-hi-hi!' groaned both the boys together; and on went the donkeys as if
      nothing would ever stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything has an end, however; even the galloping of donkeys will cease
      in time. The animal which Mr. Cymon Tuggs bestrode, feeling sundry
      uncomfortable tugs at the bit, the intent of which he could by no means
      divine, abruptly sidled against a brick wall, and expressed his uneasiness
      by grinding Mr. Cymon Tuggs's leg on the rough surface. Mrs. Captain
      Waters's donkey, apparently under the influence of some playfulness of
      spirit, rushed suddenly, head first, into a hedge, and declined to come
      out again: and the quadruped on which Miss Tuggs was mounted, expressed
      his delight at this humorous proceeding by firmly planting his fore-feet
      against the ground, and kicking up his hind-legs in a very agile, but
      somewhat alarming manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This abrupt termination to the rapidity of the ride, naturally occasioned
      some confusion. Both the ladies indulged in vehement screaming for several
      minutes; and Mr. Cymon Tuggs, besides sustaining intense bodily pain, had
      the additional mental anguish of witnessing their distressing situation,
      without having the power to rescue them, by reason of his leg being firmly
      screwed in between the animal and the wall. The efforts of the boys,
      however, assisted by the ingenious expedient of twisting the tail of the
      most rebellious donkey, restored order in a much shorter time than could
      have reasonably been expected, and the little party jogged slowly on
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now let 'em walk,' said Mr. Cymon Tuggs. 'It's cruel to overdrive 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Werry well, sir,' replied the boy, with a grin at his companion, as if he
      understood Mr. Cymon to mean that the cruelty applied less to the animals
      than to their riders.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a lovely day, dear!' said Charlotta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charming; enchanting, dear!' responded Mrs. Captain Waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a beautiful prospect, Mr. Tuggs!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cymon looked full in Belinda's face, as he responded-'Beautiful, indeed!'
      The lady cast down her eyes, and suffered the animal she was riding to
      fall a little back. Cymon Tuggs instinctively did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence, broken only by a sigh from Mr. Cymon Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Cymon,' said the lady suddenly, in a low tone, 'Mr. Cymon-I am
      another's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cymon expressed his perfect concurrence in a statement which it was
      impossible to controvert.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I had not been-' resumed Belinda; and there she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-what?' said Mr. Cymon earnestly. 'Do not torture me. What would you
      say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I had not been'-continued Mrs. Captain Waters-'if, in earlier life, it
      had been my fate to have known, and been beloved by, a noble youth-a
      kindred soul-a congenial spirit-one capable of feeling and appreciating
      the sentiments which-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heavens! what do I hear?' exclaimed Mr. Cymon Tuggs. 'Is it possible! can
      I believe my-Come up!' (This last unsentimental parenthesis was addressed
      to the donkey, who, with his head between his fore-legs, appeared to be
      examining the state of his shoes with great anxiety.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hi-hi-hi,' said the boys behind. 'Come up,' expostulated Cymon Tuggs
      again. 'Hi-hi-hi,' repeated the boys. And whether it was that the animal
      felt indignant at the tone of Mr. Tuggs's command, or felt alarmed by the
      noise of the deputy proprietor's boots running behind him; or whether he
      burned with a noble emulation to outstrip the other donkeys; certain it is
      that he no sooner heard the second series of 'hi-hi's,' than he started
      away, with a celerity of pace which jerked Mr. Cymon's hat off,
      instantaneously, and carried him to the Pegwell Bay hotel in no time,
      where he deposited his rider without giving him the trouble of
      dismounting, by sagaciously pitching him over his head, into the very
      doorway of the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was the confusion of Mr. Cymon Tuggs, when he was put right end
      uppermost, by two waiters; considerable was the alarm of Mrs. Tuggs in
      behalf of her son; agonizing were the apprehensions of Mrs. Captain Waters
      on his account. It was speedily discovered, however, that he had not
      sustained much more injury than the donkey-he was grazed, and the animal
      was grazing-and then it was a delightful party to be sure! Mr. and Mrs.
      Tuggs, and the captain, had ordered lunch in the little garden
      behind:-small saucers of large shrimps, dabs of butter, crusty loaves, and
      bottled ale. The sky was without a cloud; there were flower-pots and turf
      before them; the sea, from the foot of the cliff, stretching away as far
      as the eye could discern anything at all; vessels in the distance with
      sails as white, and as small, as nicely-got-up cambric handkerchiefs. The
      shrimps were delightful, the ale better, and the captain even more
      pleasant than either. Mrs. Captain Waters was in such spirits after
      lunch!-chasing, first the captain across the turf, and among the
      flower-pots; and then Mr. Cymon Tuggs; and then Miss Tuggs; and laughing,
      too, quite boisterously. But as the captain said, it didn't matter; who
      knew what they were, there? For all the people of the house knew, they
      might be common people. To which Mr. Joseph Tuggs responded, 'To be sure.'
      And then they went down the steep wooden steps a little further on, which
      led to the bottom of the cliff; and looked at the crabs, and the seaweed,
      and the eels, till it was more than fully time to go back to Ramsgate
      again. Finally, Mr. Cymon Tuggs ascended the steps last, and Mrs. Captain
      Waters last but one; and Mr. Cymon Tuggs discovered that the foot and
      ankle of Mrs. Captain Waters, were even more unexceptionable than he had
      at first supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a donkey towards his ordinary place of residence, is a very
      different thing, and a feat much more easily to be accomplished, than
      taking him from it. It requires a great deal of foresight and presence of
      mind in the one case, to anticipate the numerous flights of his discursive
      imagination; whereas, in the other, all you have to do, is, to hold on,
      and place a blind confidence in the animal. Mr. Cymon Tuggs adopted the
      latter expedient on his return; and his nerves were so little discomposed
      by the journey, that he distinctly understood they were all to meet again
      at the library in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library was crowded. There were the same ladies, and the same
      gentlemen, who had been on the sands in the morning, and on the pier the
      day before. There were young ladies, in maroon-coloured gowns and black
      velvet bracelets, dispensing fancy articles in the shop, and presiding
      over games of chance in the concert-room. There were marriageable
      daughters, and marriage-making mammas, gaming and promenading, and turning
      over music, and flirting. There were some male beaux doing the sentimental
      in whispers, and others doing the ferocious in moustache. There were Mrs.
      Tuggs in amber, Miss Tuggs in sky-blue, Mrs. Captain Waters in pink. There
      was Captain Waters in a braided surtout; there was Mr. Cymon Tuggs in
      pumps and a gilt waistcoat; there was Mr. Joseph Tuggs in a blue coat and
      a shirt-frill.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Numbers three, eight, and eleven!' cried one of the young ladies in the
      maroon-coloured gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Numbers three, eight, and eleven!' echoed another young lady in the same
      uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Number three's gone,' said the first young lady. 'Numbers eight and
      eleven!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Numbers eight and eleven!' echoed the second young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Number eight's gone, Mary Ann,' said the first young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Number eleven!' screamed the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The numbers are all taken now, ladies, if you please,' said the first.
      The representatives of numbers three, eight, and eleven, and the rest of
      the numbers, crowded round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you throw, ma'am?' said the presiding goddess, handing the dice- box
      to the eldest daughter of a stout lady, with four girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a profound silence among the lookers-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Throw, Jane, my dear,' said the stout lady. An interesting display of
      bashfulness-a little blushing in a cambric handkerchief-a whispering to a
      younger sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Amelia, my dear, throw for your sister,' said the stout lady; and then
      she turned to a walking advertisement of Rowlands' Macassar Oil, who stood
      next her, and said, 'Jane is so very modest and retiring; but I can't be
      angry with her for it. An artless and unsophisticated girl is so truly
      amiable, that I often wish Amelia was more like her sister!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman with the whiskers whispered his admiring approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, my dear!' said the stout lady. Miss Amelia threw-eight for her
      sister, ten for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nice figure, Amelia,' whispered the stout lady to a thin youth beside
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Beautiful!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And such a spirit! I am like you in that respect. I can not help admiring
      that life and vivacity. Ah! (a sigh) I wish I could make poor Jane a
      little more like my dear Amelia!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman cordially acquiesced in the sentiment; both he, and
      the individual first addressed, were perfectly contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's this?' inquired Mr. Cymon Tuggs of Mrs. Captain Waters, as a short
      female, in a blue velvet hat and feathers, was led into the orchestra, by
      a fat man in black tights and cloudy Berlins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Tippin, of the London theatres,' replied Belinda, referring to the
      programme of the concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talented Tippin having condescendingly acknowledged the clapping of
      hands, and shouts of 'bravo!' which greeted her appearance, proceeded to
      sing the popular cavatina of 'Bid me discourse,' accompanied on the piano
      by Mr. Tippin; after which, Mr. Tippin sang a comic song, accompanied on
      the piano by Mrs. Tippin: the applause consequent upon which, was only to
      be exceeded by the enthusiastic approbation bestowed upon an air with
      variations on the guitar, by Miss Tippin, accompanied on the chin by
      Master Tippin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed the evening; thus passed the days and evenings of the Tuggses,
      and the Waterses, for six weeks. Sands in the morning-donkeys at noon-pier
      in the afternoon-library at night-and the same people everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that very night six weeks, the moon was shining brightly over the calm
      sea, which dashed against the feet of the tall gaunt cliffs, with just
      enough noise to lull the old fish to sleep, without disturbing the young
      ones, when two figures were discernible-or would have been, if anybody had
      looked for them-seated on one of the wooden benches which are stationed
      near the verge of the western cliff. The moon had climbed higher into the
      heavens, by two hours' journeying, since those figures first sat down-and
      yet they had moved not. The crowd of loungers had thinned and dispersed;
      the noise of itinerant musicians had died away; light after light had
      appeared in the windows of the different houses in the distance;
      blockade-man after blockade-man had passed the spot, wending his way
      towards his solitary post; and yet those figures had remained stationary.
      Some portions of the two forms were in deep shadow, but the light of the
      moon fell strongly on a puce-coloured boot and a glazed stock. Mr. Cymon
      Tuggs and Mrs. Captain Waters were seated on that bench. They spoke not,
      but were silently gazing on the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Walter will return to-morrow,' said Mrs. Captain Waters, mournfully
      breaking silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cymon Tuggs sighed like a gust of wind through a forest of gooseberry
      bushes, as he replied, 'Alas! he will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Cymon!' resumed Belinda, 'the chaste delight, the calm happiness, of
      this one week of Platonic love, is too much for me!' Cymon was about to
      suggest that it was too little for him, but he stopped himself, and
      murmured unintelligibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And to think that even this gleam of happiness, innocent as it is,'
      exclaimed Belinda, 'is now to be lost for ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, do not say for ever, Belinda,' exclaimed the excitable Cymon, as two
      strongly-defined tears chased each other down his pale face-it was so long
      that there was plenty of room for a chase. 'Do not say for ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must,' replied Belinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' urged Cymon, 'oh why? Such Platonic acquaintance as ours is so
      harmless, that even your husband can never object to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My husband!' exclaimed Belinda. 'You little know him. Jealous and
      revengeful; ferocious in his revenge-a maniac in his jealousy! Would you
      be assassinated before my eyes?' Mr. Cymon Tuggs, in a voice broken by
      emotion, expressed his disinclination to undergo the process of
      assassination before the eyes of anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then leave me,' said Mrs. Captain Waters. 'Leave me, this night, for
      ever. It is late: let us return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cymon Tuggs sadly offered the lady his arm, and escorted her to her
      lodgings. He paused at the door-he felt a Platonic pressure of his hand.
      'Good night,' he said, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good night,' sobbed the lady. Mr. Cymon Tuggs paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you walk in, sir?' said the servant. Mr. Tuggs hesitated. Oh, that
      hesitation! He did walk in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good night!' said Mr. Cymon Tuggs again, when he reached the drawing-
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good night!' replied Belinda; 'and, if at any period of my life, I-Hush!'
      The lady paused and stared with a steady gaze of horror, on the ashy
      countenance of Mr. Cymon Tuggs. There was a double knock at the
      street-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is my husband!' said Belinda, as the captain's voice was heard below.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And my family!' added Cymon Tuggs, as the voices of his relatives floated
      up the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The curtain! The curtain!' gasped Mrs. Captain Waters, pointing to the
      window, before which some chintz hangings were closely drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I have done nothing wrong,' said the hesitating Cymon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The curtain!' reiterated the frantic lady: 'you will be murdered.' This
      last appeal to his feelings was irresistible. The dismayed Cymon concealed
      himself behind the curtain with pantomimic suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the captain, Joseph Tuggs, Mrs. Tuggs, and Charlotta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear,' said the captain, 'Lieutenant, Slaughter.' Two iron-shod boots
      and one gruff voice were heard by Mr. Cymon to advance, and acknowledge
      the honour of the introduction. The sabre of the lieutenant rattled
      heavily upon the floor, as he seated himself at the table. Mr. Cymon's
      fears almost overcame his reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The brandy, my dear!' said the captain. Here was a situation! They were
      going to make a night of it! And Mr. Cymon Tuggs was pent up behind the
      curtain and afraid to breathe!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Slaughter,' said the captain, 'a cigar?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. Cymon Tuggs never could smoke without feeling it indispensably
      necessary to retire, immediately, and never could smell smoke without a
      strong disposition to cough. The cigars were introduced; the captain was a
      professed smoker; so was the lieutenant; so was Joseph Tuggs. The
      apartment was small, the door was closed, the smoke powerful: it hung in
      heavy wreaths over the room, and at length found its way behind the
      curtain. Cymon Tuggs held his nose, his mouth, his breath. It was all of
      no use-out came the cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless my soul!' said the captain, 'I beg your pardon, Miss Tuggs. You
      dislike smoking?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no; I don't indeed,' said Charlotta.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It makes you cough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh dear no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You coughed just now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me, Captain Waters! Lor! how can you say so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Somebody coughed,' said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I certainly thought so,' said Slaughter. No; everybody denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fancy,' said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Must be,' echoed Slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cigars resumed-more smoke-another cough-smothered, but violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Damned odd!' said the captain, staring about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sing'ler!' ejaculated the unconscious Mr. Joseph Tuggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Slaughter looked first at one person mysteriously, then at
      another: then, laid down his cigar, then approached the window on tiptoe,
      and pointed with his right thumb over his shoulder, in the direction of
      the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Slaughter!' ejaculated the captain, rising from table, 'what do you
      mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant, in reply, drew back the curtain and discovered Mr. Cymon
      Tuggs behind it: pallid with apprehension, and blue with wanting to cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aha!' exclaimed the captain, furiously. 'What do I see? Slaughter, your
      sabre!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cymon!' screamed the Tuggses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mercy!' said Belinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Platonic!' gasped Cymon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your sabre!' roared the captain: 'Slaughter-unhand me-the villain's
      life!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Murder!' screamed the Tuggses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hold him fast, sir!' faintly articulated Cymon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Water!' exclaimed Joseph Tuggs-and Mr. Cymon Tuggs and all the ladies
      forthwith fainted away, and formed a tableau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most willingly would we conceal the disastrous termination of the six
      weeks' acquaintance. A troublesome form, and an arbitrary custom, however,
      prescribe that a story should have a conclusion, in addition to a
      commencement; we have therefore no alternative. Lieutenant Slaughter
      brought a message-the captain brought an action. Mr. Joseph Tuggs
      interposed-the lieutenant negotiated. When Mr. Cymon Tuggs recovered from
      the nervous disorder into which misplaced affection, and exciting
      circumstances, had plunged him, he found that his family had lost their
      pleasant acquaintance; that his father was minus fifteen hundred pounds;
      and the captain plus the precise sum. The money was paid to hush the
      matter up, but it got abroad notwithstanding; and there are not wanting
      some who affirm that three designing impostors never found more easy
      dupes, than did Captain Waters, Mrs. Waters, and Lieutenant Slaughter, in
      the Tuggses at Ramsgate.

      CHAPTER V-HORATIO SPARKINS
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Indeed, my love, he paid Teresa very great attention on the last assembly
      night,' said Mrs. Malderton, addressing her spouse, who, after the
      fatigues of the day in the City, was sitting with a silk handkerchief over
      his head, and his feet on the fender, drinking his port;-'very great
      attention; and I say again, every possible encouragement ought to be given
      him. He positively must be asked down here to dine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who must?' inquired Mr. Malderton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, you know whom I mean, my dear-the young man with the black whiskers
      and the white cravat, who has just come out at our assembly, and whom all
      the girls are talking about. Young-dear me! what's his name?-Marianne,
      what is his name?' continued Mrs. Malderton, addressing her youngest
      daughter, who was engaged in netting a purse, and looking sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Horatio Sparkins, ma,' replied Miss Marianne, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! yes, to be sure-Horatio Sparkins,' said Mrs. Malderton. 'Decidedly
      the most gentleman-like young man I ever saw. I am sure in the
      beautifully-made coat he wore the other night, he looked like-like-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like Prince Leopold, ma-so noble, so full of sentiment!' suggested
      Marianne, in a tone of enthusiastic admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You should recollect, my dear,' resumed Mrs. Malderton, 'that Teresa is
      now eight-and-twenty; and that it really is very important that something
      should be done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Teresa Malderton was a very little girl, rather fat, with vermilion
      cheeks, but good-humoured, and still disengaged, although, to do her
      justice, the misfortune arose from no lack of perseverance on her part. In
      vain had she flirted for ten years; in vain had Mr. and Mrs. Malderton
      assiduously kept up an extensive acquaintance among the young eligible
      bachelors of Camberwell, and even of Wandsworth and Brixton; to say
      nothing of those who 'dropped in' from town. Miss Malderton was as well
      known as the lion on the top of Northumberland House, and had an equal
      chance of 'going off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am quite sure you'd like him,' continued Mrs. Malderton, 'he is so
      gentlemanly!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So clever!' said Miss Marianne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And has such a flow of language!' added Miss Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has a great respect for you, my dear,' said Mrs. Malderton to her
      husband. Mr. Malderton coughed, and looked at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes I'm sure he's very much attached to pa's society,' said Miss
      Marianne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt of it,' echoed Miss Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed, he said as much to me in confidence,' observed Mrs. Malderton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well,' returned Mr. Malderton, somewhat flattered; 'if I see him at
      the assembly to-morrow, perhaps I'll ask him down. I hope he knows we live
      at Oak Lodge, Camberwell, my dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course-and that you keep a one-horse carriage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll see about it,' said Mr. Malderton, composing himself for a nap;
      'I'll see about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Malderton was a man whose whole scope of ideas was limited to Lloyd's,
      the Exchange, the India House, and the Bank. A few successful speculations
      had raised him from a situation of obscurity and comparative poverty, to a
      state of affluence. As frequently happens in such cases, the ideas of
      himself and his family became elevated to an extraordinary pitch as their
      means increased; they affected fashion, taste, and many other fooleries,
      in imitation of their betters, and had a very decided and becoming horror
      of anything which could, by possibility, be considered low. He was
      hospitable from ostentation, illiberal from ignorance, and prejudiced from
      conceit. Egotism and the love of display induced him to keep an excellent
      table: convenience, and a love of good things of this life, ensured him
      plenty of guests. He liked to have clever men, or what he considered such,
      at his table, because it was a great thing to talk about; but he never
      could endure what he called 'sharp fellows.' Probably, he cherished this
      feeling out of compliment to his two sons, who gave their respected parent
      no uneasiness in that particular. The family were ambitious of forming
      acquaintances and connexions in some sphere of society superior to that in
      which they themselves moved; and one of the necessary consequences of this
      desire, added to their utter ignorance of the world beyond their own small
      circle, was, that any one who could lay claim to an acquaintance with
      people of rank and title, had a sure passport to the table at Oak Lodge,
      Camberwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of Mr. Horatio Sparkins at the assembly, had excited no
      small degree of surprise and curiosity among its regular frequenters. Who
      could he be? He was evidently reserved, and apparently melancholy. Was he
      a clergyman?-He danced too well. A barrister?-He said he was not called.
      He used very fine words, and talked a great deal. Could he be a
      distinguished foreigner, come to England for the purpose of describing the
      country, its manners and customs; and frequenting public balls and public
      dinners, with the view of becoming acquainted with high life, polished
      etiquette, and English refinement?-No, he had not a foreign accent. Was he
      a surgeon, a contributor to the magazines, a writer of fashionable novels,
      or an artist?-No; to each and all of these surmises, there existed some
      valid objection.-'Then,' said everybody, 'he must be somebody.'-'I should
      think he must be,' reasoned Mr. Malderton, within himself, 'because he
      perceives our superiority, and pays us so much attention.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The night succeeding the conversation we have just recorded, was 'assembly
      night.' The double-fly was ordered to be at the door of Oak Lodge at nine
      o'clock precisely. The Miss Maldertons were dressed in sky-blue satin
      trimmed with artificial flowers; and Mrs. M. (who was a little fat woman),
      in ditto ditto, looked like her eldest daughter multiplied by two. Mr.
      Frederick Malderton, the eldest son, in full- dress costume, was the very
      beau idACal of a smart waiter; and Mr. Thomas Malderton, the youngest,
      with his white dress-stock, blue coat, bright buttons, and red
      watch-ribbon, strongly resembled the portrait of that interesting, but
      rash young gentleman, George Barnwell. Every member of the party had made
      up his or her mind to cultivate the acquaintance of Mr. Horatio Sparkins.
      Miss Teresa, of course, was to be as amiable and interesting as ladies of
      eight-and-twenty on the look-out for a husband, usually are. Mrs.
      Malderton would be all smiles and graces. Miss Marianne would request the
      favour of some verses for her album. Mr. Malderton would patronise the
      great unknown by asking him to dinner. Tom intended to ascertain the
      extent of his information on the interesting topics of snuff and cigars.
      Even Mr. Frederick Malderton himself, the family authority on all points
      of taste, dress, and fashionable arrangement; who had lodgings of his own
      in town; who had a free admission to Covent-garden theatre; who always
      dressed according to the fashions of the months; who went up the water
      twice a-week in the season; and who actually had an intimate friend who
      once knew a gentleman who formerly lived in the Albany,-even he had
      determined that Mr. Horatio Sparkins must be a devilish good fellow, and
      that he would do him the honour of challenging him to a game at billiards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first object that met the anxious eyes of the expectant family on
      their entrance into the ball-room, was the interesting Horatio, with his
      hair brushed off his forehead, and his eyes fixed on the ceiling,
      reclining in a contemplative attitude on one of the seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There he is, my dear,' whispered Mrs. Malderton to Mr. Malderton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How like Lord Byron!' murmured Miss Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or Montgomery!' whispered Miss Marianne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or the portraits of Captain Cook!' suggested Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tom-don't be an ass!' said his father, who checked him on all occasions,
      probably with a view to prevent his becoming 'sharp'-which was very
      unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elegant Sparkins attitudinised with admirable effect, until the family
      had crossed the room. He then started up, with the most natural appearance
      of surprise and delight; accosted Mrs. Malderton with the utmost
      cordiality; saluted the young ladies in the most enchanting manner; bowed
      to, and shook hands with Mr. Malderton, with a degree of respect amounting
      almost to veneration; and returned the greetings of the two young men in a
      half-gratified, half-patronising manner, which fully convinced them that
      he must be an important, and, at the same time, condescending personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Malderton,' said Horatio, after the ordinary salutations, and bowing
      very low, 'may I be permitted to presume to hope that you will allow me to
      have the pleasure-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think I am engaged,' said Miss Teresa, with a dreadful
      affectation of indifference-'but, really-so many-'
    </p>
    <p>
      Horatio looked handsomely miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be most happy,' simpered the interesting Teresa, at last.
      Horatio's countenance brightened up, like an old hat in a shower of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very genteel young man, certainly!' said the gratified Mr. Malderton,
      as the obsequious Sparkins and his partner joined the quadrille which was
      just forming.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has a remarkably good address,' said Mr. Frederick.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, he is a prime fellow,' interposed Tom, who always managed to put his
      foot in it-'he talks just like an auctioneer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tom!' said his father solemnly, 'I think I desired you, before, not to be
      a fool.' Tom looked as happy as a cock on a drizzly morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How delightful!' said the interesting Horatio to his partner, as they
      promenaded the room at the conclusion of the set-'how delightful, how
      refreshing it is, to retire from the cloudy storms, the vicissitudes, and
      the troubles, of life, even if it be but for a few short fleeting moments:
      and to spend those moments, fading and evanescent though they be, in the
      delightful, the blessed society of one individual-whose frowns would be
      death, whose coldness would be madness, whose falsehood would be ruin,
      whose constancy would be bliss; the possession of whose affection would be
      the brightest and best reward that Heaven could bestow on man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What feeling! what sentiment!' thought Miss Teresa, as she leaned more
      heavily on her companion's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But enough-enough!' resumed the elegant Sparkins, with a theatrical air.
      'What have I said? what have I-I-to do with sentiments like these! Miss
      Malderton'-here he stopped short-'may I hope to be permitted to offer the
      humble tribute of-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really, Mr. Sparkins,' returned the enraptured Teresa, blushing in the
      sweetest confusion, 'I must refer you to papa. I never can, without his
      consent, venture to-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely he cannot object-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed, you know him not!' interrupted Miss Teresa, well
      knowing there was nothing to fear, but wishing to make the interview
      resemble a scene in some romantic novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He cannot object to my offering you a glass of negus,' returned the
      adorable Sparkins, with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that all?' thought the disappointed Teresa. 'What a fuss about
      nothing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will give me the greatest pleasure, sir, to see you to dinner at Oak
      Lodge, Camberwell, on Sunday next at five o'clock, if you have no better
      engagement,' said Mr. Malderton, at the conclusion of the evening, as he
      and his sons were standing in conversation with Mr. Horatio Sparkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horatio bowed his acknowledgments, and accepted the flattering invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must confess,' continued the father, offering his snuff-box to his new
      acquaintance, 'that I don't enjoy these assemblies half so much as the
      comfort-I had almost said the luxury-of Oak Lodge. They have no great
      charms for an elderly man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And after all, sir, what is man?' said the metaphysical Sparkins. 'I say,
      what is man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! very true,' said Mr. Malderton; 'very true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We know that we live and breathe,' continued Horatio; 'that we have wants
      and wishes, desires and appetites-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' said Mr. Frederick Malderton, looking profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say, we know that we exist,' repeated Horatio, raising his voice, 'but
      there we stop; there, is an end to our knowledge; there, is the summit of
      our attainments; there, is the termination of our ends. What more do we
      know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing,' replied Mr. Frederick-than whom no one was more capable of
      answering for himself in that particular. Tom was about to hazard
      something, but, fortunately for his reputation, he caught his father's
      angry eye, and slunk off like a puppy convicted of petty larceny.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my word,' said Mr. Malderton the elder, as they were returning home
      in the fly, 'that Mr. Sparkins is a wonderful young man. Such surprising
      knowledge! such extraordinary information! and such a splendid mode of
      expressing himself!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think he must be somebody in disguise,' said Miss Marianne. 'How
      charmingly romantic!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He talks very loud and nicely,' timidly observed Tom, 'but I don't
      exactly understand what he means.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I almost begin to despair of your understanding anything, Tom,' said his
      father, who, of course, had been much enlightened by Mr. Horatio
      Sparkins's conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It strikes me, Tom,' said Miss Teresa, 'that you have made yourself very
      ridiculous this evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt of it,' cried everybody-and the unfortunate Tom reduced himself
      into the least possible space. That night, Mr. and Mrs. Malderton had a
      long conversation respecting their daughter's prospects and future
      arrangements. Miss Teresa went to bed, considering whether, in the event
      of her marrying a title, she could conscientiously encourage the visits of
      her present associates; and dreamed, all night, of disguised noblemen,
      large routs, ostrich plumes, bridal favours, and Horatio Sparkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various surmises were hazarded on the Sunday morning, as to the mode of
      conveyance which the anxiously-expected Horatio would adopt. Did he keep a
      gig?-was it possible he could come on horseback?-or would he patronize the
      stage? These, and other various conjectures of equal importance, engrossed
      the attention of Mrs. Malderton and her daughters during the whole morning
      after church.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my word, my dear, it's a most annoying thing that that vulgar
      brother of yours should have invited himself to dine here to-day,' said
      Mr. Malderton to his wife. 'On account of Mr. Sparkins's coming down, I
      purposely abstained from asking any one but Flamwell. And then to think of
      your brother-a tradesman-it's insufferable! I declare I wouldn't have him
      mention his shop, before our new guest-no, not for a thousand pounds! I
      wouldn't care if he had the good sense to conceal the disgrace he is to
      the family; but he's so fond of his horrible business, that he will let
      people know what he is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jacob Barton, the individual alluded to, was a large grocer; so
      vulgar, and so lost to all sense of feeling, that he actually never
      scrupled to avow that he wasn't above his business: 'he'd made his money
      by it, and he didn't care who know'd it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! Flamwell, my dear fellow, how d'ye do?' said Mr. Malderton, as a
      little spoffish man, with green spectacles, entered the room. 'You got my
      note?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I did; and here I am in consequence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't happen to know this Mr. Sparkins by name? You know everybody?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flamwell was one of those gentlemen of remarkably extensive
      information whom one occasionally meets in society, who pretend to know
      everybody, but in reality know nobody. At Malderton's, where any stories
      about great people were received with a greedy ear, he was an especial
      favourite; and, knowing the kind of people he had to deal with, he carried
      his passion of claiming acquaintance with everybody, to the most
      immoderate length. He had rather a singular way of telling his greatest
      lies in a parenthesis, and with an air of self-denial, as if he feared
      being thought egotistical.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, no, I don't know him by that name,' returned Flamwell, in a low
      tone, and with an air of immense importance. 'I have no doubt I know him,
      though. Is he tall?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Middle-sized,' said Miss Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      'With black hair?' inquired Flamwell, hazarding a bold guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' returned Miss Teresa, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather a snub nose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said the disappointed Teresa, 'he has a Roman nose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I said a Roman nose, didn't I?' inquired Flamwell. 'He's an elegant young
      man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With remarkably prepossessing manners?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes!' said all the family together. 'You must know him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I thought you knew him, if he was anybody,' triumphantly exclaimed
      Mr. Malderton. 'Who d'ye think he is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, from your description,' said Flamwell, ruminating, and sinking his
      voice, almost to a whisper, 'he bears a strong resemblance to the
      Honourable Augustus Fitz-Edward Fitz-John Fitz-Osborne. He's a very
      talented young man, and rather eccentric. It's extremely probable he may
      have changed his name for some temporary purpose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa's heart beat high. Could he be the Honourable Augustus Fitz- Edward
      Fitz-John Fitz-Osborne! What a name to be elegantly engraved upon two
      glazed cards, tied together with a piece of white satin ribbon! 'The
      Honourable Mrs. Augustus Fitz-Edward Fitz-John Fitz-Osborne!' The thought
      was transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's five minutes to five,' said Mr. Malderton, looking at his watch: 'I
      hope he's not going to disappoint us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There he is!' exclaimed Miss Teresa, as a loud double-knock was heard at
      the door. Everybody endeavoured to look-as people when they particularly
      expect a visitor always do-as if they were perfectly unsuspicious of the
      approach of anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room-door opened-'Mr. Barton!' said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Confound the man!' murmured Malderton. 'Ah! my dear sir, how d'ye do! Any
      news?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why no,' returned the grocer, in his usual bluff manner. 'No, none
      partickler. None that I am much aware of. How d'ye do, gals and boys? Mr.
      Flamwell, sir-glad to see you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's Mr. Sparkins!' said Tom, who had been looking out at the window,
      'on such a black horse!' There was Horatio, sure enough, on a large black
      horse, curvetting and prancing along, like an Astley's supernumerary.
      After a great deal of reining in, and pulling up, with the accompaniments
      of snorting, rearing, and kicking, the animal consented to stop at about a
      hundred yards from the gate, where Mr. Sparkins dismounted, and confided
      him to the care of Mr. Malderton's groom. The ceremony of introduction was
      gone through, in all due form. Mr. Flamwell looked from behind his green
      spectacles at Horatio with an air of mysterious importance; and the
      gallant Horatio looked unutterable things at Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is he the Honourable Mr. Augustus What's-his-name?' whispered Mrs.
      Malderton to Flamwell, as he was escorting her to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, no-at least not exactly,' returned that great authority-'not
      exactly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is he then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush!' said Flamwell, nodding his head with a grave air, importing that
      he knew very well; but was prevented, by some grave reasons of state, from
      disclosing the important secret. It might be one of the ministers making
      himself acquainted with the views of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Sparkins,' said the delighted Mrs. Malderton, 'pray divide the
      ladies. John, put a chair for the gentleman between Miss Teresa and Miss
      Marianne.' This was addressed to a man who, on ordinary occasions, acted
      as half-groom, half-gardener; but who, as it was important to make an
      impression on Mr. Sparkins, had been forced into a white neckerchief and
      shoes, and touched up, and brushed, to look like a second footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was excellent; Horatio was most attentive to Miss Teresa, and
      every one felt in high spirits, except Mr. Malderton, who, knowing the
      propensity of his brother-in-law, Mr. Barton, endured that sort of agony
      which the newspapers inform us is experienced by the surrounding
      neighbourhood when a pot-boy hangs himself in a hay-loft, and which is
      'much easier to be imagined than described.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you seen your friend, Sir Thomas Noland, lately, Flamwell?' inquired
      Mr. Malderton, casting a sidelong look at Horatio, to see what effect the
      mention of so great a man had upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, no-not very lately. I saw Lord Gubbleton the day before yesterday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All! I hope his lordship is very well?' said Malderton, in a tone of the
      greatest interest. It is scarcely necessary to say that, until that
      moment, he had been quite innocent of the existence of such a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, yes; he was very well-very well indeed. He's a devilish good fellow.
      I met him in the City, and had a long chat with him. Indeed, I'm rather
      intimate with him. I couldn't stop to talk to him as long as I could wish,
      though, because I was on my way to a banker's, a very rich man, and a
      member of Parliament, with whom I am also rather, indeed I may say very,
      intimate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know whom you mean,' returned the host, consequentially-in reality
      knowing as much about the matter as Flamwell himself.-'He has a capital
      business.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was touching on a dangerous topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Talking of business,' interposed Mr. Barton, from the centre of the
      table. 'A gentleman whom you knew very well, Malderton, before you made
      that first lucky spec of yours, called at our shop the other day, and-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Barton, may I trouble you for a potato?' interrupted the wretched master
      of the house, hoping to nip the story in the bud.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' returned the grocer, quite insensible of his brother-in-
      law's object-'and he said in a very plain manner-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Floury, if you please,' interrupted Malderton again; dreading the
      termination of the anecdote, and fearing a repetition of the word 'shop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He said, says he,' continued the culprit, after despatching the potato;
      'says he, how goes on your business? So I said, jokingly-you know my
      way-says I, I'm never above my business, and I hope my business will never
      be above me. Ha, ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Sparkins,' said the host, vainly endeavouring to conceal his dismay,
      'a glass of wine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With the utmost pleasure, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Happy to see you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We were talking the other evening,' resumed the host, addressing Horatio,
      partly with the view of displaying the conversational powers of his new
      acquaintance, and partly in the hope of drowning the grocer's stories-'we
      were talking the other night about the nature of man. Your argument struck
      me very forcibly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And me,' said Mr. Frederick. Horatio made a graceful inclination of the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray, what is your opinion of woman, Mr. Sparkins?' inquired Mrs.
      Malderton. The young ladies simpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Man,' replied Horatio, 'man, whether he ranged the bright, gay, flowery
      plains of a second Eden, or the more sterile, barren, and I may say,
      commonplace regions, to which we are compelled to accustom ourselves, in
      times such as these; man, under any circumstances, or in any place-whether
      he were bending beneath the withering blasts of the frigid zone, or
      scorching under the rays of a vertical sun-man, without woman, would
      be-alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am very happy to find you entertain such honourable opinions, Mr.
      Sparkins,' said Mrs. Malderton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I,' added Miss Teresa. Horatio looked his delight, and the young lady
      blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, it's my opinion-' said Mr. Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know what you're going to say,' interposed Malderton, determined not to
      give his relation another opportunity, 'and I don't agree with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What!' inquired the astonished grocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry to differ from you, Barton,' said the host, in as positive a
      manner as if he really were contradicting a position which the other had
      laid down, 'but I cannot give my assent to what I consider a very
      monstrous proposition.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I meant to say-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You never can convince me,' said Malderton, with an air of obstinate
      determination. 'Never.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I,' said Mr. Frederick, following up his father's attack, 'cannot
      entirely agree in Mr. Sparkins's argument.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What!' said Horatio, who became more metaphysical, and more
      argumentative, as he saw the female part of the family listening in
      wondering delight-'what! Is effect the consequence of cause? Is cause the
      precursor of effect?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the point,' said Flamwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure,' said Mr. Malderton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because, if effect is the consequence of cause, and if cause does precede
      effect, I apprehend you are wrong,' added Horatio.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Decidedly,' said the toad-eating Flamwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At least, I apprehend that to be the just and logical deduction?' said
      Sparkins, in a tone of interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt of it,' chimed in Flamwell again. 'It settles the point.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, perhaps it does,' said Mr. Frederick; 'I didn't see it before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't exactly see it now,' thought the grocer; 'but I suppose it's all
      right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How wonderfully clever he is!' whispered Mrs. Malderton to her daughters,
      as they retired to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, he's quite a love!' said both the young ladies together; 'he talks
      like an oracle. He must have seen a great deal of life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen being left to themselves, a pause ensued, during which
      everybody looked very grave, as if they were quite overcome by the
      profound nature of the previous discussion. Flamwell, who had made up his
      mind to find out who and what Mr. Horatio Sparkins really was, first broke
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Excuse me, sir,' said that distinguished personage, 'I presume you have
      studied for the bar? I thought of entering once, myself-indeed, I'm rather
      intimate with some of the highest ornaments of that distinguished
      profession.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'N-no!' said Horatio, with a little hesitation; 'not exactly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you have been much among the silk gowns, or I mistake?' inquired
      Flamwell, deferentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nearly all my life,' returned Sparkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was thus pretty well settled in the mind of Mr. Flamwell. He
      was a young gentleman 'about to be called.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shouldn't like to be a barrister,' said Tom, speaking for the first
      time, and looking round the table to find somebody who would notice the
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one made any reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shouldn't like to wear a wig,' said Tom, hazarding another observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tom, I beg you will not make yourself ridiculous,' said his father. 'Pray
      listen, and improve yourself by the conversation you hear, and don't be
      constantly making these absurd remarks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, father,' replied the unfortunate Tom, who had not spoken a
      word since he had asked for another slice of beef at a quarter-past five
      o'clock, p.m., and it was then eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Tom,' observed his good-natured uncle, 'never mind! I think with
      you. I shouldn't like to wear a wig. I'd rather wear an apron.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Malderton coughed violently. Mr. Barton resumed-'For if a man's above
      his business-'
    </p>
    <p>
      The cough returned with tenfold violence, and did not cease until the
      unfortunate cause of it, in his alarm, had quite forgotten what he
      intended to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Sparkins,' said Flamwell, returning to the charge, 'do you happen to
      know Mr. Delafontaine, of Bedford-square?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have exchanged cards with him; since which, indeed, I have had an
      opportunity of serving him considerably,' replied Horatio, slightly
      colouring; no doubt, at having been betrayed into making the
      acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are very lucky, if you have had an opportunity of obliging that great
      man,' observed Flamwell, with an air of profound respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know who he is,' he whispered to Mr. Malderton, confidentially,
      as they followed Horatio up to the drawing-room. 'It's quite clear,
      however, that he belongs to the law, and that he is somebody of great
      importance, and very highly connected.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt, no doubt,' returned his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the evening passed away most delightfully. Mr. Malderton,
      relieved from his apprehensions by the circumstance of Mr. Barton's
      falling into a profound sleep, was as affable and gracious as possible.
      Miss Teresa played the 'Fall of Paris,' as Mr. Sparkins declared, in a
      most masterly manner, and both of them, assisted by Mr. Frederick, tried
      over glees and trios without number; they having made the pleasing
      discovery that their voices harmonised beautifully. To be sure, they all
      sang the first part; and Horatio, in addition to the slight drawback of
      having no ear, was perfectly innocent of knowing a note of music; still,
      they passed the time very agreeably, and it was past twelve o'clock before
      Mr. Sparkins ordered the mourning-coach- looking steed to be brought
      out-an order which was only complied with, on the distinct understanding
      that he was to repeat his visit on the following Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, perhaps, Mr. Sparkins will form one of our party to-morrow evening?'
      suggested Mrs. M. 'Mr. Malderton intends taking the girls to see the
      pantomime.' Mr. Sparkins bowed, and promised to join the party in box 48,
      in the course of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will not tax you for the morning,' said Miss Teresa, bewitchingly;
      'for ma is going to take us to all sorts of places, shopping. I know that
      gentlemen have a great horror of that employment.' Mr. Sparkins bowed
      again, and declared that he should be delighted, but business of
      importance occupied him in the morning. Flamwell looked at Malderton
      significantly.-'It's term time!' he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o'clock on the following morning, the 'fly' was at the door of
      Oak Lodge, to convey Mrs. Malderton and her daughters on their expedition
      for the day. They were to dine and dress for the play at a friend's house.
      First, driving thither with their band-boxes, they departed on their first
      errand to make some purchases at Messrs. Jones, Spruggins, and Smith's, of
      Tottenham-court-road; after which, they were to go to Redmayne's in
      Bond-street; thence, to innumerable places that no one ever heard of. The
      young ladies beguiled the tediousness of the ride by eulogising Mr.
      Horatio Sparkins, scolding their mamma for taking them so far to save a
      shilling, and wondering whether they should ever reach their destination.
      At length, the vehicle stopped before a dirty- looking ticketed
      linen-draper's shop, with goods of all kinds, and labels of all sorts and
      sizes, in the window. There were dropsical figures of seven with a little
      three-farthings in the corner; 'perfectly invisible to the naked eye;'
      three hundred and fifty thousand ladies' boas, from one shilling and a
      penny halfpenny; real French kid shoes, at two and ninepence per pair;
      green parasols, at an equally cheap rate; and 'every description of
      goods,' as the proprietors said-and they must know best-'fifty per cent.
      under cost price.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lor! ma, what a place you have brought us to!' said Miss Teresa; 'what
      would Mr. Sparkins say if he could see us!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! what, indeed!' said Miss Marianne, horrified at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray be seated, ladies. What is the first article?' inquired the
      obsequious master of the ceremonies of the establishment, who, in his
      large white neckcloth and formal tie, looked like a bad 'portrait of a
      gentleman' in the Somerset-house exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to see some silks,' answered Mrs. Malderton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Directly, ma'am.-Mr. Smith! Where is Mr. Smith?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here, sir,' cried a voice at the back of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray make haste, Mr. Smith,' said the M.C. 'You never are to be found
      when you're wanted, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smith, thus enjoined to use all possible despatch, leaped over the
      counter with great agility, and placed himself before the newly-arrived
      customers. Mrs. Malderton uttered a faint scream; Miss Teresa, who had
      been stooping down to talk to her sister, raised her head, and
      beheld-Horatio Sparkins!
    </p>
    <p>
      'We will draw a veil,' as novel-writers say, over the scene that ensued.
      The mysterious, philosophical, romantic, metaphysical Sparkins-he who, to
      the interesting Teresa, seemed like the embodied idea of the young dukes
      and poetical exquisites in blue silk dressing-gowns, and ditto ditto
      slippers, of whom she had read and dreamed, but had never expected to
      behold, was suddenly converted into Mr. Samuel Smith, the assistant at a
      'cheap shop;' the junior partner in a slippery firm of some three weeks'
      existence. The dignified evanishment of the hero of Oak Lodge, on this
      unexpected recognition, could only be equalled by that of a furtive dog
      with a considerable kettle at his tail. All the hopes of the Maldertons
      were destined at once to melt away, like the lemon ices at a Company's
      dinner; Almack's was still to them as distant as the North Pole; and Miss
      Teresa had as much chance of a husband as Captain Ross had of the
      north-west passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years have elapsed since the occurrence of this dreadful morning. The
      daisies have thrice bloomed on Camberwell-green; the sparrows have thrice
      repeated their vernal chirps in Camberwell-grove; but the Miss Maldertons
      are still unmated. Miss Teresa's case is more desperate than ever; but
      Flamwell is yet in the zenith of his reputation; and the family have the
      same predilection for aristocratic personages, with an increased aversion
      to anything low.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI-THE BLACK VEIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      One winter's evening, towards the close of the year 1800, or within a year
      or two of that time, a young medical practitioner, recently established in
      business, was seated by a cheerful fire in his little parlour, listening
      to the wind which was beating the rain in pattering drops against the
      window, or rumbling dismally in the chimney. The night was wet and cold;
      he had been walking through mud and water the whole day, and was now
      comfortably reposing in his dressing-gown and slippers, more than half
      asleep and less than half awake, revolving a thousand matters in his
      wandering imagination. First, he thought how hard the wind was blowing,
      and how the cold, sharp rain would be at that moment beating in his face,
      if he were not comfortably housed at home. Then, his mind reverted to his
      annual Christmas visit to his native place and dearest friends; he thought
      how glad they would all be to see him, and how happy it would make Rose if
      he could only tell her that he had found a patient at last, and hoped to
      have more, and to come down again, in a few months' time, and marry her,
      and take her home to gladden his lonely fireside, and stimulate him to
      fresh exertions. Then, he began to wonder when his first patient would
      appear, or whether he was destined, by a special dispensation of
      Providence, never to have any patients at all; and then, he thought about
      Rose again, and dropped to sleep and dreamed about her, till the tones of
      her sweet merry voice sounded in his ears, and her soft tiny hand rested
      on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hand upon his shoulder, but it was neither soft nor tiny; its
      owner being a corpulent round-headed boy, who, in consideration of the sum
      of one shilling per week and his food, was let out by the parish to carry
      medicine and messages. As there was no demand for the medicine, however,
      and no necessity for the messages, he usually occupied his unemployed
      hours-averaging fourteen a day-in abstracting peppermint drops, taking
      animal nourishment, and going to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A lady, sir-a lady!' whispered the boy, rousing his master with a shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What lady?' cried our friend, starting up, not quite certain that his
      dream was an illusion, and half expecting that it might be Rose
      herself.-'What lady? Where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There, sir!' replied the boy, pointing to the glass door leading into the
      surgery, with an expression of alarm which the very unusual apparition of
      a customer might have tended to excite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon looked towards the door, and started himself, for an instant,
      on beholding the appearance of his unlooked-for visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a singularly tall woman, dressed in deep mourning, and standing so
      close to the door that her face almost touched the glass. The upper part
      of her figure was carefully muffled in a black shawl, as if for the
      purpose of concealment; and her face was shrouded by a thick black veil.
      She stood perfectly erect, her figure was drawn up to its full height, and
      though the surgeon felt that the eyes beneath the veil were fixed on him,
      she stood perfectly motionless, and evinced, by no gesture whatever, the
      slightest consciousness of his having turned towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you wish to consult me?' he inquired, with some hesitation, holding
      open the door. It opened inwards, and therefore the action did not alter
      the position of the figure, which still remained motionless on the same
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slightly inclined her head, in token of acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray walk in,' said the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure moved a step forward; and then, turning its head in the
      direction of the boy-to his infinite horror-appeared to hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Leave the room, Tom,' said the young man, addressing the boy, whose large
      round eyes had been extended to their utmost width during this brief
      interview. 'Draw the curtain, and shut the door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy drew a green curtain across the glass part of the door, retired
      into the surgery, closed the door after him, and immediately applied one
      of his large eyes to the keyhole on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon drew a chair to the fire, and motioned the visitor to a seat.
      The mysterious figure slowly moved towards it. As the blaze shone upon the
      black dress, the surgeon observed that the bottom of it was saturated with
      mud and rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are very wet,' be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am,' said the stranger, in a low deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you are ill?' added the surgeon, compassionately, for the tone was
      that of a person in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am,' was the reply-'very ill; not bodily, but mentally. It is not for
      myself, or on my own behalf,' continued the stranger, 'that I come to you.
      If I laboured under bodily disease, I should not be out, alone, at such an
      hour, or on such a night as this; and if I were afflicted with it,
      twenty-four hours hence, God knows how gladly I would lie down and pray to
      die. It is for another that I beseech your aid, sir. I may be mad to ask
      it for him-I think I am; but, night after night, through the long dreary
      hours of watching and weeping, the thought has been ever present to my
      mind; and though even I see the hopelessness of human assistance availing
      him, the bare thought of laying him in his grave without it makes my blood
      run cold!' And a shudder, such as the surgeon well knew art could not
      produce, trembled through the speaker's frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a desperate earnestness in this woman's manner, that went to the
      young man's heart. He was young in his profession, and had not yet
      witnessed enough of the miseries which are daily presented before the eyes
      of its members, to have grown comparatively callous to human suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If,' he said, rising hastily, 'the person of whom you speak, be in so
      hopeless a condition as you describe, not a moment is to be lost. I will
      go with you instantly. Why did you not obtain medical advice before?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because it would have been useless before-because it is useless even
      now,' replied the woman, clasping her hands passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon gazed, for a moment, on the black veil, as if to ascertain the
      expression of the features beneath it: its thickness, however, rendered
      such a result impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are ill,' he said, gently, 'although you do not know it. The fever
      which has enabled you to bear, without feeling it, the fatigue you have
      evidently undergone, is burning within you now. Put that to your lips,' he
      continued, pouring out a glass of water-'compose yourself for a few
      moments, and then tell me, as calmly as you can, what the disease of the
      patient is, and how long he has been ill. When I know what it is necessary
      I should know, to render my visit serviceable to him, I am ready to
      accompany you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger lifted the glass of water to her mouth, without raising the
      veil; put it down again untasted; and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know,' she said, sobbing aloud, 'that what I say to you now, seems like
      the ravings of fever. I have been told so before, less kindly than by you.
      I am not a young woman; and they do say, that as life steals on towards
      its final close, the last short remnant, worthless as it may seem to all
      beside, is dearer to its possessor than all the years that have gone
      before, connected though they be with the recollection of old friends long
      since dead, and young ones-children perhaps-who have fallen off from, and
      forgotten one as completely as if they had died too. My natural term of
      life cannot be many years longer, and should be dear on that account; but
      I would lay it down without a sigh-with cheerfulness-with joy-if what I
      tell you now, were only false, or imaginary. To-morrow morning he of whom
      I speak will be, I know, though I would fain think otherwise, beyond the
      reach of human aid; and yet, to-night, though he is in deadly peril, you
      must not see, and could not serve, him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am unwilling to increase your distress,' said the surgeon, after a
      short pause, 'by making any comment on what you have just said, or
      appearing desirous to investigate a subject you are so anxious to conceal;
      but there is an inconsistency in your statement which I cannot reconcile
      with probability. This person is dying to-night, and I cannot see him when
      my assistance might possibly avail; you apprehend it will be useless
      to-morrow, and yet you would have me see him then! If he be, indeed, as
      dear to you, as your words and manner would imply, why not try to save his
      life before delay and the progress of his disease render it
      impracticable?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God help me!' exclaimed the woman, weeping bitterly, 'how can I hope
      strangers will believe what appears incredible, even to myself? You will
      not see him then, sir?' she added, rising suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not say that I declined to see him,' replied the surgeon; 'but I
      warn you, that if you persist in this extraordinary procrastination, and
      the individual dies, a fearful responsibility rests with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The responsibility will rest heavily somewhere,' replied the stranger
      bitterly. 'Whatever responsibility rests with me, I am content to bear,
      and ready to answer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As I incur none,' continued the surgeon, 'by acceding to your request, I
      will see him in the morning, if you leave me the address. At what hour can
      he be seen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nine,' replied the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must excuse my pressing these inquiries,' said the surgeon. 'But is
      he in your charge now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is not,' was the rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, if I gave you instructions for his treatment through the night, you
      could not assist him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman wept bitterly, as she replied, 'I could not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that there was but little prospect of obtaining more information
      by prolonging the interview; and anxious to spare the woman's feelings,
      which, subdued at first by a violent effort, were now irrepressible and
      most painful to witness; the surgeon repeated his promise of calling in
      the morning at the appointed hour. His visitor, after giving him a
      direction to an obscure part of Walworth, left the house in the same
      mysterious manner in which she had entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be readily believed that so extraordinary a visit produced a
      considerable impression on the mind of the young surgeon; and that he
      speculated a great deal and to very little purpose on the possible
      circumstances of the case. In common with the generality of people, he had
      often heard and read of singular instances, in which a presentiment of
      death, at a particular day, or even minute, had been entertained and
      realised. At one moment he was inclined to think that the present might be
      such a case; but, then, it occurred to him that all the anecdotes of the
      kind he had ever heard, were of persons who had been troubled with a
      foreboding of their own death. This woman, however, spoke of another
      person-a man; and it was impossible to suppose that a mere dream or
      delusion of fancy would induce her to speak of his approaching dissolution
      with such terrible certainty as she had spoken. It could not be that the
      man was to be murdered in the morning, and that the woman, originally a
      consenting party, and bound to secrecy by an oath, had relented, and,
      though unable to prevent the commission of some outrage on the victim, had
      determined to prevent his death if possible, by the timely interposition
      of medical aid? The idea of such things happening within two miles of the
      metropolis appeared too wild and preposterous to be entertained beyond the
      instant. Then, his original impression that the woman's intellects were
      disordered, recurred; and, as it was the only mode of solving the
      difficulty with any degree of satisfaction, he obstinately made up his
      mind to believe that she was mad. Certain misgivings upon this point,
      however, stole upon his thoughts at the time, and presented themselves
      again and again through the long dull course of a sleepless night; during
      which, in spite of all his efforts to the contrary, he was unable to
      banish the black veil from his disturbed imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back part of Walworth, at its greatest distance from town, is a
      straggling miserable place enough, even in these days; but, five-and-
      thirty years ago, the greater portion of it was little better than a
      dreary waste, inhabited by a few scattered people of questionable
      character, whose poverty prevented their living in any better
      neighbourhood, or whose pursuits and mode of life rendered its solitude
      desirable. Very many of the houses which have since sprung up on all
      sides, were not built until some years afterwards; and the great majority
      even of those which were sprinkled about, at irregular intervals, were of
      the rudest and most miserable description.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the place through which he walked in the morning, was
      not calculated to raise the spirits of the young surgeon, or to dispel any
      feeling of anxiety or depression which the singular kind of visit he was
      about to make, had awakened. Striking off from the high road, his way lay
      across a marshy common, through irregular lanes, with here and there a
      ruinous and dismantled cottage fast falling to pieces with decay and
      neglect. A stunted tree, or pool of stagnant water, roused into a sluggish
      action by the heavy rain of the preceding night, skirted the path
      occasionally; and, now and then, a miserable patch of garden- ground, with
      a few old boards knocked together for a summer-house, and old palings
      imperfectly mended with stakes pilfered from the neighbouring hedges, bore
      testimony, at once to the poverty of the inhabitants, and the little
      scruple they entertained in appropriating the property of other people to
      their own use. Occasionally, a filthy- looking woman would make her
      appearance from the door of a dirty house, to empty the contents of some
      cooking utensil into the gutter in front, or to scream after a little
      slip-shod girl, who had contrived to stagger a few yards from the door
      under the weight of a sallow infant almost as big as herself; but,
      scarcely anything was stirring around: and so much of the prospect as
      could be faintly traced through the cold damp mist which hung heavily over
      it, presented a lonely and dreary appearance perfectly in keeping with the
      objects we have described.
    </p>
    <p>
      After plodding wearily through the mud and mire; making many inquiries for
      the place to which he had been directed; and receiving as many
      contradictory and unsatisfactory replies in return; the young man at
      length arrived before the house which had been pointed out to him as the
      object of his destination. It was a small low building, one story above
      the ground, with even a more desolate and unpromising exterior than any he
      had yet passed. An old yellow curtain was closely drawn across the window
      up-stairs, and the parlour shutters were closed, but not fastened. The
      house was detached from any other, and, as it stood at an angle of a
      narrow lane, there was no other habitation in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we say that the surgeon hesitated, and walked a few paces beyond the
      house, before he could prevail upon himself to lift the knocker, we say
      nothing that need raise a smile upon the face of the boldest reader. The
      police of London were a very different body in that day; the isolated
      position of the suburbs, when the rage for building and the progress of
      improvement had not yet begun to connect them with the main body of the
      city and its environs, rendered many of them (and this in particular) a
      place of resort for the worst and most depraved characters. Even the
      streets in the gayest parts of London were imperfectly lighted, at that
      time; and such places as these, were left entirely to the mercy of the
      moon and stars. The chances of detecting desperate characters, or of
      tracing them to their haunts, were thus rendered very few, and their
      offences naturally increased in boldness, as the consciousness of
      comparative security became the more impressed upon them by daily
      experience. Added to these considerations, it must be remembered that the
      young man had spent some time in the public hospitals of the metropolis;
      and, although neither Burke nor Bishop had then gained a horrible
      notoriety, his own observation might have suggested to him how easily the
      atrocities to which the former has since given his name, might be
      committed. Be this as it may, whatever reflection made him hesitate, he
      did hesitate: but, being a young man of strong mind and great personal
      courage, it was only for an instant;-he stepped briskly back and knocked
      gently at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low whispering was audible, immediately afterwards, as if some person at
      the end of the passage were conversing stealthily with another on the
      landing above. It was succeeded by the noise of a pair of heavy boots upon
      the bare floor. The door-chain was softly unfastened; the door opened; and
      a tall, ill-favoured man, with black hair, and a face, as the surgeon
      often declared afterwards, as pale and haggard, as the countenance of any
      dead man he ever saw, presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Walk in, sir,' he said in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon did so, and the man having secured the door again, by the
      chain, led the way to a small back parlour at the extremity of the
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Am I in time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too soon!' replied the man. The surgeon turned hastily round, with a
      gesture of astonishment not unmixed with alarm, which he found it
      impossible to repress.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you'll step in here, sir,' said the man, who had evidently noticed the
      action-'if you'll step in here, sir, you won't be detained five minutes, I
      assure you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon at once walked into the room. The man closed the door, and
      left him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little cold room, with no other furniture than two deal chairs,
      and a table of the same material. A handful of fire, unguarded by any
      fender, was burning in the grate, which brought out the damp if it served
      no more comfortable purpose, for the unwholesome moisture was stealing
      down the walls, in long slug-like tracks. The window, which was broken and
      patched in many places, looked into a small enclosed piece of ground,
      almost covered with water. Not a sound was to be heard, either within the
      house, or without. The young surgeon sat down by the fireplace, to await
      the result of his first professional visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not remained in this position many minutes, when the noise of some
      approaching vehicle struck his ear. It stopped; the street-door was
      opened; a low talking succeeded, accompanied with a shuffling noise of
      footsteps, along the passage and on the stairs, as if two or three men
      were engaged in carrying some heavy body to the room above. The creaking
      of the stairs, a few seconds afterwards, announced that the new-comers
      having completed their task, whatever it was, were leaving the house. The
      door was again closed, and the former silence was restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another five minutes had elapsed, and the surgeon had resolved to explore
      the house, in search of some one to whom he might make his errand known,
      when the room-door opened, and his last night's visitor, dressed in
      exactly the same manner, with the veil lowered as before, motioned him to
      advance. The singular height of her form, coupled with the circumstance of
      her not speaking, caused the idea to pass across his brain for an instant,
      that it might be a man disguised in woman's attire. The hysteric sobs
      which issued from beneath the veil, and the convulsive attitude of grief
      of the whole figure, however, at once exposed the absurdity of the
      suspicion; and he hastily followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman led the way up-stairs to the front room, and paused at the door,
      to let him enter first. It was scantily furnished with an old deal box, a
      few chairs, and a tent bedstead, without hangings or cross- rails, which
      was covered with a patchwork counterpane. The dim light admitted through
      the curtain which he had noticed from the outside, rendered the objects in
      the room so indistinct, and communicated to all of them so uniform a hue,
      that he did not, at first, perceive the object on which his eye at once
      rested when the woman rushed frantically past him, and flung herself on
      her knees by the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretched upon the bed, closely enveloped in a linen wrapper, and covered
      with blankets, lay a human form, stiff and motionless. The head and face,
      which were those of a man, were uncovered, save by a bandage which passed
      over the head and under the chin. The eyes were closed. The left arm lay
      heavily across the bed, and the woman held the passive hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon gently pushed the woman aside, and took the hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My God!' he exclaimed, letting it fall involuntarily-'the man is dead!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman started to her feet and beat her hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! don't say so, sir,' she exclaimed, with a burst of passion, amounting
      almost to frenzy. 'Oh! don't say so, sir! I can't bear it! Men have been
      brought to life, before, when unskilful people have given them up for
      lost; and men have died, who might have been restored, if proper means had
      been resorted to. Don't let him lie here, sir, without one effort to save
      him! This very moment life may be passing away. Do try, sir,-do, for
      Heaven's sake!'-And while speaking, she hurriedly chafed, first the
      forehead, and then the breast, of the senseless form before her; and then,
      wildly beat the cold hands, which, when she ceased to hold them, fell
      listlessly and heavily back on the coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is of no use, my good woman,' said the surgeon, soothingly, as he
      withdrew his hand from the man's breast. 'Stay-undraw that curtain!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' said the woman, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Undraw that curtain!' repeated the surgeon in an agitated tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I darkened the room on purpose,' said the woman, throwing herself before
      him as he rose to undraw it.-'Oh! sir, have pity on me! If it can be of no
      use, and he is really dead, do not expose that form to other eyes than
      mine!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This man died no natural or easy death,' said the surgeon. 'I must see
      the body!' With a motion so sudden, that the woman hardly knew that he had
      slipped from beside her, he tore open the curtain, admitted the full light
      of day, and returned to the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There has been violence here,' he said, pointing towards the body, and
      gazing intently on the face, from which the black veil was now, for the
      first time, removed. In the excitement of a minute before, the female had
      thrown off the bonnet and veil, and now stood with her eyes fixed upon
      him. Her features were those of a woman about fifty, who had once been
      handsome. Sorrow and weeping had left traces upon them which not time
      itself would ever have produced without their aid; her face was deadly
      pale; and there was a nervous contortion of the lip, and an unnatural fire
      in her eye, which showed too plainly that her bodily and mental powers had
      nearly sunk, beneath an accumulation of misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There has been violence here,' said the surgeon, preserving his searching
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There has!' replied the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This man has been murdered.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I call God to witness he has,' said the woman, passionately;
      'pitilessly, inhumanly murdered!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By whom?' said the surgeon, seizing the woman by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look at the butchers' marks, and then ask me!' she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon turned his face towards the bed, and bent over the body which
      now lay full in the light of the window. The throat was swollen, and a
      livid mark encircled it. The truth flashed suddenly upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is one of the men who were hanged this morning!' he exclaimed,
      turning away with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is,' replied the woman, with a cold, unmeaning stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who was he?' inquired the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My son,' rejoined the woman; and fell senseless at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. A companion, equally guilty with himself, had been acquitted
      for want of evidence; and this man had been left for death, and executed.
      To recount the circumstances of the case, at this distant period, must be
      unnecessary, and might give pain to some persons still alive. The history
      was an every-day one. The mother was a widow without friends or money, and
      had denied herself necessaries to bestow them on her orphan boy. That boy,
      unmindful of her prayers, and forgetful of the sufferings she had endured
      for him-incessant anxiety of mind, and voluntary starvation of body-had
      plunged into a career of dissipation and crime. And this was the result;
      his own death by the hangman's hands, and his mother's shame, and
      incurable insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years after this occurrence, and when profitable and arduous
      avocations would have led many men to forget that such a miserable being
      existed, the young surgeon was a daily visitor at the side of the harmless
      mad woman; not only soothing her by his presence and kindness, but
      alleviating the rigour of her condition by pecuniary donations for her
      comfort and support, bestowed with no sparing hand. In the transient gleam
      of recollection and consciousness which preceded her death, a prayer for
      his welfare and protection, as fervent as mortal ever breathed, rose from
      the lips of this poor friendless creature. That prayer flew to Heaven, and
      was heard. The blessings he was instrumental in conferring, have been
      repaid to him a thousand-fold; but, amid all the honours of rank and
      station which have since been heaped upon him, and which he has so well
      earned, he can have no reminiscence more gratifying to his heart than that
      connected with The Black Veil.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII-THE STEAM EXCURSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Noakes was a law student, inhabiting a set of chambers on the
      fourth floor, in one of those houses in Gray's-inn-square which command an
      extensive view of the gardens, and their usual adjuncts-flaunting
      nursery-maids, and town-made children, with parenthetical legs. Mr. Percy
      Noakes was what is generally termed-'a devilish good fellow.' He had a
      large circle of acquaintance, and seldom dined at his own expense. He used
      to talk politics to papas, flatter the vanity of mammas, do the amiable to
      their daughters, make pleasure engagements with their sons, and romp with
      the younger branches. Like those paragons of perfection, advertising
      footmen out of place, he was always 'willing to make himself generally
      useful.' If any old lady, whose son was in India, gave a ball, Mr. Percy
      Noakes was master of the ceremonies; if any young lady made a stolen
      match, Mr. Percy Noakes gave her away; if a juvenile wife presented her
      husband with a blooming cherub, Mr. Percy Noakes was either godfather, or
      deputy-godfather; and if any member of a friend's family died, Mr. Percy
      Noakes was invariably to be seen in the second mourning coach, with a
      white handkerchief to his eyes, sobbing-to use his own appropriate and
      expressive description-'like winkin'!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It may readily be imagined that these numerous avocations were rather
      calculated to interfere with Mr. Percy Noakes's professional studies. Mr.
      Percy Noakes was perfectly aware of the fact, and had, therefore, after
      mature reflection, made up his mind not to study at all-a laudable
      determination, to which he adhered in the most praiseworthy manner. His
      sitting-room presented a strange chaos of dress-gloves, boxing-gloves,
      caricatures, albums, invitation-cards, foils, cricket-bats, cardboard
      drawings, paste, gum, and fifty other miscellaneous articles, heaped
      together in the strangest confusion. He was always making something for
      somebody, or planning some party of pleasure, which was his great forte.
      He invariably spoke with astonishing rapidity; was smart, spoffish, and
      eight-and-twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Splendid idea, 'pon my life!' soliloquised Mr. Percy Noakes, over his
      morning coffee, as his mind reverted to a suggestion which had been thrown
      out on the previous night, by a lady at whose house he had spent the
      evening. 'Glorious idea!-Mrs. Stubbs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir,' replied a dirty old woman with an inflamed countenance,
      emerging from the bedroom, with a barrel of dirt and cinders.-This was the
      laundress. 'Did you call, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! Mrs. Stubbs, I'm going out. If that tailor should call again, you'd
      better say-you'd better say I'm out of town, and shan't be back for a
      fortnight; and if that bootmaker should come, tell him I've lost his
      address, or I'd have sent him that little amount. Mind he writes it down;
      and if Mr. Hardy should call-you know Mr. Hardy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The funny gentleman, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! the funny gentleman. If Mr. Hardy should call, say I've gone to Mrs.
      Taunton's about that water-party.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And if any fellow calls, and says he's come about a steamer, tell him to
      be here at five o'clock this afternoon, Mrs. Stubbs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Noakes brushed his hat, whisked the crumbs off his
      inexpressibles with a silk handkerchief, gave the ends of his hair a
      persuasive roll round his forefinger, and sallied forth for Mrs. Taunton's
      domicile in Great Marlborough-street, where she and her daughters occupied
      the upper part of a house. She was a good-looking widow of fifty, with the
      form of a giantess and the mind of a child. The pursuit of pleasure, and
      some means of killing time, were the sole end of her existence. She doted
      on her daughters, who were as frivolous as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general exclamation of satisfaction hailed the arrival of Mr. Percy
      Noakes, who went through the ordinary salutations, and threw himself into
      an easy chair near the ladies' work-table, with the ease of a regularly
      established friend of the family. Mrs. Taunton was busily engaged in
      planting immense bright bows on every part of a smart cap on which it was
      possible to stick one; Miss Emily Taunton was making a watch-guard; Miss
      Sophia was at the piano, practising a new song-poetry by the young
      officer, or the police-officer, or the custom-house officer, or some other
      interesting amateur.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You good creature!' said Mrs. Taunton, addressing the gallant Percy. 'You
      really are a good soul! You've come about the water-party, I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should rather suspect I had,' replied Mr. Noakes, triumphantly. 'Now,
      come here, girls, and I'll tell you all about it.' Miss Emily and Miss
      Sophia advanced to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' continued Mr. Percy Noakes, 'it seems to me that the best way will
      be, to have a committee of ten, to make all the arrangements, and manage
      the whole set-out. Then, I propose that the expenses shall be paid by
      these ten fellows jointly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Excellent, indeed!' said Mrs. Taunton, who highly approved of this part
      of the arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, my plan is, that each of these ten fellows shall have the power of
      asking five people. There must be a meeting of the committee, at my
      chambers, to make all the arrangements, and these people shall be then
      named; every member of the committee shall have the power of black-
      balling any one who is proposed; and one black ball shall exclude that
      person. This will ensure our having a pleasant party, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a manager you are!' interrupted Mrs. Taunton again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charming!' said the lovely Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never did!' ejaculated Sophia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I think it'll do,' replied Mr. Percy Noakes, who was now quite in
      his element. 'I think it'll do. Then you know we shall go down to the
      Nore, and back, and have a regular capital cold dinner laid out in the
      cabin before we start, so that everything may be ready without any
      confusion; and we shall have the lunch laid out, on deck, in those little
      tea-garden-looking concerns by the paddle-boxes-I don't know what you call
      'em. Then, we shall hire a steamer expressly for our party, and a band,
      and have the deck chalked, and we shall be able to dance quadrilles all
      day; and then, whoever we know that's musical, you know, why they'll make
      themselves useful and agreeable; and-and-upon the whole, I really hope we
      shall have a glorious day, you know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement of these arrangements was received with the utmost
      enthusiasm. Mrs. Taunton, Emily, and Sophia, were loud in their praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, but tell me, Percy,' said Mrs. Taunton, 'who are the ten gentlemen
      to be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! I know plenty of fellows who'll be delighted with the scheme,'
      replied Mr. Percy Noakes; 'of course we shall have-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Hardy!' interrupted the servant, announcing a visitor. Miss Sophia
      and Miss Emily hastily assumed the most interesting attitudes that could
      be adopted on so short a notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you?' said a stout gentleman of about forty, pausing at the door
      in the attitude of an awkward harlequin. This was Mr. Hardy, whom we have
      before described, on the authority of Mrs. Stubbs, as 'the funny
      gentleman.' He was an Astley-Cooperish Joe Miller-a practical joker,
      immensely popular with married ladies, and a general favourite with young
      men. He was always engaged in some pleasure excursion or other, and
      delighted in getting somebody into a scrape on such occasions. He could
      sing comic songs, imitate hackney-coachmen and fowls, play airs on his
      chin, and execute concertos on the Jews'-harp. He always eat and drank
      most immoderately, and was the bosom friend of Mr. Percy Noakes. He had a
      red face, a somewhat husky voice, and a tremendous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you?' said this worthy, laughing, as if it were the finest joke
      in the world to make a morning call, and shaking hands with the ladies
      with as much vehemence as if their arms had been so many pump-handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're just the very man I wanted,' said Mr. Percy Noakes, who proceeded
      to explain the cause of his being in requisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha! ha! ha!' shouted Hardy, after hearing the statement, and receiving a
      detailed account of the proposed excursion. 'Oh, capital! glorious! What a
      day it will be! what fun!-But, I say, when are you going to begin making
      the arrangements?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No time like the present-at once, if you please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, charming!' cried the ladies. 'Pray, do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing materials were laid before Mr. Percy Noakes, and the names of the
      different members of the committee were agreed on, after as much
      discussion between him and Mr. Hardy as if the fate of nations had
      depended on their appointment. It was then agreed that a meeting should
      take place at Mr. Percy Noakes's chambers on the ensuing Wednesday evening
      at eight o'clock, and the visitors departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday evening arrived; eight o'clock came, and eight members of the
      committee were punctual in their attendance. Mr. Loggins, the solicitor,
      of Boswell-court, sent an excuse, and Mr. Samuel Briggs, the ditto of
      Furnival's Inn, sent his brother: much to his (the brother's)
      satisfaction, and greatly to the discomfiture of Mr. Percy Noakes. Between
      the Briggses and the Tauntons there existed a degree of implacable hatred,
      quite unprecedented. The animosity between the Montagues and Capulets, was
      nothing to that which prevailed between these two illustrious houses. Mrs.
      Briggs was a widow, with three daughters and two sons; Mr. Samuel, the
      eldest, was an attorney, and Mr. Alexander, the youngest, was under
      articles to his brother. They resided in Portland-street, Oxford-street,
      and moved in the same orbit as the Tauntons-hence their mutual dislike. If
      the Miss Briggses appeared in smart bonnets, the Miss Tauntons eclipsed
      them with smarter. If Mrs. Taunton appeared in a cap of all the hues of
      the rainbow, Mrs. Briggs forthwith mounted a toque, with all the patterns
      of the kaleidoscope. If Miss Sophia Taunton learnt a new song, two of the
      Miss Briggses came out with a new duet. The Tauntons had once gained a
      temporary triumph with the assistance of a harp, but the Briggses brought
      three guitars into the field, and effectually routed the enemy. There was
      no end to the rivalry between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as Mr. Samuel Briggs was a mere machine, a sort of self-acting legal
      walking-stick; and as the party was known to have originated, however
      remotely, with Mrs. Taunton, the female branches of the Briggs family had
      arranged that Mr. Alexander should attend, instead of his brother; and as
      the said Mr. Alexander was deservedly celebrated for possessing all the
      pertinacity of a bankruptcy-court attorney, combined with the obstinacy of
      that useful animal which browses on the thistle, he required but little
      tuition. He was especially enjoined to make himself as disagreeable as
      possible; and, above all, to black-ball the Tauntons at every hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings of the evening were opened by Mr. Percy Noakes. After
      successfully urging on the gentlemen present the propriety of their mixing
      some brandy-and-water, he briefly stated the object of the meeting, and
      concluded by observing that the first step must be the selection of a
      chairman, necessarily possessing some arbitrary-he trusted not
      unconstitutional-powers, to whom the personal direction of the whole of
      the arrangements (subject to the approval of the committee) should be
      confided. A pale young gentleman, in a green stock and spectacles of the
      same, a member of the honourable society of the Inner Temple, immediately
      rose for the purpose of proposing Mr. Percy Noakes. He had known him long,
      and this he would say, that a more honourable, a more excellent, or a
      better-hearted fellow, never existed.-(Hear, hear!) The young gentleman,
      who was a member of a debating society, took this opportunity of entering
      into an examination of the state of the English law, from the days of
      William the Conqueror down to the present period; he briefly adverted to
      the code established by the ancient Druids; slightly glanced at the
      principles laid down by the Athenian law-givers; and concluded with a most
      glowing eulogium on pic-nics and constitutional rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alexander Briggs opposed the motion. He had the highest esteem for Mr.
      Percy Noakes as an individual, but he did consider that he ought not to be
      intrusted with these immense powers-(oh, oh!)-He believed that in the
      proposed capacity Mr. Percy Noakes would not act fairly, impartially, or
      honourably; but he begged it to be distinctly understood, that he said
      this, without the slightest personal disrespect. Mr. Hardy defended his
      honourable friend, in a voice rendered partially unintelligible by emotion
      and brandy-and-water. The proposition was put to the vote, and there
      appearing to be only one dissentient voice, Mr. Percy Noakes was declared
      duly elected, and took the chair accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of the meeting now proceeded with rapidity. The chairman
      delivered in his estimate of the probable expense of the excursion, and
      every one present subscribed his portion thereof. The question was put
      that 'The Endeavour' be hired for the occasion; Mr. Alexander Briggs moved
      as an amendment, that the word 'Fly' be substituted for the word
      'Endeavour'; but after some debate consented to withdraw his opposition.
      The important ceremony of balloting then commenced. A tea-caddy was placed
      on a table in a dark corner of the apartment, and every one was provided
      with two backgammon men, one black and one white.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairman with great solemnity then read the following list of the
      guests whom he proposed to introduce:-Mrs. Taunton and two daughters, Mr.
      Wizzle, Mr. Simson. The names were respectively balloted for, and Mrs.
      Taunton and her daughters were declared to be black-balled. Mr. Percy
      Noakes and Mr. Hardy exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is your list prepared, Mr. Briggs?' inquired the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is,' replied Alexander, delivering in the following:-'Mrs. Briggs and
      three daughters, Mr. Samuel Briggs.' The previous ceremony was repeated,
      and Mrs. Briggs and three daughters were declared to be black- balled. Mr.
      Alexander Briggs looked rather foolish, and the remainder of the company
      appeared somewhat overawed by the mysterious nature of the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balloting proceeded; but, one little circumstance which Mr. Percy
      Noakes had not originally foreseen, prevented the system from working
      quite as well as he had anticipated. Everybody was black-balled. Mr.
      Alexander Briggs, by way of retaliation, exercised his power of exclusion
      in every instance, and the result was, that after three hours had been
      consumed in hard balloting, the names of only three gentlemen were found
      to have been agreed to. In this dilemma what was to be done? either the
      whole plan must fall to the ground, or a compromise must be effected. The
      latter alternative was preferable; and Mr. Percy Noakes therefore proposed
      that the form of balloting should be dispensed with, and that every
      gentleman should merely be required to state whom he intended to bring.
      The proposal was acceded to; the Tauntons and the Briggses were
      reinstated; and the party was formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next Wednesday was fixed for the eventful day, and it was unanimously
      resolved that every member of the committee should wear a piece of blue
      sarsenet ribbon round his left arm. It appeared from the statement of Mr.
      Percy Noakes, that the boat belonged to the General Steam Navigation
      Company, and was then lying off the Custom-house; and, as he proposed that
      the dinner and wines should be provided by an eminent city purveyor, it
      was arranged that Mr. Percy Noakes should be on board by seven o'clock to
      superintend the arrangements, and that the remaining members of the
      committee, together with the company generally, should be expected to join
      her by nine o'clock. More brandy-and-water was despatched; several
      speeches were made by the different law students present; thanks were
      voted to the chairman; and the meeting separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather had been beautiful up to this period, and beautiful it
      continued to be. Sunday passed over, and Mr. Percy Noakes became unusually
      fidgety-rushing, constantly, to and from the Steam Packet Wharf, to the
      astonishment of the clerks, and the great emolument of the Holborn cabmen.
      Tuesday arrived, and the anxiety of Mr. Percy Noakes knew no bounds. He
      was every instant running to the window, to look out for clouds; and Mr.
      Hardy astonished the whole square by practising a new comic song for the
      occasion, in the chairman's chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uneasy were the slumbers of Mr. Percy Noakes that night; he tossed and
      tumbled about, and had confused dreams of steamers starting off, and
      gigantic clocks with the hands pointing to a quarter-past nine, and the
      ugly face of Mr. Alexander Briggs looking over the boat's side, and
      grinning, as if in derision of his fruitless attempts to move. He made a
      violent effort to get on board, and awoke. The bright sun was shining
      cheerfully into the bedroom, and Mr. Percy Noakes started up for his
      watch, in the dreadful expectation of finding his worst dreams realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just five o'clock. He calculated the time-he should be a good
      half-hour dressing himself; and as it was a lovely morning, and the tide
      would be then running down, he would walk leisurely to Strand-lane, and
      have a boat to the Custom-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed himself, took a hasty apology for a breakfast, and sallied
      forth. The streets looked as lonely and deserted as if they had been
      crowded, overnight, for the last time. Here and there, an early
      apprentice, with quenched-looking sleepy eyes, was taking down the
      shutters of a shop; and a policeman or milkwoman might occasionally be
      seen pacing slowly along; but the servants had not yet begun to clean the
      doors, or light the kitchen fires, and London looked the picture of
      desolation. At the corner of a by-street, near Temple-bar, was stationed a
      'street-breakfast.' The coffee was boiling over a charcoal fire, and large
      slices of bread and butter were piled one upon the other, like deals in a
      timber-yard. The company were seated on a form, which, with a view both to
      security and comfort, was placed against a neighbouring wall. Two young
      men, whose uproarious mirth and disordered dress bespoke the conviviality
      of the preceding evening, were treating three 'ladies' and an Irish
      labourer. A little sweep was standing at a short distance, casting a
      longing eye at the tempting delicacies; and a policeman was watching the
      group from the opposite side of the street. The wan looks and gaudy finery
      of the thinly-clad women contrasted as strangely with the gay sunlight, as
      did their forced merriment with the boisterous hilarity of the two young
      men, who, now and then, varied their amusements by 'bonneting' the
      proprietor of this itinerant coffee- house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Noakes walked briskly by, and when he turned down Strand-lane,
      and caught a glimpse of the glistening water, he thought he had never felt
      so important or so happy in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Boat, sir?' cried one of the three watermen who were mopping out their
      boats, and all whistling. 'Boat, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' replied Mr. Percy Noakes, rather sharply; for the inquiry was not
      made in a manner at all suitable to his dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would you prefer a wessel, sir?' inquired another, to the infinite
      delight of the 'Jack-in-the-water.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Noakes replied with a look of supreme contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you want to be put on board a steamer, sir?' inquired an old
      fireman-waterman, very confidentially. He was dressed in a faded red suit,
      just the colour of the cover of a very old Court-guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, make haste-the Endeavour-off the Custom-house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Endeavour!' cried the man who had convulsed the 'Jack' before. 'Vy, I see
      the Endeavour go up half an hour ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So did I,' said another; 'and I should think she'd gone down by this
      time, for she's a precious sight too full of ladies and gen'lemen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Noakes affected to disregard these representations, and stepped
      into the boat, which the old man, by dint of scrambling, and shoving, and
      grating, had brought up to the causeway. 'Shove her off!' cried Mr. Percy
      Noakes, and away the boat glided down the river; Mr. Percy Noakes seated
      on the recently mopped seat, and the watermen at the stairs offering to
      bet him any reasonable sum that he'd never reach the 'Custum-us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here she is, by Jove!' said the delighted Percy, as they ran alongside
      the Endeavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hold hard!' cried the steward over the side, and Mr. Percy Noakes jumped
      on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hope you will find everything as you wished, sir. She looks uncommon well
      this morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She does, indeed,' replied the manager, in a state of ecstasy which it is
      impossible to describe. The deck was scrubbed, and the seats were
      scrubbed, and there was a bench for the band, and a place for dancing, and
      a pile of camp-stools, and an awning; and then Mr. Percy Noakes bustled
      down below, and there were the pastrycook's men, and the steward's wife,
      laying out the dinner on two tables the whole length of the cabin; and
      then Mr. Percy Noakes took off his coat and rushed backwards and forwards,
      doing nothing, but quite convinced he was assisting everybody; and the
      steward's wife laughed till she cried, and Mr. Percy Noakes panted with
      the violence of his exertions. And then the bell at London-bridge wharf
      rang; and a Margate boat was just starting; and a Gravesend boat was just
      starting, and people shouted, and porters ran down the steps with luggage
      that would crush any men but porters; and sloping boards, with bits of
      wood nailed on them, were placed between the outside boat and the inside
      boat; and the passengers ran along them, and looked like so many fowls
      coming out of an area; and then, the bell ceased, and the boards were
      taken away, and the boats started, and the whole scene was one of the most
      delightful bustle and confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time wore on; half-past eight o'clock arrived; the pastry-cook's men
      went ashore; the dinner was completely laid out; and Mr. Percy Noakes
      locked the principal cabin, and put the key in his pocket, in order that
      it might be suddenly disclosed, in all its magnificence, to the eyes of
      the astonished company. The band came on board, and so did the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes to nine, and the committee embarked in a body. There was Mr.
      Hardy, in a blue jacket and waistcoat, white trousers, silk stockings, and
      pumps-in full aquatic costume, with a straw hat on his head, and an
      immense telescope under his arm; and there was the young gentleman with
      the green spectacles, in nankeen inexplicables, with a ditto waistcoat and
      bright buttons, like the pictures of Paul-not the saint, but he of
      Virginia notoriety. The remainder of the committee, dressed in white hats,
      light jackets, waistcoats, and trousers, looked something between waiters
      and West India planters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine o'clock struck, and the company arrived in shoals. Mr. Samuel Briggs,
      Mrs. Briggs, and the Misses Briggs, made their appearance in a smart
      private wherry. The three guitars, in their respective dark green cases,
      were carefully stowed away in the bottom of the boat, accompanied by two
      immense portfolios of music, which it would take at least a week's
      incessant playing to get through. The Tauntons arrived at the same moment
      with more music, and a lion-a gentleman with a bass voice and an incipient
      red moustache. The colours of the Taunton party were pink; those of the
      Briggses a light blue. The Tauntons had artificial flowers in their
      bonnets; here the Briggses gained a decided advantage-they wore feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How d'ye do, dear?' said the Misses Briggs to the Misses Taunton. (The
      word 'dear' among girls is frequently synonymous with 'wretch.')
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite well, thank you, dear,' replied the Misses Taunton to the Misses
      Briggs; and then, there was such a kissing, and congratulating, and
      shaking of hands, as might have induced one to suppose that the two
      families were the best friends in the world, instead of each wishing the
      other overboard, as they most sincerely did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Noakes received the visitors, and bowed to the strange
      gentleman, as if he should like to know who he was. This was just what
      Mrs. Taunton wanted. Here was an opportunity to astonish the Briggses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! I beg your pardon,' said the general of the Taunton party, with a
      careless air.-'Captain Helves-Mr. Percy Noakes-Mrs. Briggs-Captain
      Helves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Noakes bowed very low; the gallant captain did the same with all
      due ferocity, and the Briggses were clearly overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our friend, Mr. Wizzle, being unfortunately prevented from coming,'
      resumed Mrs. Taunton, 'I did myself the pleasure of bringing the captain,
      whose musical talents I knew would be a great acquisition.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the name of the committee I have to thank you for doing so, and to
      offer you welcome, sir,' replied Percy. (Here the scraping was renewed.)
      'But pray be seated-won't you walk aft? Captain, will you conduct Miss
      Taunton?-Miss Briggs, will you allow me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where could they have picked up that military man?' inquired Mrs. Briggs
      of Miss Kate Briggs, as they followed the little party.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't imagine,' replied Miss Kate, bursting with vexation; for the very
      fierce air with which the gallant captain regarded the company, had
      impressed her with a high sense of his importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boat after boat came alongside, and guest after guest arrived. The invites
      had been excellently arranged: Mr. Percy Noakes having considered it as
      important that the number of young men should exactly tally with that of
      the young ladies, as that the quantity of knives on board should be in
      precise proportion to the forks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, is every one on board?' inquired Mr. Percy Noakes. The committee
      (who, with their bits of blue ribbon, looked as if they were all going to
      be bled) bustled about to ascertain the fact, and reported that they might
      safely start.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go on!' cried the master of the boat from the top of one of the paddle-
      boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go on!' echoed the boy, who was stationed over the hatchway to pass the
      directions down to the engineer; and away went the vessel with that
      agreeable noise which is peculiar to steamers, and which is composed of a
      mixture of creaking, gushing, clanging, and snorting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hoi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-o-i-i-i!' shouted half-a-dozen voices from a boat, a
      quarter of a mile astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ease her!' cried the captain: 'do these people belong to us, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Noakes,' exclaimed Hardy, who had been looking at every object far and
      near, through the large telescope, 'it's the Fleetwoods and the
      Wakefields-and two children with them, by Jove!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a shame to bring children!' said everybody; 'how very
      inconsiderate!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say, it would be a good joke to pretend not to see 'em, wouldn't it?'
      suggested Hardy, to the immense delight of the company generally. A
      council of war was hastily held, and it was resolved that the newcomers
      should be taken on board, on Mr. Hardy solemnly pledging himself to tease
      the children during the whole of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop her!' cried the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop her!' repeated the boy; whizz went the steam, and all the young
      ladies, as in duty bound, screamed in concert. They were only appeased by
      the assurance of the martial Helves, that the escape of steam consequent
      on stopping a vessel was seldom attended with any great loss of human
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men ran to the side; and after some shouting, and swearing, and
      angling for the wherry with a boat-hook, Mr. Fleetwood, and Mrs.
      Fleetwood, and Master Fleetwood, and Mr. Wakefield, and Mrs. Wakefield,
      and Miss Wakefield, were safely deposited on the deck. The girl was about
      six years old, the boy about four; the former was dressed in a white frock
      with a pink sash and dog's-eared-looking little spencer: a straw bonnet
      and green veil, six inches by three and a half; the latter, was attired
      for the occasion in a nankeen frock, between the bottom of which, and the
      top of his plaid socks, a considerable portion of two small mottled legs
      was discernible. He had a light blue cap with a gold band and tassel on
      his head, and a damp piece of gingerbread in his hand, with which he had
      slightly embossed his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat once more started off; the band played 'Off she goes:' the major
      part of the company conversed cheerfully in groups; and the old gentlemen
      walked up and down the deck in pairs, as perseveringly and gravely as if
      they were doing a match against time for an immense stake. They ran
      briskly down the Pool; the gentlemen pointed out the Docks, the Thames
      Police-office, and other elegant public edifices; and the young ladies
      exhibited a proper display of horror at the appearance of the
      coal-whippers and ballast-heavers. Mr. Hardy told stories to the married
      ladies, at which they laughed very much in their pocket- handkerchiefs,
      and hit him on the knuckles with their fans, declaring him to be 'a
      naughty man-a shocking creature'-and so forth; and Captain Helves gave
      slight descriptions of battles and duels, with a most bloodthirsty air,
      which made him the admiration of the women, and the envy of the men.
      Quadrilling commenced; Captain Helves danced one set with Miss Emily
      Taunton, and another set with Miss Sophia Taunton. Mrs. Taunton was in
      ecstasies. The victory appeared to be complete; but alas! the inconstancy
      of man! Having performed this necessary duty, he attached himself solely
      to Miss Julia Briggs, with whom he danced no less than three sets
      consecutively, and from whose side he evinced no intention of stirring for
      the remainder of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardy, having played one or two very brilliant fantasias on the
      Jews'-harp, and having frequently repeated the exquisitely amusing joke of
      slily chalking a large cross on the back of some member of the committee,
      Mr. Percy Noakes expressed his hope that some of their musical friends
      would oblige the company by a display of their abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps,' he said in a very insinuating manner, 'Captain Helves will
      oblige us?' Mrs. Taunton's countenance lighted up, for the captain only
      sang duets, and couldn't sing them with anybody but one of her daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really,' said that warlike individual, 'I should be very happy, 'but-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! pray do,' cried all the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Emily, have you any objection to join in a duet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! not the slightest,' returned the young lady, in a tone which clearly
      showed she had the greatest possible objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I accompany you, dear?' inquired one of the Miss Briggses, with the
      bland intention of spoiling the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very much obliged to you, Miss Briggs,' sharply retorted Mrs. Taunton,
      who saw through the manoeuvre; 'my daughters always sing without
      accompaniments.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And without voices,' tittered Mrs. Briggs, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps,' said Mrs. Taunton, reddening, for she guessed the tenor of the
      observation, though she had not heard it clearly-'Perhaps it would be as
      well for some people, if their voices were not quite so audible as they
      are to other people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And, perhaps, if gentlemen who are kidnapped to pay attention to some
      persons' daughters, had not sufficient discernment to pay attention to
      other persons' daughters,' returned Mrs. Briggs, 'some persons would not
      be so ready to display that ill-temper which, thank God, distinguishes
      them from other persons.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Persons!' ejaculated Mrs. Taunton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Persons,' replied Mrs. Briggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Insolence!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Creature!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush! hush!' interrupted Mr. Percy Noakes, who was one of the very few by
      whom this dialogue had been overheard. 'Hush!-pray, silence for the duet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a great deal of preparatory crowing and humming, the captain began
      the following duet from the opera of 'Paul and Virginia,' in that grunting
      tone in which a man gets down, Heaven knows where, without the remotest
      chance of ever getting up again. This, in private circles, is frequently
      designated 'a bass voice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'See (sung the captain) from o-ce-an ri-sing Bright flames the or-b of
      d-ay. From yon gro-ove, the varied so-ongs-'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, the singer was interrupted by varied cries of the most dreadful
      description, proceeding from some grove in the immediate vicinity of the
      starboard paddle-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My child!' screamed Mrs. Fleetwood. 'My child! it is his voice-I know
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fleetwood, accompanied by several gentlemen, here rushed to the
      quarter from whence the noise proceeded, and an exclamation of horror
      burst from the company; the general impression being, that the little
      innocent had either got his head in the water, or his legs in the
      machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is the matter?' shouted the agonised father, as he returned with the
      child in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! oh! oh!' screamed the small sufferer again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is the matter, dear?' inquired the father once more-hastily
      stripping off the nankeen frock, for the purpose of ascertaining whether
      the child had one bone which was not smashed to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! oh!-I'm so frightened!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What at, dear?-what at?' said the mother, soothing the sweet infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! he's been making such dreadful faces at me,' cried the boy, relapsing
      into convulsions at the bare recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He!-who?' cried everybody, crowding round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!-him!' replied the child, pointing at Hardy, who affected to be the
      most concerned of the whole group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real state of the case at once flashed upon the minds of all present,
      with the exception of the Fleetwoods and the Wakefields. The facetious
      Hardy, in fulfilment of his promise, had watched the child to a remote
      part of the vessel, and, suddenly appearing before him with the most awful
      contortions of visage, had produced his paroxysm of terror. Of course, he
      now observed that it was hardly necessary for him to deny the accusation;
      and the unfortunate little victim was accordingly led below, after
      receiving sundry thumps on the head from both his parents, for having the
      wickedness to tell a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little interruption having been adjusted, the captain resumed, and
      Miss Emily chimed in, in due course. The duet was loudly applauded, and,
      certainly, the perfect independence of the parties deserved great
      commendation. Miss Emily sung her part, without the slightest reference to
      the captain; and the captain sang so loud, that he had not the slightest
      idea what was being done by his partner. After having gone through the
      last few eighteen or nineteen bars by himself, therefore, he acknowledged
      the plaudits of the circle with that air of self-denial which men usually
      assume when they think they have done something to astonish the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' said Mr. Percy Noakes, who had just ascended from the fore-cabin,
      where he had been busily engaged in decanting the wine, 'if the Misses
      Briggs will oblige us with something before dinner, I am sure we shall be
      very much delighted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those hums of admiration followed the suggestion, which one
      frequently hears in society, when nobody has the most distant notion what
      he is expressing his approval of. The three Misses Briggs looked modestly
      at their mamma, and the mamma looked approvingly at her daughters, and
      Mrs. Taunton looked scornfully at all of them. The Misses Briggs asked for
      their guitars, and several gentlemen seriously damaged the cases in their
      anxiety to present them. Then, there was a very interesting production of
      three little keys for the aforesaid cases, and a melodramatic expression
      of horror at finding a string broken; and a vast deal of screwing and
      tightening, and winding, and tuning, during which Mrs. Briggs expatiated
      to those near her on the immense difficulty of playing a guitar, and
      hinted at the wondrous proficiency of her daughters in that mystic art.
      Mrs. Taunton whispered to a neighbour that it was 'quite sickening!' and
      the Misses Taunton looked as if they knew how to play, but disdained to do
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, the Misses Briggs began in real earnest. It was a new Spanish
      composition, for three voices and three guitars. The effect was
      electrical. All eyes were turned upon the captain, who was reported to
      have once passed through Spain with his regiment, and who must be well
      acquainted with the national music. He was in raptures. This was
      sufficient; the trio was encored; the applause was universal; and never
      had the Tauntons suffered such a complete defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bravo! bravo!' ejaculated the captain;-'bravo!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pretty! isn't it, sir?' inquired Mr. Samuel Briggs, with the air of a
      self-satisfied showman. By-the-bye, these were the first words he had been
      heard to utter since he left Boswell-court the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'De-lightful!' returned the captain, with a flourish, and a military
      cough;-'de-lightful!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sweet instrument!' said an old gentleman with a bald head, who had been
      trying all the morning to look through a telescope, inside the glass of
      which Mr. Hardy had fixed a large black wafer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you ever hear a Portuguese tambourine?' inquired that jocular
      individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you ever hear a tom-tom, sir?' sternly inquired the captain, who lost
      no opportunity of showing off his travels, real or pretended.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A what?' asked Hardy, rather taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A tom-tom.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor a gum-gum?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is a gum-gum?' eagerly inquired several young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When I was in the East Indies,' replied the captain-(here was a
      discovery-he had been in the East Indies!)-'when I was in the East Indies,
      I was once stopping a few thousand miles up the country, on a visit at the
      house of a very particular friend of mine, Ram Chowdar Doss Azuph Al
      Bowlar-a devilish pleasant fellow. As we were enjoying our hookahs, one
      evening, in the cool verandah in front of his villa, we were rather
      surprised by the sudden appearance of thirty-four of his Kit-ma-gars (for
      he had rather a large establishment there), accompanied by an equal number
      of Con-su-mars, approaching the house with a threatening aspect, and
      beating a tom-tom. The Ram started up-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?' inquired the bald gentleman, intensely interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Ram-Ram Chowdar-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' said the old gentleman, 'beg your pardon; pray go on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '-Started up and drew a pistol. "Helves," said he, "my boy,"-he always
      called me, my boy-"Helves," said he, "do you hear that tom-tom?" "I do,"
      said I. His countenance, which before was pale, assumed a most frightful
      appearance; his whole visage was distorted, and his frame shaken by
      violent emotions. "Do you see that gum-gum?" said he. "No," said I,
      staring about me. "You don't?" said he. "No, I'll be damned if I do," said
      I; "and what's more, I don't know what a gum-gum is," said I. I really
      thought the Ram would have dropped. He drew me aside, and with an
      expression of agony I shall never forget, said in a low whisper-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dinner's on the table, ladies,' interrupted the steward's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you allow me?' said the captain, immediately suiting the action to
      the word, and escorting Miss Julia Briggs to the cabin, with as much ease
      as if he had finished the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What an extraordinary circumstance!' ejaculated the same old gentleman,
      preserving his listening attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a traveller!' said the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a singular name!' exclaimed the gentlemen, rather confused by the
      coolness of the whole affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish he had finished the story,' said an old lady. 'I wonder what a
      gum-gum really is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By Jove!' exclaimed Hardy, who until now had been lost in utter
      amazement, 'I don't know what it may be in India, but in England I think a
      gum-gum has very much the same meaning as a hum-bug.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How illiberal! how envious!' cried everybody, as they made for the cabin,
      fully impressed with a belief in the captain's amazing adventures. Helves
      was the sole lion for the remainder of the day-impudence and the
      marvellous are pretty sure passports to any society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party had by this time reached their destination, and put about on
      their return home. The wind, which had been with them the whole day, was
      now directly in their teeth; the weather had become gradually more and
      more overcast; and the sky, water, and shore, were all of that dull,
      heavy, uniform lead-colour, which house-painters daub in the first
      instance over a street-door which is gradually approaching a state of
      convalescence. It had been 'spitting' with rain for the last half-hour,
      and now began to pour in good earnest. The wind was freshening very fast,
      and the waterman at the wheel had unequivocally expressed his opinion that
      there would shortly be a squall. A slight emotion on the part of the
      vessel, now and then, seemed to suggest the possibility of its pitching to
      a very uncomfortable extent in the event of its blowing harder; and every
      timber began to creak, as if the boat were an overladen clothes-basket.
      Sea-sickness, however, is like a belief in ghosts-every one entertains
      some misgivings on the subject, but few will acknowledge any. The majority
      of the company, therefore, endeavoured to look peculiarly happy, feeling
      all the while especially miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't it rain?' inquired the old gentleman before noticed, when, by dint
      of squeezing and jamming, they were all seated at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it does-a little,' replied Mr. Percy Noakes, who could hardly
      hear himself speak, in consequence of the pattering on the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't it blow?' inquired some one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I don't think it does,' responded Hardy, sincerely wishing that he
      could persuade himself that it did not; for he sat near the door, and was
      almost blown off his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It'll soon clear up,' said Mr. Percy Noakes, in a cheerful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, certainly!' ejaculated the committee generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt of it!' said the remainder of the company, whose attention was
      now pretty well engrossed by the serious business of eating, carving,
      taking wine, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throbbing motion of the engine was but too perceptible. There was a
      large, substantial, cold boiled leg of mutton, at the bottom of the table,
      shaking like blancmange; a previously hearty sirloin of beef looked as if
      it had been suddenly seized with the palsy; and some tongues, which were
      placed on dishes rather too large for them, went through the most
      surprising evolutions; darting from side to side, and from end to end,
      like a fly in an inverted wine-glass. Then, the sweets shook and trembled,
      till it was quite impossible to help them, and people gave up the attempt
      in despair; and the pigeon-pies looked as if the birds, whose legs were
      stuck outside, were trying to get them in. The table vibrated and started
      like a feverish pulse, and the very legs were convulsed-everything was
      shaking and jarring. The beams in the roof of the cabin seemed as if they
      were put there for the sole purpose of giving people head-aches, and
      several elderly gentlemen became ill- tempered in consequence. As fast as
      the steward put the fire-irons up, they would fall down again; and the
      more the ladies and gentlemen tried to sit comfortably on their seats, the
      more the seats seemed to slide away from the ladies and gentlemen. Several
      ominous demands were made for small glasses of brandy; the countenances of
      the company gradually underwent most extraordinary changes; one gentleman
      was observed suddenly to rush from table without the slightest ostensible
      reason, and dart up the steps with incredible swiftness: thereby greatly
      damaging both himself and the steward, who happened to be coming down at
      the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloth was removed; the dessert was laid on the table; and the glasses
      were filled. The motion of the boat increased; several members of the
      party began to feel rather vague and misty, and looked as if they had only
      just got up. The young gentleman with the spectacles, who had been in a
      fluctuating state for some time-at one moment bright, and at another
      dismal, like a revolving light on the sea-coast-rashly announced his wish
      to propose a toast. After several ineffectual attempts to preserve his
      perpendicular, the young gentleman, having managed to hook himself to the
      centre leg of the table with his left hand, proceeded as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ladies and gentlemen. A gentleman is among us-I may say a stranger-(here
      some painful thought seemed to strike the orator; he paused, and looked
      extremely odd)-whose talents, whose travels, whose cheerfulness-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, Edkins,' hastily interrupted Mr. Percy Noakes,-'Hardy,
      what's the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing,' replied the 'funny gentleman,' who had just life enough left to
      utter two consecutive syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you have some brandy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' replied Hardy in a tone of great indignation, and looking as
      comfortable as Temple-bar in a Scotch mist; 'what should I want brandy
      for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you go on deck?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I will not.' This was said with a most determined air, and in a voice
      which might have been taken for an imitation of anything; it was quite as
      much like a guinea-pig as a bassoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, Edkins,' said the courteous Percy; 'I thought our
      friend was ill. Pray go on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray go on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Edkins is gone,' cried somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, sir,' said the steward, running up to Mr. Percy
      Noakes, 'I beg your pardon, sir, but the gentleman as just went on
      deck-him with the green spectacles-is uncommon bad, to be sure; and the
      young man as played the wiolin says, that unless he has some brandy he
      can't answer for the consequences. He says he has a wife and two children,
      whose werry subsistence depends on his breaking a wessel, and he expects
      to do so every moment. The flageolet's been werry ill, but he's better,
      only he's in a dreadful prusperation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      All disguise was now useless; the company staggered on deck; the gentlemen
      tried to see nothing but the clouds; and the ladies, muffled up in such
      shawls and cloaks as they had brought with them, lay about on the seats,
      and under the seats, in the most wretched condition. Never was such a
      blowing, and raining, and pitching, and tossing, endured by any pleasure
      party before. Several remonstrances were sent down below, on the subject
      of Master Fleetwood, but they were totally unheeded in consequence of the
      indisposition of his natural protectors. That interesting child screamed
      at the top of his voice, until he had no voice left to scream with; and
      then, Miss Wakefield began, and screamed for the remainder of the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardy was observed, some hours afterwards, in an attitude which
      induced his friends to suppose that he was busily engaged in contemplating
      the beauties of the deep; they only regretted that his taste for the
      picturesque should lead him to remain so long in a position, very
      injurious at all times, but especially so, to an individual labouring
      under a tendency of blood to the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party arrived off the Custom-house at about two o'clock on the
      Thursday morning dispirited and worn out. The Tauntons were too ill to
      quarrel with the Briggses, and the Briggses were too wretched to annoy the
      Tauntons. One of the guitar-cases was lost on its passage to a
      hackney-coach, and Mrs. Briggs has not scrupled to state that the Tauntons
      bribed a porter to throw it down an area. Mr. Alexander Briggs opposes
      vote by ballot-he says from personal experience of its inefficacy; and Mr.
      Samuel Briggs, whenever he is asked to express his sentiments on the
      point, says he has no opinion on that or any other subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Edkins-the young gentleman in the green spectacles-makes a speech on
      every occasion on which a speech can possibly be made: the eloquence of
      which can only be equalled by its length. In the event of his not being
      previously appointed to a judgeship, it is probable that he will practise
      as a barrister in the New Central Criminal Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Helves continued his attention to Miss Julia Briggs, whom he might
      possibly have espoused, if it had not unfortunately happened that Mr.
      Samuel arrested him, in the way of business, pursuant to instructions
      received from Messrs. Scroggins and Payne, whose town- debts the gallant
      captain had condescended to collect, but whose accounts, with the
      indiscretion sometimes peculiar to military minds, he had omitted to keep
      with that dull accuracy which custom has rendered necessary. Mrs. Taunton
      complains that she has been much deceived in him. He introduced himself to
      the family on board a Gravesend steam- packet, and certainly, therefore,
      ought to have proved respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy Noakes is as light-hearted and careless as ever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII-THE GREAT WINGLEBURY DUEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little town of Great Winglebury is exactly forty-two miles and
      three-quarters from Hyde Park corner. It has a long, straggling, quiet
      High-street, with a great black and white clock at a small red Town- hall,
      half-way up-a market-place-a cage-an assembly-room-a church-a bridge-a
      chapel-a theatre-a library-an inn-a pump-and a Post-office. Tradition
      tells of a 'Little Winglebury,' down some cross-road about two miles off;
      and, as a square mass of dirty paper, supposed to have been originally
      intended for a letter, with certain tremulous characters inscribed
      thereon, in which a lively imagination might trace a remote resemblance to
      the word 'Little,' was once stuck up to be owned in the sunny window of
      the Great Winglebury Post-office, from which it only disappeared when it
      fell to pieces with dust and extreme old age, there would appear to be
      some foundation for the legend. Common belief is inclined to bestow the
      name upon a little hole at the end of a muddy lane about a couple of miles
      long, colonised by one wheelwright, four paupers, and a beer-shop; but,
      even this authority, slight as it is, must be regarded with extreme
      suspicion, inasmuch as the inhabitants of the hole aforesaid, concur in
      opining that it never had any name at all, from the earliest ages down to
      the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Winglebury Arms, in the centre of the High-street, opposite the small
      building with the big clock, is the principal inn of Great Winglebury-the
      commercial-inn, posting-house, and excise-office; the 'Blue' house at
      every election, and the judges' house at every assizes. It is the
      head-quarters of the Gentlemen's Whist Club of Winglebury Blues (so called
      in opposition to the Gentlemen's Whist Club of Winglebury Buffs, held at
      the other house, a little further down): and whenever a juggler, or
      wax-work man, or concert-giver, takes Great Winglebury in his circuit, it
      is immediately placarded all over the town that Mr. So-and-so, 'trusting
      to that liberal support which the inhabitants of Great Winglebury have
      long been so liberal in bestowing, has at a great expense engaged the
      elegant and commodious assembly- rooms, attached to the Winglebury Arms.'
      The house is a large one, with a red brick and stone front; a pretty
      spacious hall, ornamented with evergreen plants, terminates in a
      perspective view of the bar, and a glass case, in which are displayed a
      choice variety of delicacies ready for dressing, to catch the eye of a
      new-comer the moment he enters, and excite his appetite to the highest
      possible pitch. Opposite doors lead to the 'coffee' and 'commercial'
      rooms; and a great wide, rambling staircase,-three stairs and a
      landing-four stairs and another landing-one step and another
      landing-half-a-dozen stairs and another landing-and so on-conducts to
      galleries of bedrooms, and labyrinths of sitting-rooms, denominated
      'private,' where you may enjoy yourself, as privately as you can in any
      place where some bewildered being walks into your room every five minutes,
      by mistake, and then walks out again, to open all the doors along the
      gallery until he finds his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the Winglebury Arms, at this day, and such was the Winglebury Arms
      some time since-no matter when-two or three minutes before the arrival of
      the London stage. Four horses with cloths on-change for a coach-were
      standing quietly at the corner of the yard surrounded by a listless group
      of post-boys in shiny hats and smock-frocks, engaged in discussing the
      merits of the cattle; half a dozen ragged boys were standing a little
      apart, listening with evident interest to the conversation of these
      worthies; and a few loungers were collected round the horse-trough,
      awaiting the arrival of the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was hot and sunny, the town in the zenith of its dulness, and with
      the exception of these few idlers, not a living creature was to be seen.
      Suddenly, the loud notes of a key-bugle broke the monotonous stillness of
      the street; in came the coach, rattling over the uneven paving with a
      noise startling enough to stop even the large-faced clock itself. Down got
      the outsides, up went the windows in all directions, out came the waiters,
      up started the ostlers, and the loungers, and the post-boys, and the
      ragged boys, as if they were electrified-unstrapping, and unchaining, and
      unbuckling, and dragging willing horses out, and forcing reluctant horses
      in, and making a most exhilarating bustle. 'Lady inside, here!' said the
      guard. 'Please to alight, ma'am,' said the waiter. 'Private sitting-room?'
      interrogated the lady. 'Certainly, ma'am,' responded the chamber-maid.
      'Nothing but these 'ere trunks, ma'am?' inquired the guard. 'Nothing
      more,' replied the lady. Up got the outsides again, and the guard, and the
      coachman; off came the cloths, with a jerk; 'All right,' was the cry; and
      away they went. The loungers lingered a minute or two in the road,
      watching the coach until it turned the corner, and then loitered away one
      by one. The street was clear again, and the town, by contrast, quieter
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lady in number twenty-five,' screamed the landlady.-'Thomas!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Letter just been left for the gentleman in number nineteen. Boots at the
      Lion left it. No answer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Letter for you, sir,' said Thomas, depositing the letter on number
      nineteen's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For me?' said number nineteen, turning from the window, out of which he
      had been surveying the scene just described.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir,'-(waiters always speak in hints, and never utter complete
      sentences,)-'yes, sir,-Boots at the Lion, sir,-Bar, sir,-Missis said
      number nineteen, sir-Alexander Trott, Esq., sir?-Your card at the bar,
      sir, I think, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My name is Trott,' replied number nineteen, breaking the seal. 'You may
      go, waiter.' The waiter pulled down the window-blind, and then pulled it
      up again-for a regular waiter must do something before he leaves the
      room-adjusted the glasses on the side-board, brushed a place that was not
      dusty, rubbed his hands very hard, walked stealthily to the door, and
      evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, evidently, something in the contents of the letter, of a
      nature, if not wholly unexpected, certainly extremely disagreeable. Mr.
      Alexander Trott laid it down, and took it up again, and walked about the
      room on particular squares of the carpet, and even attempted, though
      unsuccessfully, to whistle an air. It wouldn't do. He threw himself into a
      chair, and read the following epistle aloud:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Blue Lion and Stomach-warmer, 'Great Winglebury. 'Wednesday Morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir. Immediately on discovering your intentions, I left our counting-
      house, and followed you. I know the purport of your journey;-that journey
      shall never be completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have no friend here, just now, on whose secrecy I can rely. This shall
      be no obstacle to my revenge. Neither shall Emily Brown be exposed to the
      mercenary solicitations of a scoundrel, odious in her eyes, and
      contemptible in everybody else's: nor will I tamely submit to the
      clandestine attacks of a base umbrella-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir. From Great Winglebury church, a footpath leads through four meadows
      to a retired spot known to the townspeople as Stiffun's Acre.' [Mr. Trott
      shuddered.] 'I shall be waiting there alone, at twenty minutes before six
      o'clock to-morrow morning. Should I be disappointed in seeing you there, I
      will do myself the pleasure of calling with a horsewhip.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Horace Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'PS. There is a gunsmiths in the High-street; and they won't sell
      gunpowder after dark-you understand me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'PPS. You had better not order your breakfast in the morning until you
      have met me. It may be an unnecessary expense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Desperate-minded villain! I knew how it would be!' ejaculated the
      terrified Trott. 'I always told father, that once start me on this
      expedition, and Hunter would pursue me like the Wandering Jew. It's bad
      enough as it is, to marry with the old people's commands, and without the
      girl's consent; but what will Emily think of me, if I go down there
      breathless with running away from this infernal salamander? What shall I
      do? What can I do? If I go back to the city, I'm disgraced for ever-lose
      the girl-and, what's more, lose the money too. Even if I did go on to the
      Browns' by the coach, Hunter would be after me in a post- chaise; and if I
      go to this place, this Stiffun's Acre (another shudder), I'm as good as
      dead. I've seen him hit the man at the Pall- mall shooting-gallery, in the
      second button-hole of the waistcoat, five times out of every six, and when
      he didn't hit him there, he hit him in the head.' With this consolatory
      reminiscence Mr. Alexander Trott again ejaculated, 'What shall I do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Long and weary were his reflections, as, burying his face in his hand, he
      sat, ruminating on the best course to be pursued. His mental
      direction-post pointed to London. He thought of the 'governor's' anger,
      and the loss of the fortune which the paternal Brown had promised the
      paternal Trott his daughter should contribute to the coffers of his son.
      Then the words 'To Brown's' were legibly inscribed on the said
      direction-post, but Horace Hunter's denunciation rung in his ears;-last of
      all it bore, in red letters, the words, 'To Stiffun's Acre;' and then Mr.
      Alexander Trott decided on adopting a plan which he presently matured.
    </p>
    <p>
      First and foremost, he despatched the under-boots to the Blue Lion and
      Stomach-warmer, with a gentlemanly note to Mr. Horace Hunter, intimating
      that he thirsted for his destruction and would do himself the pleasure of
      slaughtering him next morning, without fail. He then wrote another letter,
      and requested the attendance of the other boots-for they kept a pair. A
      modest knock at the room door was heard. 'Come in,' said Mr. Trott. A man
      thrust in a red head with one eye in it, and being again desired to 'come
      in,' brought in the body and the legs to which the head belonged, and a
      fur cap which belonged to the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are the upper-boots, I think?' inquired Mr. Trott.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I am the upper-boots,' replied a voice from inside a velveteen case,
      with mother-of-pearl buttons-'that is, I'm the boots as b'longs to the
      house; the other man's my man, as goes errands and does odd jobs.
      Top-boots and half-boots, I calls us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're from London?' inquired Mr. Trott.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Driv a cab once,' was the laconic reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why don't you drive it now?' asked Mr. Trott.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Over-driv the cab, and driv over a 'ooman,' replied the top-boots, with
      brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know the mayor's house?' inquired Mr. Trott.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather,' replied the boots, significantly, as if he had some good reason
      to remember it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think you could manage to leave a letter there?' interrogated
      Trott.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shouldn't wonder,' responded boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But this letter,' said Trott, holding a deformed note with a paralytic
      direction in one hand, and five shillings in the other-'this letter is
      anonymous.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A-what?' interrupted the boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anonymous-he's not to know who it comes from.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! I see,' responded the reg'lar, with a knowing wink, but without
      evincing the slightest disinclination to undertake the charge-'I see-bit
      o' Sving, eh?' and his one eye wandered round the room, as if in quest of
      a dark lantern and phosphorus-box. 'But, I say!' he continued, recalling
      the eye from its search, and bringing it to bear on Mr. Trott. 'I say,
      he's a lawyer, our mayor, and insured in the County. If you've a spite
      agen him, you'd better not burn his house down-blessed if I don't think it
      would be the greatest favour you could do him.' And he chuckled inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Alexander Trott had been in any other situation, his first act
      would have been to kick the man down-stairs by deputy; or, in other words,
      to ring the bell, and desire the landlord to take his boots off. He
      contented himself, however, with doubling the fee and explaining that the
      letter merely related to a breach of the peace. The top-boots retired,
      solemnly pledged to secrecy; and Mr. Alexander Trott sat down to a fried
      sole, maintenon cutlet, Madeira, and sundries, with greater composure than
      he had experienced since the receipt of Horace Hunter's letter of
      defiance.

      The lady who alighted from the London coach had no sooner been installed
      in number twenty-five, and made some alteration in her travelling-dress,
      than she indited a note to Joseph Overton, esquire, solicitor, and mayor
      of Great Winglebury, requesting his immediate attendance on private
      business of paramount importance-a summons which that worthy functionary
      lost no time in obeying; for after sundry openings of his eyes, divers
      ejaculations of 'Bless me!' and other manifestations of surprise, he took
      his broad-brimmed hat from its accustomed peg in his little front office,
      and walked briskly down the High-street to the Winglebury Arms; through
      the hall and up the staircase of which establishment he was ushered by the
      landlady, and a crowd of officious waiters, to the door of number
      twenty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Show the gentleman in,' said the stranger lady, in reply to the foremost
      waiter's announcement. The gentleman was shown in accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady rose from the sofa; the mayor advanced a step from the door; and
      there they both paused, for a minute or two, looking at one another as if
      by mutual consent. The mayor saw before him a buxom, richly- dressed
      female of about forty; the lady looked upon a sleek man, about ten years
      older, in drab shorts and continuations, black coat, neckcloth, and
      gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Julia Manners!' exclaimed the mayor at length, 'you astonish me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's very unfair of you, Overton,' replied Miss Julia, 'for I have
      known you, long enough, not to be surprised at anything you do, and you
      might extend equal courtesy to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But to run away-actually run away-with a young man!' remonstrated the
      mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You wouldn't have me actually run away with an old one, I presume?' was
      the cool rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then to ask me-me-of all people in the world-a man of my age and
      appearance-mayor of the town-to promote such a scheme!' pettishly
      ejaculated Joseph Overton; throwing himself into an arm-chair, and
      producing Miss Julia's letter from his pocket, as if to corroborate the
      assertion that he had been asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, Overton,' replied the lady, 'I want your assistance in this matter,
      and I must have it. In the lifetime of that poor old dear, Mr. Cornberry,
      who-who-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who was to have married you, and didn't, because he died first; and who
      left you his property unencumbered with the addition of himself,'
      suggested the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' replied Miss Julia, reddening slightly, 'in the lifetime of the
      poor old dear, the property had the incumbrance of your management; and
      all I will say of that, is, that I only wonder it didn't die of
      consumption instead of its master. You helped yourself then:-help me now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Joseph Overton was a man of the world, and an attorney; and as certain
      indistinct recollections of an odd thousand pounds or two, appropriated by
      mistake, passed across his mind he hemmed deprecatingly, smiled blandly,
      remained silent for a few seconds; and finally inquired, 'What do you wish
      me to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you,' replied Miss Julia-'I'll tell you in three words. Dear
      Lord Peter-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the young man, I suppose-' interrupted the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the young Nobleman,' replied the lady, with a great stress on the
      last word. 'Dear Lord Peter is considerably afraid of the resentment of
      his family; and we have therefore thought it better to make the match a
      stolen one. He left town, to avoid suspicion, on a visit to his friend,
      the Honourable Augustus Flair, whose seat, as you know, is about thirty
      miles from this, accompanied only by his favourite tiger. We arranged that
      I should come here alone in the London coach; and that he, leaving his
      tiger and cab behind him, should come on, and arrive here as soon as
      possible this afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' observed Joseph Overton, 'and then he can order the chaise,
      and you can go on to Gretna Green together, without requiring the presence
      or interference of a third party, can't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' replied Miss Julia. 'We have every reason to believe-dear Lord Peter
      not being considered very prudent or sagacious by his friends, and they
      having discovered his attachment to me-that, immediately on his absence
      being observed, pursuit will be made in this direction:-to elude which,
      and to prevent our being traced, I wish it to be understood in this house,
      that dear Lord Peter is slightly deranged, though perfectly harmless; and
      that I am, unknown to him, awaiting his arrival to convey him in a
      post-chaise to a private asylum-at Berwick, say. If I don't show myself
      much, I dare say I can manage to pass for his mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought occurred to the mayor's mind that the lady might show herself
      a good deal without fear of detection; seeing that she was about double
      the age of her intended husband. He said nothing, however, and the lady
      proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'With the whole of this arrangement dear Lord Peter is acquainted; and all
      I want you to do, is, to make the delusion more complete by giving it the
      sanction of your influence in this place, and assigning this as a reason
      to the people of the house for my taking the young gentleman away. As it
      would not be consistent with the story that I should see him until after
      he has entered the chaise, I also wish you to communicate with him, and
      inform him that it is all going on well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has he arrived?' inquired Overton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know,' replied the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then how am I to know!' inquired the mayor. 'Of course he will not give
      his own name at the bar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I begged him, immediately on his arrival, to write you a note,' replied
      Miss Manners; 'and to prevent the possibility of our project being
      discovered through its means, I desired him to write anonymously, and in
      mysterious terms, to acquaint you with the number of his room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless me!' exclaimed the mayor, rising from his seat, and searching his
      pockets-'most extraordinary circumstance-he has arrived-mysterious note
      left at my house in a most mysterious manner, just before yours-didn't
      know what to make of it before, and certainly shouldn't have attended to
      it.-Oh! here it is.' And Joseph Overton pulled out of an inner coat-
      pocket the identical letter penned by Alexander Trott. 'Is this his
      lordship's hand?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes,' replied Julia; 'good, punctual creature! I have not seen it more
      than once or twice, but I know he writes very badly and very large. These
      dear, wild young noblemen, you know, Overton-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, ay, I see,' replied the mayor.-'Horses and dogs, play and
      wine-grooms, actresses, and cigars-the stable, the green-room, the saloon,
      and the tavern; and the legislative assembly at last.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's what he says,' pursued the mayor; '"Sir,-A young gentleman in
      number nineteen at the Winglebury Arms, is bent on committing a rash act
      to-morrow morning at an early hour." (That's good-he means marrying.) "If
      you have any regard for the peace of this town, or the preservation of
      one-it may be two-human lives"-What the deuce does he mean by that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That he's so anxious for the ceremony, he will expire if it's put off,
      and that I may possibly do the same,' replied the lady with great
      complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! I see-not much fear of that;-well-"two human lives, you will cause
      him to be removed to-night." (He wants to start at once.) "Fear not to do
      this on your responsibility: for to-morrow the absolute necessity of the
      proceeding will be but too apparent. Remember: number nineteen. The name
      is Trott. No delay; for life and death depend upon your promptitude."
      Passionate language, certainly. Shall I see him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do,' replied Miss Julia; 'and entreat him to act his part well. I am half
      afraid of him. Tell him to be cautious.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' said the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Settle all the arrangements.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' said the mayor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And say I think the chaise had better be ordered for one o'clock.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' said the mayor once more; and, ruminating on the absurdity of
      the situation in which fate and old acquaintance had placed him, he
      desired a waiter to herald his approach to the temporary representative of
      number nineteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement, 'Gentleman to speak with you, sir,' induced Mr. Trott to
      pause half-way in the glass of port, the contents of which he was in the
      act of imbibing at the moment; to rise from his chair; and retreat a few
      paces towards the window, as if to secure a retreat, in the event of the
      visitor assuming the form and appearance of Horace Hunter. One glance at
      Joseph Overton, however, quieted his apprehensions. He courteously
      motioned the stranger to a seat. The waiter, after a little jingling with
      the decanter and glasses, consented to leave the room; and Joseph Overton,
      placing the broad-brimmed hat on the chair next him, and bending his body
      gently forward, opened the business by saying in a very low and cautious
      tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh?' said Mr. Alexander Trott, in a loud key, with the vacant and
      mystified stare of a chilly somnambulist.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush-hush!' said the cautious attorney: 'to be sure-quite right-no titles
      here-my name is Overton, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Overton?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes: the mayor of this place-you sent me a letter with anonymous
      information, this afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I, sir?' exclaimed Trott with ill-dissembled surprise; for, coward as he
      was, he would willingly have repudiated the authorship of the letter in
      question. 'I, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you, sir; did you not?' responded Overton, annoyed with what he
      supposed to be an extreme degree of unnecessary suspicion. 'Either this
      letter is yours, or it is not. If it be, we can converse securely upon the
      subject at once. If it be not, of course I have no more to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stay, stay,' said Trott, 'it is mine; I did write it. What could I do,
      sir? I had no friend here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure, to be sure,' said the mayor, encouragingly, 'you could not
      have managed it better. Well, sir; it will be necessary for you to leave
      here to-night in a post-chaise and four. And the harder the boys drive,
      the better. You are not safe from pursuit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless me!' exclaimed Trott, in an agony of apprehension, 'can such things
      happen in a country like this? Such unrelenting and cold-blooded
      hostility!' He wiped off the concentrated essence of cowardice that was
      oozing fast down his forehead, and looked aghast at Joseph Overton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It certainly is a very hard case,' replied the mayor with a smile, 'that,
      in a free country, people can't marry whom they like, without being hunted
      down as if they were criminals. However, in the present instance the lady
      is willing, you know, and that's the main point, after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lady willing,' repeated Trott, mechanically. 'How do you know the lady's
      willing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, that's a good one,' said the mayor, benevolently tapping Mr. Trott
      on the arm with his broad-brimmed hat; 'I have known her, well, for a long
      time; and if anybody could entertain the remotest doubt on the subject, I
      assure you I have none, nor need you have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me!' said Mr. Trott, ruminating. 'This is very extraordinary!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Lord Peter,' said the mayor, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Peter?' repeated Mr. Trott.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-ah, I forgot. Mr. Trott, then-Trott-very good, ha! ha!-Well, sir, the
      chaise shall be ready at half-past twelve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what is to become of me until then?' inquired Mr. Trott, anxiously.
      'Wouldn't it save appearances, if I were placed under some restraint?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' replied Overton, 'very good thought-capital idea indeed. I'll send
      somebody up directly. And if you make a little resistance when we put you
      in the chaise it wouldn't be amiss-look as if you didn't want to be taken
      away, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure,' said Trott-'to be sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my lord,' said Overton, in a low tone, 'until then, I wish your
      lordship a good evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord-lordship?' ejaculated Trott again, falling back a step or two, and
      gazing, in unutterable wonder, on the countenance of the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha-ha! I see, my lord-practising the madman?-very good indeed-very vacant
      look-capital, my lord, capital-good evening, Mr.-Trott-ha! ha! ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That mayor's decidedly drunk,' soliloquised Mr. Trott, throwing himself
      back in his chair, in an attitude of reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is a much cleverer fellow than I thought him, that young nobleman-he
      carries it off uncommonly well,' thought Overton, as he went his way to
      the bar, there to complete his arrangements. This was soon done. Every
      word of the story was implicitly believed, and the one-eyed boots was
      immediately instructed to repair to number nineteen, to act as custodian
      of the person of the supposed lunatic until half-past twelve o'clock. In
      pursuance of this direction, that somewhat eccentric gentleman armed
      himself with a walking-stick of gigantic dimensions, and repaired, with
      his usual equanimity of manner, to Mr. Trott's apartment, which he entered
      without any ceremony, and mounted guard in, by quietly depositing himself
      on a chair near the door, where he proceeded to beguile the time by
      whistling a popular air with great apparent satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you want here, you scoundrel?' exclaimed Mr. Alexander Trott,
      with a proper appearance of indignation at his detention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boots beat time with his head, as he looked gently round at Mr. Trott
      with a smile of pity, and whistled an adagio movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you attend in this room by Mr. Overton's desire?' inquired Trott,
      rather astonished at the man's demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Keep yourself to yourself, young feller,' calmly responded the boots,
      'and don't say nothing to nobody.' And he whistled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now mind!' ejaculated Mr. Trott, anxious to keep up the farce of wishing
      with great earnestness to fight a duel if they'd let him. 'I protest
      against being kept here. I deny that I have any intention of fighting with
      anybody. But as it's useless contending with superior numbers, I shall sit
      quietly down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd better,' observed the placid boots, shaking the large stick
      expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Under protest, however,' added Alexander Trott, seating himself with
      indignation in his face, but great content in his heart. 'Under protest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, certainly!' responded the boots; 'anything you please. If you're
      happy, I'm transported; only don't talk too much-it'll make you worse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Make me worse?' exclaimed Trott, in unfeigned astonishment: 'the man's
      drunk!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd better be quiet, young feller,' remarked the boots, going through a
      threatening piece of pantomime with the stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or mad!' said Mr. Trott, rather alarmed. 'Leave the room, sir, and tell
      them to send somebody else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't do!' replied the boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Leave the room!' shouted Trott, ringing the bell violently: for he began
      to be alarmed on a new score.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Leave that 'ere bell alone, you wretched loo-nattic!' said the boots,
      suddenly forcing the unfortunate Trott back into his chair, and
      brandishing the stick aloft. 'Be quiet, you miserable object, and don't
      let everybody know there's a madman in the house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is a madman! He is a madman!' exclaimed the terrified Mr. Trott,
      gazing on the one eye of the red-headed boots with a look of abject
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Madman!' replied the boots, 'dam'me, I think he is a madman with a
      vengeance! Listen to me, you unfortunate. Ah! would you?' [a slight tap on
      the head with the large stick, as Mr. Trott made another move towards the
      bell-handle] 'I caught you there! did I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Spare my life!' exclaimed Trott, raising his hands imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want your life,' replied the boots, disdainfully, 'though I think
      it 'ud be a charity if somebody took it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, it wouldn't,' interrupted poor Mr. Trott, hurriedly, 'no, no, it
      wouldn't! I-I-'d rather keep it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O werry well,' said the boots: 'that's a mere matter of taste-ev'ry one
      to his liking. Hows'ever, all I've got to say is this here: You sit
      quietly down in that chair, and I'll sit hoppersite you here, and if you
      keep quiet and don't stir, I won't damage you; but, if you move hand or
      foot till half-past twelve o'clock, I shall alter the expression of your
      countenance so completely, that the next time you look in the glass you'll
      ask vether you're gone out of town, and ven you're likely to come back
      again. So sit down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will-I will,' responded the victim of mistakes; and down sat Mr. Trott
      and down sat the boots too, exactly opposite him, with the stick ready for
      immediate action in case of emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long and dreary were the hours that followed. The bell of Great Winglebury
      church had just struck ten, and two hours and a half would probably elapse
      before succour arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour, the noise occasioned by shutting up the shops in the
      street beneath, betokened something like life in the town, and rendered
      Mr. Trott's situation a little less insupportable; but, when even these
      ceased, and nothing was heard beyond the occasional rattling of a post-
      chaise as it drove up the yard to change horses, and then drove away
      again, or the clattering of horses' hoofs in the stables behind, it became
      almost unbearable. The boots occasionally moved an inch or two, to knock
      superfluous bits of wax off the candles, which were burning low, but
      instantaneously resumed his former position; and as he remembered to have
      heard, somewhere or other, that the human eye had an unfailing effect in
      controlling mad people, he kept his solitary organ of vision constantly
      fixed on Mr. Alexander Trott. That unfortunate individual stared at his
      companion in his turn, until his features grew more and more
      indistinct-his hair gradually less red-and the room more misty and
      obscure. Mr. Alexander Trott fell into a sound sleep, from which he was
      awakened by a rumbling in the street, and a cry of 'Chaise- and-four for
      number twenty-five!' A bustle on the stairs succeeded; the room door was
      hastily thrown open; and Mr. Joseph Overton entered, followed by four
      stout waiters, and Mrs. Williamson, the stout landlady of the Winglebury
      Arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Overton!' exclaimed Mr. Alexander Trott, jumping up in a frenzy.
      'Look at this man, sir; consider the situation in which I have been placed
      for three hours past-the person you sent to guard me, sir, was a madman-a
      madman-a raging, ravaging, furious madman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bravo!' whispered Mr. Overton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor dear!' said the compassionate Mrs. Williamson, 'mad people always
      thinks other people's mad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor dear!' ejaculated Mr. Alexander Trott. 'What the devil do you mean
      by poor dear! Are you the landlady of this house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes,' replied the stout old lady, 'don't exert yourself, there's a
      dear! Consider your health, now; do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exert myself!' shouted Mr. Alexander Trott; 'it's a mercy, ma'am, that I
      have any breath to exert myself with! I might have been assassinated three
      hours ago by that one-eyed monster with the oakum head. How dare you have
      a madman, ma'am-how dare you have a madman, to assault and terrify the
      visitors to your house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll never have another,' said Mrs. Williamson, casting a look of
      reproach at the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital, capital,' whispered Overton again, as he enveloped Mr. Alexander
      Trott in a thick travelling-cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital, sir!' exclaimed Trott, aloud; 'it's horrible. The very
      recollection makes me shudder. I'd rather fight four duels in three hours,
      if I survived the first three, than I'd sit for that time face to face
      with a madman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Keep it up, my lord, as you go down-stairs,' whispered Overton, 'your
      bill is paid, and your portmanteau in the chaise.' And then he added
      aloud, 'Now, waiters, the gentleman's ready.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At this signal, the waiters crowded round Mr. Alexander Trott. One took
      one arm; another, the other; a third, walked before with a candle; the
      fourth, behind with another candle; the boots and Mrs. Williamson brought
      up the rear; and down-stairs they went: Mr. Alexander Trott expressing
      alternately at the very top of his voice either his feigned reluctance to
      go, or his unfeigned indignation at being shut up with a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Overton was waiting at the chaise-door, the boys were ready mounted,
      and a few ostlers and stable nondescripts were standing round to witness
      the departure of 'the mad gentleman.' Mr. Alexander Trott's foot was on
      the step, when he observed (which the dim light had prevented his doing
      before) a figure seated in the chaise, closely muffled up in a cloak like
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's that?' he inquired of Overton, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush, hush,' replied the mayor: 'the other party of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The other party!' exclaimed Trott, with an effort to retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes; you'll soon find that out, before you go far, I should
      think-but make a noise, you'll excite suspicion if you whisper to me so
      much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't go in this chaise!' shouted Mr. Alexander Trott, all his original
      fears recurring with tenfold violence. 'I shall be assassinated-I shall
      be-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bravo, bravo,' whispered Overton. 'I'll push you in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I won't go,' exclaimed Mr. Trott. 'Help here, help! They're carrying
      me away against my will. This is a plot to murder me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor dear!' said Mrs. Williamson again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, boys, put 'em along,' cried the mayor, pushing Trott in and slamming
      the door. 'Off with you, as quick as you can, and stop for nothing till
      you come to the next stage-all right!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Horses are paid, Tom,' screamed Mrs. Williamson; and away went the
      chaise, at the rate of fourteen miles an hour, with Mr. Alexander Trott
      and Miss Julia Manners carefully shut up in the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alexander Trott remained coiled up in one corner of the chaise, and
      his mysterious companion in the other, for the first two or three miles;
      Mr. Trott edging more and more into his corner, as he felt his companion
      gradually edging more and more from hers; and vainly endeavouring in the
      darkness to catch a glimpse of the furious face of the supposed Horace
      Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We may speak now,' said his fellow-traveller, at length; 'the post-boys
      can neither see nor hear us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's not Hunter's voice!'-thought Alexander, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Lord Peter!' said Miss Julia, most winningly: putting her arm on Mr.
      Trott's shoulder. 'Dear Lord Peter. Not a word?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, it's a woman!' exclaimed Mr. Trott, in a low tone of excessive
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! Whose voice is that?' said Julia; ''tis not Lord Peter's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,-it's mine,' replied Mr. Trott.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yours!' ejaculated Miss Julia Manners; 'a strange man! Gracious heaven!
      How came you here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whoever you are, you might have known that I came against my will,
      ma'am,' replied Alexander, 'for I made noise enough when I got in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you come from Lord Peter?' inquired Miss Manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Confound Lord Peter,' replied Trott pettishly. 'I don't know any Lord
      Peter. I never heard of him before to-night, when I've been Lord Peter'd
      by one and Lord Peter'd by another, till I verily believe I'm mad, or
      dreaming-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whither are we going?' inquired the lady tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How should I know, ma'am?' replied Trott with singular coolness; for the
      events of the evening had completely hardened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop stop!' cried the lady, letting down the front glasses of the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stay, my dear ma'am!' said Mr. Trott, pulling the glasses up again with
      one hand, and gently squeezing Miss Julia's waist with the other. 'There
      is some mistake here; give me till the end of this stage to explain my
      share of it. We must go so far; you cannot be set down here alone, at this
      hour of the night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady consented; the mistake was mutually explained. Mr. Trott was a
      young man, had highly promising whiskers, an undeniable tailor, and an
      insinuating address-he wanted nothing but valour, and who wants that with
      three thousand a-year? The lady had this, and more; she wanted a young
      husband, and the only course open to Mr. Trott to retrieve his disgrace
      was a rich wife. So, they came to the conclusion that it would be a pity
      to have all this trouble and expense for nothing; and that as they were so
      far on the road already, they had better go to Gretna Green, and marry
      each other; and they did so. And the very next preceding entry in the
      Blacksmith's book, was an entry of the marriage of Emily Brown with Horace
      Hunter. Mr. Hunter took his wife home, and begged pardon, and was
      pardoned; and Mr. Trott took his wife home, begged pardon too, and was
      pardoned also. And Lord Peter, who had been detained beyond his time by
      drinking champagne and riding a steeple- chase, went back to the
      Honourable Augustus Flair's, and drank more champagne, and rode another
      steeple-chase, and was thrown and killed. And Horace Hunter took great
      credit to himself for practising on the cowardice of Alexander Trott; and
      all these circumstances were discovered in time, and carefully noted down;
      and if you ever stop a week at the Winglebury Arms, they will give you
      just this account of The Great Winglebury Duel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX-MRS. JOSEPH PORTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most extensive were the preparations at Rose Villa, Clapham Rise, in the
      occupation of Mr. Gattleton (a stock-broker in especially comfortable
      circumstances), and great was the anxiety of Mr. Gattleton's interesting
      family, as the day fixed for the representation of the Private Play which
      had been 'many months in preparation,' approached. The whole family was
      infected with the mania for Private Theatricals; the house, usually so
      clean and tidy, was, to use Mr. Gattleton's expressive description,
      'regularly turned out o' windows;' the large dining-room, dismantled of
      its furniture, and ornaments, presented a strange jumble of flats, flies,
      wings, lamps, bridges, clouds, thunder and lightning, festoons and
      flowers, daggers and foil, and various other messes in theatrical slang
      included under the comprehensive name of 'properties.' The bedrooms were
      crowded with scenery, the kitchen was occupied by carpenters. Rehearsals
      took place every other night in the drawing- room, and every sofa in the
      house was more or less damaged by the perseverance and spirit with which
      Mr. Sempronius Gattleton, and Miss Lucina, rehearsed the smothering scene
      in 'Othello'-it having been determined that that tragedy should form the
      first portion of the evening's entertainments.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When we're a leetle more perfect, I think it will go admirably,' said Mr.
      Sempronius, addressing his corps dramatique, at the conclusion of the
      hundred and fiftieth rehearsal. In consideration of his sustaining the
      trifling inconvenience of bearing all the expenses of the play, Mr.
      Sempronius had been, in the most handsome manner, unanimously elected
      stage-manager. 'Evans,' continued Mr. Gattleton, the younger, addressing a
      tall, thin, pale young gentleman, with extensive whiskers-'Evans, you play
      Roderigo beautifully.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Beautifully,' echoed the three Miss Gattletons; for Mr. Evans was
      pronounced by all his lady friends to be 'quite a dear.' He looked so
      interesting, and had such lovely whiskers: to say nothing of his talent
      for writing verses in albums and playing the flute! Roderigo simpered and
      bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I think,' added the manager, 'you are hardly perfect in the-fall-in
      the fencing-scene, where you are-you understand?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's very difficult,' said Mr. Evans, thoughtfully; 'I've fallen about, a
      good deal, in our counting-house lately, for practice, only I find it
      hurts one so. Being obliged to fall backward you see, it bruises one's
      head a good deal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you must take care you don't knock a wing down,' said Mr. Gattleton,
      the elder, who had been appointed prompter, and who took as much interest
      in the play as the youngest of the company. 'The stage is very narrow, you
      know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! don't be afraid,' said Mr. Evans, with a very self-satisfied air; 'I
      shall fall with my head "off," and then I can't do any harm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, egad,' said the manager, rubbing his hands, 'we shall make a decided
      hit in "Masaniello." Harleigh sings that music admirably.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody echoed the sentiment. Mr. Harleigh smiled, and looked
      foolish-not an unusual thing with him-hummed' Behold how brightly breaks
      the morning,' and blushed as red as the fisherman's nightcap he was trying
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let's see,' resumed the manager, telling the number on his fingers, 'we
      shall have three dancing female peasants, besides Fenella, and four
      fishermen. Then, there's our man Tom; he can have a pair of ducks of mine,
      and a check shirt of Bob's, and a red nightcap, and he'll do for
      another-that's five. In the choruses, of course, we can sing at the sides;
      and in the market-scene we can walk about in cloaks and things. When the
      revolt takes place, Tom must keep rushing in on one side and out on the
      other, with a pickaxe, as fast as he can. The effect will be electrical;
      it will look exactly as if there were an immense number of 'em. And in the
      eruption-scene we must burn the red fire, and upset the tea-trays, and
      make all sorts of noises-and it's sure to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure! sure!' cried all the performers unAc voce-and away hurried Mr.
      Sempronius Gattleton to wash the burnt cork off his face, and superintend
      the 'setting up' of some of the amateur-painted, but never-
      sufficiently-to-be-admired, scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gattleton was a kind, good-tempered, vulgar soul, exceedingly fond of
      her husband and children, and entertaining only three dislikes. In the
      first place, she had a natural antipathy to anybody else's unmarried
      daughters; in the second, she was in bodily fear of anything in the shape
      of ridicule; lastly-almost a necessary consequence of this feeling-she
      regarded, with feelings of the utmost horror, one Mrs. Joseph Porter over
      the way. However, the good folks of Clapham and its vicinity stood very
      much in awe of scandal and sarcasm; and thus Mrs. Joseph Porter was
      courted, and flattered, and caressed, and invited, for much the same
      reason that induces a poor author, without a farthing in his pocket, to
      behave with extraordinary civility to a twopenny postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind, ma,' said Miss Emma Porter, in colloquy with her respected
      relative, and trying to look unconcerned; 'if they had invited me, you
      know that neither you nor pa would have allowed me to take part in such an
      exhibition.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just what I should have thought from your high sense of propriety,'
      returned the mother. 'I am glad to see, Emma, you know how to designate
      the proceeding.' Miss P., by-the-bye, had only the week before made 'an
      exhibition' of herself for four days, behind a counter at a fancy fair, to
      all and every of her Majesty's liege subjects who were disposed to pay a
      shilling each for the privilege of seeing some four dozen girls flirting
      with strangers, and playing at shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There!' said Mrs. Porter, looking out of window; 'there are two rounds of
      beef and a ham going in-clearly for sandwiches; and Thomas, the
      pastry-cook, says, there have been twelve dozen tarts ordered, besides
      blancmange and jellies. Upon my word! think of the Miss Gattletons in
      fancy dresses, too!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it's too ridiculous!' said Miss Porter, hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll manage to put them a little out of conceit with the business,
      however,' said Mrs. Porter; and out she went on her charitable errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my dear Mrs. Gattleton,' said Mrs. Joseph Porter, after they had
      been closeted for some time, and when, by dint of indefatigable pumping,
      she had managed to extract all the news about the play, 'well, my dear,
      people may say what they please; indeed we know they will, for some folks
      are so ill-natured. Ah, my dear Miss Lucina, how d'ye do? I was just
      telling your mamma that I have heard it said, that-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Porter is alluding to the play, my dear,' said Mrs. Gattleton; 'she
      was, I am sorry to say, just informing me that-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, now pray don't mention it,' interrupted Mrs. Porter; 'it's most
      absurd-quite as absurd as young What's-his-name saying he wondered how
      Miss Caroline, with such a foot and ankle, could have the vanity to play
      Fenella.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Highly impertinent, whoever said it,' said Mrs. Gattleton, bridling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, my dear,' chimed in the delighted Mrs. Porter; 'most
      undoubtedly! Because, as I said, if Miss Caroline does play Fenella, it
      doesn't follow, as a matter of course, that she should think she has a
      pretty foot;-and then-such puppies as these young men are-he had the
      impudence to say, that-'
    </p>
    <p>
      How far the amiable Mrs. Porter might have succeeded in her pleasant
      purpose, it is impossible to say, had not the entrance of Mr. Thomas
      Balderstone, Mrs. Gattleton's brother, familiarly called in the family
      'Uncle Tom,' changed the course of conversation, and suggested to her mind
      an excellent plan of operation on the evening of the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Tom was very rich, and exceedingly fond of his nephews and nieces:
      as a matter of course, therefore, he was an object of great importance in
      his own family. He was one of the best-hearted men in existence: always in
      a good temper, and always talking. It was his boast that he wore top-boots
      on all occasions, and had never worn a black silk neckerchief; and it was
      his pride that he remembered all the principal plays of Shakspeare from
      beginning to end-and so he did. The result of this parrot-like
      accomplishment was, that he was not only perpetually quoting himself, but
      that he could never sit by, and hear a misquotation from the 'Swan of
      Avon' without setting the unfortunate delinquent right. He was also
      something of a wag; never missed an opportunity of saying what he
      considered a good thing, and invariably laughed until he cried at anything
      that appeared to him mirth-moving or ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, girls!' said Uncle Tom, after the preparatory ceremony of kissing
      and how-d'ye-do-ing had been gone through-'how d'ye get on? Know your
      parts, eh?-Lucina, my dear, act II., scene I-place, left-cue-"Unknown
      fate,"-What's next, eh?-Go on-"The Heavens-"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes,' said Miss Lucina, 'I recollect-
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even
      as our days do grow!"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Make a pause here and there,' said the old gentleman, who was a great
      critic. '"But that our loves and comforts should increase"-emphasis on the
      last syllable, "crease,"-loud "even,"-one, two, three, four; then loud
      again, "as our days do grow;" emphasis on days. That's the way, my dear;
      trust to your uncle for emphasis. Ah! Sem, my boy, how are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, thankee, uncle,' returned Mr. Sempronius, who had just
      appeared, looking something like a ringdove, with a small circle round
      each eye: the result of his constant corking. 'Of course we see you on
      Thursday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, of course, my dear boy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a pity it is your nephew didn't think of making you prompter, Mr.
      Balderstone!' whispered Mrs. Joseph Porter; 'you would have been
      invaluable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I flatter myself, I should have been tolerably up to the thing,'
      responded Uncle Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must bespeak sitting next you on the night,' resumed Mrs. Porter; 'and
      then, if our dear young friends here, should be at all wrong, you will be
      able to enlighten me. I shall be so interested.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sure I shall be most happy to give you any assistance in my power'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mind, it's a bargain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know how it is,' said Mrs. Gattleton to her daughters, as they
      were sitting round the fire in the evening, looking over their parts, 'but
      I really very much wish Mrs. Joseph Porter wasn't coming on Thursday. I am
      sure she's scheming something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She can't make us ridiculous, however,' observed Mr. Sempronius
      Gattleton, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long-looked-for Thursday arrived in due course, and brought with it,
      as Mr. Gattleton, senior, philosophically observed, 'no disappointments,
      to speak of.' True, it was yet a matter of doubt whether Cassio would be
      enabled to get into the dress which had been sent for him from the
      masquerade warehouse. It was equally uncertain whether the principal
      female singer would be sufficiently recovered from the influenza to make
      her appearance; Mr. Harleigh, the Masaniello of the night, was hoarse, and
      rather unwell, in consequence of the great quantity of lemon and
      sugar-candy he had eaten to improve his voice; and two flutes and a
      violoncello had pleaded severe colds. What of that? the audience were all
      coming. Everybody knew his part: the dresses were covered with tinsel and
      spangles; the white plumes looked beautiful; Mr. Evans had practised
      falling until he was bruised from head to foot and quite perfect; Iago was
      sure that, in the stabbing-scene, he should make 'a decided hit.' A
      self-taught deaf gentleman, who had kindly offered to bring his flute,
      would be a most valuable addition to the orchestra; Miss Jenkins's talent
      for the piano was too well known to be doubted for an instant; Mr. Cape
      had practised the violin accompaniment with her frequently; and Mr. Brown,
      who had kindly undertaken, at a few hours' notice, to bring his
      violoncello, would, no doubt, manage extremely well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven o'clock came, and so did the audience; all the rank and fashion of
      Clapham and its vicinity was fast filling the theatre. There were the
      Smiths, the Gubbinses, the Nixons, the Dixons, the Hicksons, people with
      all sorts of names, two aldermen, a sheriff in perspective, Sir Thomas
      Glumper (who had been knighted in the last reign for carrying up an
      address on somebody's escaping from nothing); and last, not least, there
      were Mrs. Joseph Porter and Uncle Tom, seated in the centre of the third
      row from the stage; Mrs. P. amusing Uncle Tom with all sorts of stories,
      and Uncle Tom amusing every one else by laughing most immoderately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ting, ting, ting! went the prompter's bell at eight o'clock precisely, and
      dash went the orchestra into the overture to 'The Men of Prometheus.' The
      pianoforte player hammered away with laudable perseverance; and the
      violoncello, which struck in at intervals, 'sounded very well,
      considering.' The unfortunate individual, however, who had undertaken to
      play the flute accompaniment 'at sight,' found, from fatal experience, the
      perfect truth of the old adage, 'ought of sight, out of mind;' for being
      very near-sighted, and being placed at a considerable distance from his
      music-book, all he had an opportunity of doing was to play a bar now and
      then in the wrong place, and put the other performers out. It is, however,
      but justice to Mr. Brown to say that he did this to admiration. The
      overture, in fact, was not unlike a race between the different
      instruments; the piano came in first by several bars, and the violoncello
      next, quite distancing the poor flute; for the deaf gentleman too-too'd
      away, quite unconscious that he was at all wrong, until apprised, by the
      applause of the audience, that the overture was concluded. A considerable
      bustle and shuffling of feet was then heard upon the stage, accompanied by
      whispers of 'Here's a pretty go!-what's to be done?' &amp;c. The audience
      applauded again, by way of raising the spirits of the performers; and then
      Mr. Sempronius desired the prompter, in a very audible voice, to 'clear
      the stage, and ring up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ting, ting, ting! went the bell again. Everybody sat down; the curtain
      shook; rose sufficiently high to display several pair of yellow boots
      paddling about; and there remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ting, ting, ting! went the bell again. The curtain was violently
      convulsed, but rose no higher; the audience tittered; Mrs. Porter looked
      at Uncle Tom; Uncle Tom looked at everybody, rubbing his hands, and
      laughing with perfect rapture. After as much ringing with the little bell
      as a muffin-boy would make in going down a tolerably long street, and a
      vast deal of whispering, hammering, and calling for nails and cord, the
      curtain at length rose, and discovered Mr. Sempronius Gattleton solus, and
      decked for Othello. After three distinct rounds of applause, during which
      Mr. Sempronius applied his right hand to his left breast, and bowed in the
      most approved manner, the manager advanced and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ladies and Gentlemen-I assure you it is with sincere regret, that I
      regret to be compelled to inform you, that Iago who was to have played Mr.
      Wilson-I beg your pardon, Ladies and Gentlemen, but I am naturally
      somewhat agitated (applause)-I mean, Mr. Wilson, who was to have played
      Iago, is-that is, has been-or, in other words, Ladies and Gentlemen, the
      fact is, that I have just received a note, in which I am informed that
      Iago is unavoidably detained at the Post-office this evening. Under these
      circumstances, I trust-a-a-amateur performance-a-another gentleman
      undertaken to read the part-request indulgence for a short time-courtesy
      and kindness of a British audience.' Overwhelming applause. Exit Mr.
      Sempronius Gattleton, and curtain falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience were, of course, exceedingly good-humoured; the whole
      business was a joke; and accordingly they waited for an hour with the
      utmost patience, being enlivened by an interlude of rout-cakes and
      lemonade. It appeared by Mr. Sempronius's subsequent explanation, that the
      delay would not have been so great, had it not so happened that when the
      substitute Iago had finished dressing, and just as the play was on the
      point of commencing, the original Iago unexpectedly arrived. The former
      was therefore compelled to undress, and the latter to dress for his part;
      which, as he found some difficulty in getting into his clothes, occupied
      no inconsiderable time. At last, the tragedy began in real earnest. It
      went off well enough, until the third scene of the first act, in which
      Othello addresses the Senate: the only remarkable circumstance being, that
      as Iago could not get on any of the stage boots, in consequence of his
      feet being violently swelled with the heat and excitement, he was under
      the necessity of playing the part in a pair of Wellingtons, which
      contrasted rather oddly with his richly embroidered pantaloons. When
      Othello started with his address to the Senate (whose dignity was
      represented by, the Duke, a carpenter, two men engaged on the
      recommendation of the gardener, and a boy), Mrs. Porter found the
      opportunity she so anxiously sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sempronius proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and approv'd
      good masters, That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, It is most
      true;-rude am I in my speech-"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that right?' whispered Mrs. Porter to Uncle Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell him so, then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will. Sem!' called out Uncle Tom, 'that's wrong, my boy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's wrong, uncle?' demanded Othello, quite forgetting the dignity of
      his situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've left out something. "True I have married-"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, ah!' said Mr. Sempronius, endeavouring to hide his confusion as much
      and as ineffectually as the audience attempted to conceal their
      half-suppressed tittering, by coughing with extraordinary violence-
    </p>
    <p>
      -'"true I have married her;- The very head and front of my offending Hath
      this extent; no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      (Aside) Why don't you prompt, father?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I've mislaid my spectacles,' said poor Mr. Gattleton, almost dead
      with the heat and bustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There, now it's "rude am I,"' said Uncle Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know it is,' returned the unfortunate manager, proceeding with his
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be useless and tiresome to quote the number of instances in which
      Uncle Tom, now completely in his element, and instigated by the
      mischievous Mrs. Porter, corrected the mistakes of the performers; suffice
      it to say, that having mounted his hobby, nothing could induce him to
      dismount; so, during the whole remainder of the play, he performed a kind
      of running accompaniment, by muttering everybody's part as it was being
      delivered, in an under-tone. The audience were highly amused, Mrs. Porter
      delighted, the performers embarrassed; Uncle Tom never was better pleased
      in all his life; and Uncle Tom's nephews and nieces had never, although
      the declared heirs to his large property, so heartily wished him gathered
      to his fathers as on that memorable occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several other minor causes, too, united to damp the ardour of the dramatis
      personae. None of the performers could walk in their tights, or move their
      arms in their jackets; the pantaloons were too small, the boots too large,
      and the swords of all shapes and sizes. Mr. Evans, naturally too tall for
      the scenery, wore a black velvet hat with immense white plumes, the glory
      of which was lost in 'the flies;' and the only other inconvenience of
      which was, that when it was off his head he could not put it on, and when
      it was on he could not take it off. Notwithstanding all his practice, too,
      he fell with his head and shoulders as neatly through one of the side
      scenes, as a harlequin would jump through a panel in a Christmas
      pantomime. The pianoforte player, overpowered by the extreme heat of the
      room, fainted away at the commencement of the entertainments, leaving the
      music of 'Masaniello' to the flute and violoncello. The orchestra
      complained that Mr. Harleigh put them out, and Mr. Harleigh declared that
      the orchestra prevented his singing a note. The fishermen, who were hired
      for the occasion, revolted to the very life, positively refusing to play
      without an increased allowance of spirits; and, their demand being
      complied with, getting drunk in the eruption-scene as naturally as
      possible. The red fire, which was burnt at the conclusion of the second
      act, not only nearly suffocated the audience, but nearly set the house on
      fire into the bargain; and, as it was, the remainder of the piece was
      acted in a thick fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the whole affair was, as Mrs. Joseph Porter triumphantly told
      everybody, 'a complete failure.' The audience went home at four o'clock in
      the morning, exhausted with laughter, suffering from severe headaches, and
      smelling terribly of brimstone and gunpowder. The Messrs. Gattleton,
      senior and junior, retired to rest, with the vague idea of emigrating to
      Swan River early in the ensuing week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose Villa has once again resumed its wonted appearance; the dining-room
      furniture has been replaced; the tables are as nicely polished as
      formerly; the horsehair chairs are ranged against the wall, as regularly
      as ever; Venetian blinds have been fitted to every window in the house to
      intercept the prying gaze of Mrs. Joseph Porter. The subject of
      theatricals is never mentioned in the Gattleton family, unless, indeed, by
      Uncle Tom, who cannot refrain from sometimes expressing his surprise and
      regret at finding that his nephews and nieces appear to have lost the
      relish they once possessed for the beauties of Shakspeare, and quotations
      from the works of that immortal bard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE FIRST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Matrimony is proverbially a serious undertaking. Like an over-weening
      predilection for brandy-and-water, it is a misfortune into which a man
      easily falls, and from which he finds it remarkably difficult to extricate
      himself. It is of no use telling a man who is timorous on these points,
      that it is but one plunge, and all is over. They say the same thing at the
      Old Bailey, and the unfortunate victims derive as much comfort from the
      assurance in the one case as in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle was a rather uncommon compound of strong uxorious
      inclinations, and an unparalleled degree of anti-connubial timidity. He
      was about fifty years of age; stood four feet six inches and three-
      quarters in his socks-for he never stood in stockings at all-plump, clean,
      and rosy. He looked something like a vignette to one of Richardson's
      novels, and had a clean-cravatish formality of manner, and
      kitchen-pokerness of carriage, which Sir Charles Grandison himself might
      have envied. He lived on an annuity, which was well adapted to the
      individual who received it, in one respect-it was rather small. He
      received it in periodical payments on every alternate Monday; but he ran
      himself out, about a day after the expiration of the first week, as
      regularly as an eight-day clock; and then, to make the comparison
      complete, his landlady wound him up, and he went on with a regular tick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle had long lived in a state of single blessedness, as
      bachelors say, or single cursedness, as spinsters think; but the idea of
      matrimony had never ceased to haunt him. Wrapt in profound reveries on
      this never-failing theme, fancy transformed his small parlour in Cecil-
      street, Strand, into a neat house in the suburbs; the half-hundredweight
      of coals under the kitchen-stairs suddenly sprang up into three tons of
      the best Walls-end; his small French bedstead was converted into a regular
      matrimonial four-poster; and in the empty chair on the opposite side of
      the fireplace, imagination seated a beautiful young lady, with a very
      little independence or will of her own, and a very large independence
      under a will of her father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's there?' inquired Mr. Watkins Tottle, as a gentle tap at his room-
      door disturbed these meditations one evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tottle, my dear fellow, how do you do?' said a short elderly gentleman
      with a gruffish voice, bursting into the room, and replying to the
      question by asking another.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Told you I should drop in some evening,' said the short gentleman, as he
      delivered his hat into Tottle's hand, after a little struggling and
      dodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Delighted to see you, I'm sure,' said Mr. Watkins Tottle, wishing
      internally that his visitor had 'dropped in' to the Thames at the bottom
      of the street, instead of dropping into his parlour. The fortnight was
      nearly up, and Watkins was hard up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How is Mrs. Gabriel Parsons?' inquired Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite well, thank you,' replied Mr. Gabriel Parsons, for that was the
      name the short gentleman revelled in. Here there was a pause; the short
      gentleman looked at the left hob of the fireplace; Mr. Watkins Tottle
      stared vacancy out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite well,' repeated the short gentleman, when five minutes had expired.
      'I may say remarkably well.' And he rubbed the palms of his hands as hard
      as if he were going to strike a light by friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What will you take?' inquired Tottle, with the desperate suddenness of a
      man who knew that unless the visitor took his leave, he stood very little
      chance of taking anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I don't know-have you any whiskey?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why,' replied Tottle, very slowly, for all this was gaining time, 'I had
      some capital, and remarkably strong whiskey last week; but it's all
      gone-and therefore its strength-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is much beyond proof; or, in other words, impossible to be proved,' said
      the short gentleman; and he laughed very heartily, and seemed quite glad
      the whiskey had been drunk. Mr. Tottle smiled-but it was the smile of
      despair. When Mr. Gabriel Parsons had done laughing, he delicately
      insinuated that, in the absence of whiskey, he would not be averse to
      brandy. And Mr. Watkins Tottle, lighting a flat candle very
      ostentatiously; and displaying an immense key, which belonged to the
      street-door, but which, for the sake of appearances, occasionally did duty
      in an imaginary wine-cellar; left the room to entreat his landlady to
      charge their glasses, and charge them in the bill. The application was
      successful; the spirits were speedily called-not from the vasty deep, but
      the adjacent wine-vaults. The two short gentlemen mixed their grog; and
      then sat cosily down before the fire-a pair of shorts, airing themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tottle,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, 'you know my way-off-hand, open, say
      what I mean, mean what I say, hate reserve, and can't bear affectation.
      One, is a bad domino which only hides what good people have about 'em,
      without making the bad look better; and the other is much about the same
      thing as pinking a white cotton stocking to make it look like a silk one.
      Now listen to what I'm going to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, the little gentleman paused, and took a long pull at his brandy-
      and-water. Mr. Watkins Tottle took a sip of his, stirred the fire, and
      assumed an air of profound attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's of no use humming and ha'ing about the matter,' resumed the short
      gentleman.-'You want to get married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why,' replied Mr. Watkins Tottle evasively; for he trembled violently,
      and felt a sudden tingling throughout his whole frame; 'why-I should
      certainly-at least, I think I should like-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't do,' said the short gentleman.-'Plain and free-or there's an end of
      the matter. Do you want money?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You admire the sex?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you'd like to be married?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you shall be. There's an end of that.' Thus saying, Mr. Gabriel
      Parsons took a pinch of snuff, and mixed another glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me entreat you to be more explanatory,' said Tottle. 'Really, as the
      party principally interested, I cannot consent to be disposed of, in this
      way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you,' replied Mr. Gabriel Parsons, warming with the subject,
      and the brandy-and-water-'I know a lady-she's stopping with my wife
      now-who is just the thing for you. Well educated; talks French; plays the
      piano; knows a good deal about flowers, and shells, and all that sort of
      thing; and has five hundred a year, with an uncontrolled power of
      disposing of it, by her last will and testament.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll pay my addresses to her,' said Mr. Watkins Tottle. 'She isn't very
      young-is she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not very; just the thing for you. I've said that already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What coloured hair has the lady?' inquired Mr. Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Egad, I hardly recollect,' replied Gabriel, with coolness. 'Perhaps I
      ought to have observed, at first, she wears a front.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A what?' ejaculated Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One of those things with curls, along here,' said Parsons, drawing a
      straight line across his forehead, just over his eyes, in illustration of
      his meaning. 'I know the front's black; I can't speak quite positively
      about her own hair; because, unless one walks behind her, and catches a
      glimpse of it under her bonnet, one seldom sees it; but I should say that
      it was rather lighter than the front-a shade of a greyish tinge, perhaps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle looked as if he had certain misgivings of mind. Mr.
      Gabriel Parsons perceived it, and thought it would be safe to begin the
      next attack without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, were you ever in love, Tottle?' he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle blushed up to the eyes, and down to the chin, and
      exhibited a most extensive combination of colours as he confessed the soft
      impeachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose you popped the question, more than once, when you were a
      young-I beg your pardon-a younger-man,' said Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never in my life!' replied his friend, apparently indignant at being
      suspected of such an act. 'Never! The fact is, that I entertain, as you
      know, peculiar opinions on these subjects. I am not afraid of ladies,
      young or old-far from it; but, I think, that in compliance with the custom
      of the present day, they allow too much freedom of speech and manner to
      marriageable men. Now, the fact is, that anything like this easy freedom I
      never could acquire; and as I am always afraid of going too far, I am
      generally, I dare say, considered formal and cold.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shouldn't wonder if you were,' replied Parsons, gravely; 'I shouldn't
      wonder. However, you'll be all right in this case; for the strictness and
      delicacy of this lady's ideas greatly exceed your own. Lord bless you,
      why, when she came to our house, there was an old portrait of some man or
      other, with two large, black, staring eyes, hanging up in her bedroom; she
      positively refused to go to bed there, till it was taken down, considering
      it decidedly wrong.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think so, too,' said Mr. Watkins Tottle; 'certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then, the other night-I never laughed so much in my life'-resumed Mr.
      Gabriel Parsons; 'I had driven home in an easterly wind, and caught a
      devil of a face-ache. Well; as Fanny-that's Mrs. Parsons, you know-and
      this friend of hers, and I, and Frank Ross, were playing a rubber, I said,
      jokingly, that when I went to bed I should wrap my head in Fanny's flannel
      petticoat. She instantly threw up her cards, and left the room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite right!' said Mr. Watkins Tottle; 'she could not possibly have
      behaved in a more dignified manner. What did you do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do?-Frank took dummy; and I won sixpence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, didn't you apologise for hurting her feelings?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Devil a bit. Next morning at breakfast, we talked it over. She contended
      that any reference to a flannel petticoat was improper;-men ought not to
      be supposed to know that such things were. I pleaded my coverture; being a
      married man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what did the lady say to that?' inquired Tottle, deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Changed her ground, and said that Frank being a single man, its
      impropriety was obvious.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Noble-minded creature!' exclaimed the enraptured Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! both Fanny and I said, at once, that she was regularly cut out for
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of placid satisfaction shone on the circular face of Mr. Watkins
      Tottle, as he heard the prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's one thing I can't understand,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, as he
      rose to depart; 'I cannot, for the life and soul of me, imagine how the
      deuce you'll ever contrive to come together. The lady would certainly go
      into convulsions if the subject were mentioned.' Mr. Gabriel Parsons sat
      down again, and laughed until he was weak. Tottle owed him money, so he
      had a perfect right to laugh at Tottle's expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle feared, in his own mind, that this was another
      characteristic which he had in common with this modern Lucretia. He,
      however, accepted the invitation to dine with the Parsonses on the next
      day but one, with great firmness: and looked forward to the introduction,
      when again left alone, with tolerable composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun that rose on the next day but one, had never beheld a sprucer
      personage on the outside of the Norwood stage, than Mr. Watkins Tottle;
      and when the coach drew up before a cardboard-looking house with disguised
      chimneys, and a lawn like a large sheet of green letter-paper, he
      certainly had never lighted to his place of destination a gentleman who
      felt more uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach stopped, and Mr. Watkins Tottle jumped-we beg his
      pardon-alighted, with great dignity. 'All right!' said he, and away went
      the coach up the hill with that beautiful equanimity of pace for which
      'short' stages are generally remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle gave a faltering jerk to the handle of the garden- gate
      bell. He essayed a more energetic tug, and his previous nervousness was
      not at all diminished by hearing the bell ringing like a fire alarum.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mr. Parsons at home?' inquired Tottle of the man who opened the gate.
      He could hardly hear himself speak, for the bell had not yet done tolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here I am,' shouted a voice on the lawn,-and there was Mr. Gabriel
      Parsons in a flannel jacket, running backwards and forwards, from a wicket
      to two hats piled on each other, and from the two hats to the wicket, in
      the most violent manner, while another gentleman with his coat off was
      getting down the area of the house, after a ball. When the gentleman
      without the coat had found it-which he did in less than ten minutes-he ran
      back to the hats, and Gabriel Parsons pulled up. Then, the gentleman
      without the coat called out 'play,' very loudly, and bowled. Then Mr.
      Gabriel Parsons knocked the ball several yards, and took another run.
      Then, the other gentleman aimed at the wicket, and didn't hit it; and Mr.
      Gabriel Parsons, having finished running on his own account, laid down the
      bat and ran after the ball, which went into a neighbouring field. They
      called this cricket.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tottle, will you "go in?"' inquired Mr. Gabriel Parsons, as he approached
      him, wiping the perspiration off his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle declined the offer, the bare idea of accepting which
      made him even warmer than his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then we'll go into the house, as it's past four, and I shall have to wash
      my hands before dinner,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons. 'Here, I hate ceremony,
      you know! Timson, that's Tottle-Tottle, that's Timson; bred for the
      church, which I fear will never be bread for him;' and he chuckled at the
      old joke. Mr. Timson bowed carelessly. Mr. Watkins Tottle bowed stiffly.
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons led the way to the house. He was a rich sugar-baker,
      who mistook rudeness for honesty, and abrupt bluntness for an open and
      candid manner; many besides Gabriel mistake bluntness for sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gabriel Parsons received the visitors most graciously on the steps,
      and preceded them to the drawing-room. On the sofa, was seated a lady of
      very prim appearance, and remarkably inanimate. She was one of those
      persons at whose age it is impossible to make any reasonable guess; her
      features might have been remarkably pretty when she was younger, and they
      might always have presented the same appearance. Her complexion-with a
      slight trace of powder here and there-was as clear as that of a well-made
      wax doll, and her face as expressive. She was handsomely dressed, and was
      winding up a gold watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Lillerton, my dear, this is our friend Mr. Watkins Tottle; a very
      old acquaintance I assure you,' said Mrs. Parsons, presenting the Strephon
      of Cecil-street, Strand. The lady rose, and made a deep courtesy; Mr.
      Watkins Tottle made a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Splendid, majestic creature!' thought Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Timson advanced, and Mr. Watkins Tottle began to hate him. Men
      generally discover a rival, instinctively, and Mr. Watkins Tottle felt
      that his hate was deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I beg,' said the reverend gentleman,-'May I beg to call upon you,
      Miss Lillerton, for some trifling donation to my soup, coals, and blanket
      distribution society?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Put my name down, for two sovereigns, if you please,' responded Miss
      Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are truly charitable, madam,' said the Reverend Mr. Timson, 'and we
      know that charity will cover a multitude of sins. Let me beg you to
      understand that I do not say this from the supposition that you have many
      sins which require palliation; believe me when I say that I never yet met
      any one who had fewer to atone for, than Miss Lillerton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like a bad imitation of animation lighted up the lady's face, as
      she acknowledged the compliment. Watkins Tottle incurred the sin of
      wishing that the ashes of the Reverend Charles Timson were quietly
      deposited in the churchyard of his curacy, wherever it might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you what,' interrupted Parsons, who had just appeared with
      clean hands, and a black coat, 'it's my private opinion, Timson, that your
      "distribution society" is rather a humbug.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are so severe,' replied Timson, with a Christian smile: he disliked
      Parsons, but liked his dinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So positively unjust!' said Miss Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' observed Tottle. The lady looked up; her eyes met those of
      Mr. Watkins Tottle. She withdrew them in a sweet confusion, and Watkins
      Tottle did the same-the confusion was mutual.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why,' urged Mr. Parsons, pursuing his objections, 'what on earth is the
      use of giving a man coals who has nothing to cook, or giving him blankets
      when he hasn't a bed, or giving him soup when he requires substantial
      food?-"like sending them ruffles when wanting a shirt." Why not give 'em a
      trifle of money, as I do, when I think they deserve it, and let them
      purchase what they think best? Why?-because your subscribers wouldn't see
      their names flourishing in print on the church- door-that's the reason.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really, Mr. Parsons, I hope you don't mean to insinuate that I wish to
      see my name in print, on the church-door,' interrupted Miss Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope not,' said Mr. Watkins Tottle, putting in another word, and
      getting another glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not,' replied Parsons. 'I dare say you wouldn't mind seeing it
      in writing, though, in the church register-eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Register! What register?' inquired the lady gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, the register of marriages, to be sure,' replied Parsons, chuckling
      at the sally, and glancing at Tottle. Mr. Watkins Tottle thought he should
      have fainted for shame, and it is quite impossible to imagine what effect
      the joke would have had upon the lady, if dinner had not been, at that
      moment, announced. Mr. Watkins Tottle, with an unprecedented effort of
      gallantry, offered the tip of his little finger; Miss Lillerton accepted
      it gracefully, with maiden modesty; and they proceeded in due state to the
      dinner-table, where they were soon deposited side by side. The room was
      very snug, the dinner very good, and the little party in spirits. The
      conversation became pretty general, and when Mr. Watkins Tottle had
      extracted one or two cold observations from his neighbour, and had taken
      wine with her, he began to acquire confidence rapidly. The cloth was
      removed; Mrs. Gabriel Parsons drank four glasses of port on the plea of
      being a nurse just then; and Miss Lillerton took about the same number of
      sips, on the plea of not wanting any at all. At length, the ladies
      retired, to the great gratification of Mr. Gabriel Parsons, who had been
      coughing and frowning at his wife, for half-an-hour previously-signals
      which Mrs. Parsons never happened to observe, until she had been pressed
      to take her ordinary quantum, which, to avoid giving trouble, she
      generally did at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you think of her?' inquired Mr. Gabriel Parsons of Mr. Watkins
      Tottle, in an under-tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I dote on her with enthusiasm already!' replied Mr. Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gentlemen, pray let us drink "the ladies,"' said the Reverend Mr. Timson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The ladies!' said Mr. Watkins Tottle, emptying his glass. In the fulness
      of his confidence, he felt as if he could make love to a dozen ladies,
      off-hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, 'I remember when I was a young man-fill
      your glass, Timson.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have this moment emptied it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then fill again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' said Timson, suiting the action to the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I remember,' resumed Mr. Gabriel Parsons, 'when I was a younger man, with
      what a strange compound of feelings I used to drink that toast, and how I
      used to think every woman was an angel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was that before you were married?' mildly inquired Mr. Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! certainly,' replied Mr. Gabriel Parsons. 'I have never thought so
      since; and a precious milksop I must have been, ever to have thought so at
      all. But, you know, I married Fanny under the oddest, and most ridiculous
      circumstances possible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What were they, if one may inquire?' asked Timson, who had heard the
      story, on an average, twice a week for the last six months. Mr. Watkins
      Tottle listened attentively, in the hope of picking up some suggestion
      that might be useful to him in his new undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I spent my wedding-night in a back-kitchen chimney,' said Parsons, by way
      of a beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In a back-kitchen chimney!' ejaculated Watkins Tottle. 'How dreadful!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, it wasn't very pleasant,' replied the small host. 'The fact is,
      Fanny's father and mother liked me well enough as an individual, but had a
      decided objection to my becoming a husband. You see, I hadn't any money in
      those days, and they had; and so they wanted Fanny to pick up somebody
      else. However, we managed to discover the state of each other's affections
      somehow. I used to meet her, at some mutual friends' parties; at first we
      danced together, and talked, and flirted, and all that sort of thing;
      then, I used to like nothing so well as sitting by her side-we didn't talk
      so much then, but I remember I used to have a great notion of looking at
      her out of the extreme corner of my left eye-and then I got very miserable
      and sentimental, and began to write verses, and use Macassar oil. At last
      I couldn't bear it any longer, and after I had walked up and down the
      sunny side of Oxford-street in tight boots for a week-and a devilish hot
      summer it was too-in the hope of meeting her, I sat down and wrote a
      letter, and begged her to manage to see me clandestinely, for I wanted to
      hear her decision from her own mouth. I said I had discovered, to my
      perfect satisfaction, that I couldn't live without her, and that if she
      didn't have me, I had made up my mind to take prussic acid, or take to
      drinking, or emigrate, so as to take myself off in some way or other.
      Well, I borrowed a pound, and bribed the housemaid to give her the note,
      which she did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what was the reply?' inquired Timson, who had found, before, that to
      encourage the repetition of old stories is to get a general invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, the usual one! Fanny expressed herself very miserable; hinted at the
      possibility of an early grave; said that nothing should induce her to
      swerve from the duty she owed her parents; implored me to forget her, and
      find out somebody more deserving, and all that sort of thing. She said she
      could, on no account, think of meeting me unknown to her pa and ma; and
      entreated me, as she should be in a particular part of Kensington Gardens
      at eleven o'clock next morning, not to attempt to meet her there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You didn't go, of course?' said Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Didn't I?-Of course I did. There she was, with the identical housemaid in
      perspective, in order that there might be no interruption. We walked
      about, for a couple of hours; made ourselves delightfully miserable; and
      were regularly engaged. Then, we began to "correspond"-that is to say, we
      used to exchange about four letters a day; what we used to say in 'em I
      can't imagine. And I used to have an interview, in the kitchen, or the
      cellar, or some such place, every evening. Well, things went on in this
      way for some time; and we got fonder of each other every day. At last, as
      our love was raised to such a pitch, and as my salary had been raised too,
      shortly before, we determined on a secret marriage. Fanny arranged to
      sleep at a friend's, on the previous night; we were to be married early in
      the morning; and then we were to return to her home and be pathetic. She
      was to fall at the old gentleman's feet, and bathe his boots with her
      tears; and I was to hug the old lady and call her "mother," and use my
      pocket-handkerchief as much as possible. Married we were, the next
      morning; two girls-friends of Fanny's-acting as bridesmaids; and a man,
      who was hired for five shillings and a pint of porter, officiating as
      father. Now, the old lady unfortunately put off her return from Ramsgate,
      where she had been paying a visit, until the next morning; and as we
      placed great reliance on her, we agreed to postpone our confession for
      four-and-twenty hours. My newly-made wife returned home, and I spent my
      wedding-day in strolling about Hampstead- heath, and execrating my
      father-in-law. Of course, I went to comfort my dear little wife at night,
      as much as I could, with the assurance that our troubles would soon be
      over. I opened the garden-gate, of which I had a key, and was shown by the
      servant to our old place of meeting-a back kitchen, with a stone-floor and
      a dresser: upon which, in the absence of chairs, we used to sit and make
      love.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Make love upon a kitchen-dresser!' interrupted Mr. Watkins Tottle, whose
      ideas of decorum were greatly outraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! On a kitchen-dresser!' replied Parsons. 'And let me tell you, old
      fellow, that, if you were really over head-and-ears in love, and had no
      other place to make love in, you'd be devilish glad to avail yourself of
      such an opportunity. However, let me see;-where was I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the dresser,' suggested Timson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh-ah! Well, here I found poor Fanny, quite disconsolate and
      uncomfortable. The old boy had been very cross all day, which made her
      feel still more lonely; and she was quite out of spirits. So, I put a good
      face on the matter, and laughed it off, and said we should enjoy the
      pleasures of a matrimonial life more by contrast; and, at length, poor
      Fanny brightened up a little. I stopped there, till about eleven o'clock,
      and, just as I was taking my leave for the fourteenth time, the girl came
      running down the stairs, without her shoes, in a great fright, to tell us
      that the old villain-Heaven forgive me for calling him so, for he is dead
      and gone now!-prompted I suppose by the prince of darkness, was coming
      down, to draw his own beer for supper-a thing he had not done before, for
      six months, to my certain knowledge; for the cask stood in that very back
      kitchen. If he discovered me there, explanation would have been out of the
      question; for he was so outrageously violent, when at all excited, that he
      never would have listened to me. There was only one thing to be done. The
      chimney was a very wide one; it had been originally built for an oven;
      went up perpendicularly for a few feet, and then shot backward and formed
      a sort of small cavern. My hopes and fortune-the means of our joint
      existence almost-were at stake. I scrambled in like a squirrel; coiled
      myself up in this recess; and, as Fanny and the girl replaced the deal
      chimney- board, I could see the light of the candle which my unconscious
      father- in-law carried in his hand. I heard him draw the beer; and I never
      heard beer run so slowly. He was just leaving the kitchen, and I was
      preparing to descend, when down came the infernal chimney-board with a
      tremendous crash. He stopped and put down the candle and the jug of beer
      on the dresser; he was a nervous old fellow, and any unexpected noise
      annoyed him. He coolly observed that the fire-place was never used, and
      sending the frightened servant into the next kitchen for a hammer and
      nails, actually nailed up the board, and locked the door on the outside.
      So, there was I, on my wedding-night, in the light kerseymere trousers,
      fancy waistcoat, and blue coat, that I had been married in in the morning,
      in a back-kitchen chimney, the bottom of which was nailed up, and the top
      of which had been formerly raised some fifteen feet, to prevent the smoke
      from annoying the neighbours. And there,' added Mr. Gabriel Parsons, as he
      passed the bottle, 'there I remained till half-past seven the next
      morning, when the housemaid's sweetheart, who was a carpenter, unshelled
      me. The old dog had nailed me up so securely, that, to this very hour, I
      firmly believe that no one but a carpenter could ever have got me out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what did Mrs. Parsons's father say, when he found you were married?'
      inquired Watkins Tottle, who, although he never saw a joke, was not
      satisfied until he heard a story to the very end.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, the affair of the chimney so tickled his fancy, that he pardoned us
      off-hand, and allowed us something to live on till he went the way of all
      flesh. I spent the next night in his second-floor front, much more
      comfortably than I had spent the preceding one; for, as you will probably
      guess-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please, sir, missis has made tea,' said a middle-aged female servant,
      bobbing into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the very housemaid that figures in my story,' said Mr. Gabriel
      Parsons. 'She went into Fanny's service when we were first married, and
      has been with us ever since; but I don't think she has felt one atom of
      respect for me since the morning she saw me released, when she went into
      violent hysterics, to which she has been subject ever since. Now, shall we
      join the ladies?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you please,' said Mr. Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By all means,' added the obsequious Mr. Timson; and the trio made for the
      drawing-room accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea being concluded, and the toast and cups having been duly handed, and
      occasionally upset, by Mr. Watkins Tottle, a rubber was proposed. They cut
      for partners-Mr. and Mrs. Parsons; and Mr. Watkins Tottle and Miss
      Lillerton. Mr. Timson having conscientious scruples on the subject of
      card-playing, drank brandy-and-water, and kept up a running spar with Mr.
      Watkins Tottle. The evening went off well; Mr. Watkins Tottle was in high
      spirits, having some reason to be gratified with his reception by Miss
      Lillerton; and before he left, a small party was made up to visit the
      Beulah Spa on the following Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's all right, I think,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons to Mr. Watkins Tottle
      as he opened the garden gate for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope so,' he replied, squeezing his friend's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll be down by the first coach on Saturday,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' replied Mr. Watkins Tottle. 'Undoubtedly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But fortune had decreed that Mr. Watkins Tottle should not be down by the
      first coach on Saturday. His adventures on that day, however, and the
      success of his wooing, are subjects for another chapter.

      CHAPTER THE SECOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      'The first coach has not come in yet, has it, Tom?' inquired Mr. Gabriel
      Parsons, as he very complacently paced up and down the fourteen feet of
      gravel which bordered the 'lawn,' on the Saturday morning which had been
      fixed upon for the Beulah Spa jaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir; I haven't seen it,' replied a gardener in a blue apron, who let
      himself out to do the ornamental for half-a-crown a day and his 'keep.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Time Tottle was down,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, ruminating-'Oh, here he
      is, no doubt,' added Gabriel, as a cab drove rapidly up the hill; and he
      buttoned his dressing-gown, and opened the gate to receive the expected
      visitor. The cab stopped, and out jumped a man in a coarse Petersham
      great-coat, whity-brown neckerchief, faded black suit, gamboge-coloured
      top-boots, and one of those large-crowned hats, formerly seldom met with,
      but now very generally patronised by gentlemen and costermongers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Parsons?' said the man, looking at the superscription of a note he
      held in his hand, and addressing Gabriel with an inquiring air.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My name is Parsons,' responded the sugar-baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've brought this here note,' replied the individual in the painted tops,
      in a hoarse whisper: 'I've brought this here note from a gen'lm'n as come
      to our house this mornin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I expected the gentleman at my house,' said Parsons, as he broke the
      seal, which bore the impression of her Majesty's profile as it is seen on
      a sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've no doubt the gen'lm'n would ha' been here, replied the stranger, 'if
      he hadn't happened to call at our house first; but we never trusts no
      gen'lm'n furder nor we can see him-no mistake about that there'-added the
      unknown, with a facetious grin; 'beg your pardon, sir, no offence meant,
      only-once in, and I wish you may-catch the idea, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons was not remarkable for catching anything suddenly, but
      a cold. He therefore only bestowed a glance of profound astonishment on
      his mysterious companion, and proceeded to unfold the note of which he had
      been the bearer. Once opened and the idea was caught with very little
      difficulty. Mr. Watkins Tottle had been suddenly arrested for 33l. 10s.
      4d., and dated his communication from a lock-up house in the vicinity of
      Chancery-lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unfortunate affair this!' said Parsons, refolding the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! nothin' ven you're used to it,' coolly observed the man in the
      Petersham.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tom!' exclaimed Parsons, after a few minutes' consideration, 'just put
      the horse in, will you?-Tell the gentleman that I shall be there almost as
      soon as you are,' he continued, addressing the sheriff-officer's Mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Werry well,' replied that important functionary; adding, in a
      confidential manner, 'I'd adwise the gen'lm'n's friends to settle. You see
      it's a mere trifle; and, unless the gen'lm'n means to go up afore the
      court, it's hardly worth while waiting for detainers, you know. Our
      governor's wide awake, he is. I'll never say nothin' agin him, nor no man;
      but he knows what's o'clock, he does, uncommon.' Having delivered this
      eloquent, and, to Parsons, particularly intelligible harangue, the meaning
      of which was eked out by divers nods and winks, the gentleman in the boots
      reseated himself in the cab, which went rapidly off, and was soon out of
      sight. Mr. Gabriel Parsons continued to pace up and down the pathway for
      some minutes, apparently absorbed in deep meditation. The result of his
      cogitations seemed to be perfectly satisfactory to himself, for he ran
      briskly into the house; said that business had suddenly summoned him to
      town; that he had desired the messenger to inform Mr. Watkins Tottle of
      the fact; and that they would return together to dinner. He then hastily
      equipped himself for a drive, and mounting his gig, was soon on his way to
      the establishment of Mr. Solomon Jacobs, situate (as Mr. Watkins Tottle
      had informed him) in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man is in a violent hurry to get on, and has a specific object in
      view, the attainment of which depends on the completion of his journey,
      the difficulties which interpose themselves in his way appear not only to
      be innumerable, but to have been called into existence especially for the
      occasion. The remark is by no means a new one, and Mr. Gabriel Parsons had
      practical and painful experience of its justice in the course of his
      drive. There are three classes of animated objects which prevent your
      driving with any degree of comfort or celerity through streets which are
      but little frequented-they are pigs, children, and old women. On the
      occasion we are describing, the pigs were luxuriating on cabbage-stalks,
      and the shuttlecocks fluttered from the little deal battledores, and the
      children played in the road; and women, with a basket in one hand, and the
      street-door key in the other, would cross just before the horse's head,
      until Mr. Gabriel Parsons was perfectly savage with vexation, and quite
      hoarse with hoi-ing and imprecating. Then, when he got into Fleet-street,
      there was 'a stoppage,' in which people in vehicles have the satisfaction
      of remaining stationary for half an hour, and envying the slowest
      pedestrians; and where policemen rush about, and seize hold of horses'
      bridles, and back them into shop- windows, by way of clearing the road and
      preventing confusion. At length Mr. Gabriel Parsons turned into
      Chancery-lane, and having inquired for, and been directed to
      Cursitor-street (for it was a locality of which he was quite ignorant), he
      soon found himself opposite the house of Mr. Solomon Jacobs. Confiding his
      horse and gig to the care of one of the fourteen boys who had followed him
      from the other side of Blackfriars-bridge on the chance of his requiring
      their services, Mr. Gabriel Parsons crossed the road and knocked at an
      inner door, the upper part of which was of glass, grated like the windows
      of this inviting mansion with iron bars-painted white to look comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knock was answered by a sallow-faced, red-haired, sulky boy, who,
      after surveying Mr. Gabriel Parsons through the glass, applied a large key
      to an immense wooden excrescence, which was in reality a lock, but which,
      taken in conjunction with the iron nails with which the panels were
      studded, gave the door the appearance of being subject to warts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to see Mr. Watkins Tottle,' said Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the gentleman that come in this morning, Jem,' screamed a voice from
      the top of the kitchen-stairs, which belonged to a dirty woman who had
      just brought her chin to a level with the passage-floor. 'The gentleman's
      in the coffee-room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Up-stairs, sir,' said the boy, just opening the door wide enough to let
      Parsons in without squeezing him, and double-locking it the moment he had
      made his way through the aperture-'First floor-door on the left.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons thus instructed, ascended the uncarpeted and ill-
      lighted staircase, and after giving several subdued taps at the before-
      mentioned 'door on the left,' which were rendered inaudible by the hum of
      voices within the room, and the hissing noise attendant on some frying
      operations which were carrying on below stairs, turned the handle, and
      entered the apartment. Being informed that the unfortunate object of his
      visit had just gone up-stairs to write a letter, he had leisure to sit
      down and observe the scene before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room-which was a small, confined den-was partitioned off into boxes,
      like the common-room of some inferior eating-house. The dirty floor had
      evidently been as long a stranger to the scrubbing-brush as to carpet or
      floor-cloth: and the ceiling was completely blackened by the flare of the
      oil-lamp by which the room was lighted at night. The gray ashes on the
      edges of the tables, and the cigar ends which were plentifully scattered
      about the dusty grate, fully accounted for the intolerable smell of
      tobacco which pervaded the place; and the empty glasses and half-saturated
      slices of lemon on the tables, together with the porter pots beneath them,
      bore testimony to the frequent libations in which the individuals who
      honoured Mr. Solomon Jacobs by a temporary residence in his house
      indulged. Over the mantel-shelf was a paltry looking-glass, extending
      about half the width of the chimney-piece; but by way of counterpoise, the
      ashes were confined by a rusty fender about twice as long as the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this cheerful room itself, the attention of Mr. Gabriel Parsons was
      naturally directed to its inmates. In one of the boxes two men were
      playing at cribbage with a very dirty pack of cards, some with blue, some
      with green, and some with red backs-selections from decayed packs. The
      cribbage board had been long ago formed on the table by some ingenious
      visitor with the assistance of a pocket-knife and a two- pronged fork,
      with which the necessary number of holes had been made in the table at
      proper distances for the reception of the wooden pegs. In another box a
      stout, hearty-looking man, of about forty, was eating some dinner which
      his wife-an equally comfortable-looking personage-had brought him in a
      basket: and in a third, a genteel-looking young man was talking earnestly,
      and in a low tone, to a young female, whose face was concealed by a thick
      veil, but whom Mr. Gabriel Parsons immediately set down in his own mind as
      the debtor's wife. A young fellow of vulgar manners, dressed in the very
      extreme of the prevailing fashion, was pacing up and down the room, with a
      lighted cigar in his mouth and his hands in his pockets, ever and anon
      puffing forth volumes of smoke, and occasionally applying, with much
      apparent relish, to a pint pot, the contents of which were 'chilling' on
      the hob.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fourpence more, by gum!' exclaimed one of the cribbage-players, lighting
      a pipe, and addressing his adversary at the close of the game; 'one 'ud
      think you'd got luck in a pepper-cruet, and shook it out when you wanted
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that a'n't a bad un,' replied the other, who was a horse-dealer
      from Islington.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; I'm blessed if it is,' interposed the jolly-looking fellow, who,
      having finished his dinner, was drinking out of the same glass as his
      wife, in truly conjugal harmony, some hot gin-and-water. The faithful
      partner of his cares had brought a plentiful supply of the anti-
      temperance fluid in a large flat stone bottle, which looked like a half-
      gallon jar that had been successfully tapped for the dropsy. 'You're a rum
      chap, you are, Mr. Walker-will you dip your beak into this, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank'ee, sir,' replied Mr. Walker, leaving his box, and advancing to the
      other to accept the proffered glass. 'Here's your health, sir, and your
      good 'ooman's here. Gentlemen all-yours, and better luck still. Well, Mr.
      Willis,' continued the facetious prisoner, addressing the young man with
      the cigar, 'you seem rather down to-day-floored, as one may say. What's
      the matter, sir? Never say die, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! I'm all right,' replied the smoker. 'I shall be bailed out to-
      morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall you, though?' inquired the other. 'Damme, I wish I could say the
      same. I am as regularly over head and ears as the Royal George, and stand
      about as much chance of being bailed out. Ha! ha! ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why,' said the young man, stopping short, and speaking in a very loud
      key, 'look at me. What d'ye think I've stopped here two days for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Cause you couldn't get out, I suppose,' interrupted Mr. Walker, winking
      to the company. 'Not that you're exactly obliged to stop here, only you
      can't help it. No compulsion, you know, only you must-eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A'n't he a rum un?' inquired the delighted individual, who had offered
      the gin-and-water, of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, he just is!' replied the lady, who was quite overcome by these
      flashes of imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, my case,' frowned the victim, throwing the end of his cigar into the
      fire, and illustrating his argument by knocking the bottom of the pot on
      the table, at intervals,-'my case is a very singular one. My father's a
      man of large property, and I am his son.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's a very strange circumstance!' interrupted the jocose Mr. Walker,
      en passant.
    </p>
    <p>
      '-I am his son, and have received a liberal education. I don't owe no man
      nothing-not the value of a farthing, but I was induced, you see, to put my
      name to some bills for a friend-bills to a large amount, I may say a very
      large amount, for which I didn't receive no consideration. What's the
      consequence?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I suppose the bills went out, and you came in. The acceptances
      weren't taken up, and you were, eh?' inquired Walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure,' replied the liberally educated young gentleman. 'To be sure;
      and so here I am, locked up for a matter of twelve hundred pound.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why don't you ask your old governor to stump up?' inquired Walker, with a
      somewhat sceptical air.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! bless you, he'd never do it,' replied the other, in a tone of
      expostulation-'Never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it is very odd to-be-sure,' interposed the owner of the flat
      bottle, mixing another glass, 'but I've been in difficulties, as one may
      say, now for thirty year. I went to pieces when I was in a milk-walk,
      thirty year ago; arterwards, when I was a fruiterer, and kept a spring
      wan; and arter that again in the coal and 'tatur line-but all that time I
      never see a youngish chap come into a place of this kind, who wasn't going
      out again directly, and who hadn't been arrested on bills which he'd given
      a friend and for which he'd received nothing whatsomever-not a fraction.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! it's always the cry,' said Walker. 'I can't see the use on it; that's
      what makes me so wild. Why, I should have a much better opinion of an
      individual, if he'd say at once in an honourable and gentlemanly manner as
      he'd done everybody he possibly could.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, to be sure,' interposed the horse-dealer, with whose notions of
      bargain and sale the axiom perfectly coincided, 'so should I.' The young
      gentleman, who had given rise to these observations, was on the point of
      offering a rather angry reply to these sneers, but the rising of the young
      man before noticed, and of the female who had been sitting by him, to
      leave the room, interrupted the conversation. She had been weeping
      bitterly, and the noxious atmosphere of the room acting upon her excited
      feelings and delicate frame, rendered the support of her companion
      necessary as they quitted it together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an air of superiority about them both, and something in their
      appearance so unusual in such a place, that a respectful silence was
      observed until the whirr-r-bang of the spring door announced that they
      were out of hearing. It was broken by the wife of the ex-fruiterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor creetur!' said she, quenching a sigh in a rivulet of gin-and- water.
      'She's very young.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's a nice-looking 'ooman too,' added the horse-dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's he in for, Ikey?' inquired Walker, of an individual who was
      spreading a cloth with numerous blotches of mustard upon it, on one of the
      tables, and whom Mr. Gabriel Parsons had no difficulty in recognising as
      the man who had called upon him in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Vy,' responded the factotum, 'it's one of the rummiest rigs you ever
      heard on. He come in here last Vensday, which by-the-bye he's a-going over
      the water to-night-hows'ever that's neither here nor there. You see I've
      been a going back'ards and for'ards about his business, and ha' managed to
      pick up some of his story from the servants and them; and so far as I can
      make it out, it seems to be summat to this here effect-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cut it short, old fellow,' interrupted Walker, who knew from former
      experience that he of the top-boots was neither very concise nor
      intelligible in his narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me alone,' replied Ikey, 'and I'll ha' wound up, and made my lucky in
      five seconds. This here young gen'lm'n's father-so I'm told, mind ye-and
      the father o' the young voman, have always been on very bad, out- and-out,
      rig'lar knock-me-down sort o' terms; but somehow or another, when he was a
      wisitin' at some gentlefolk's house, as he knowed at college, he came into
      contract with the young lady. He seed her several times, and then he up
      and said he'd keep company with her, if so be as she vos agreeable. Vell,
      she vos as sweet upon him as he vos upon her, and so I s'pose they made it
      all right; for they got married 'bout six months arterwards, unbeknown,
      mind ye, to the two fathers-leastways so I'm told. When they heard on
      it-my eyes, there was such a combustion! Starvation vos the very least
      that vos to be done to 'em. The young gen'lm'n's father cut him off vith a
      bob, 'cos he'd cut himself off vith a wife; and the young lady's father he
      behaved even worser and more unnat'ral, for he not only blow'd her up
      dreadful, and swore he'd never see her again, but he employed a chap as I
      knows-and as you knows, Mr. Valker, a precious sight too well-to go about
      and buy up the bills and them things on which the young husband, thinking
      his governor 'ud come round agin, had raised the vind just to blow himself
      on vith for a time; besides vich, he made all the interest he could to set
      other people agin him. Consequence vos, that he paid as long as he could;
      but things he never expected to have to meet till he'd had time to turn
      himself round, come fast upon him, and he vos nabbed. He vos brought here,
      as I said afore, last Vensday, and I think there's about-ah, half-a-dozen
      detainers agin him down-stairs now. I have been,' added Ikey, 'in the
      purfession these fifteen year, and I never met vith such windictiveness
      afore!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor creeturs!' exclaimed the coal-dealer's wife once more: again
      resorting to the same excellent prescription for nipping a sigh in the
      bud. 'Ah! when they've seen as much trouble as I and my old man here have,
      they'll be as comfortable under it as we are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The young lady's a pretty creature,' said Walker, 'only she's a little
      too delicate for my taste-there ain't enough of her. As to the young cove,
      he may be very respectable and what not, but he's too down in the mouth
      for me-he ain't game.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Game!' exclaimed Ikey, who had been altering the position of a green-
      handled knife and fork at least a dozen times, in order that he might
      remain in the room under the pretext of having something to do. 'He's game
      enough ven there's anything to be fierce about; but who could be game as
      you call it, Mr. Walker, with a pale young creetur like that, hanging
      about him?-It's enough to drive any man's heart into his boots to see 'em
      together-and no mistake at all about it. I never shall forget her first
      comin' here; he wrote to her on the Thursday to come-I know he did, 'cos I
      took the letter. Uncommon fidgety he was all day to be sure, and in the
      evening he goes down into the office, and he says to Jacobs, says he,
      "Sir, can I have the loan of a private room for a few minutes this
      evening, without incurring any additional expense-just to see my wife in?"
      says he. Jacobs looked as much as to say-"Strike me bountiful if you ain't
      one of the modest sort!" but as the gen'lm'n who had been in the back
      parlour had just gone out, and had paid for it for that day, he says-werry
      grave-"Sir," says he, "it's agin our rules to let private rooms to our
      lodgers on gratis terms, but," says he, "for a gentleman, I don't mind
      breaking through them for once." So then he turns round to me, and says,
      "Ikey, put two mould candles in the back parlour, and charge 'em to this
      gen'lm'n's account," vich I did. Vell, by-and-by a hackney-coach comes up
      to the door, and there, sure enough, was the young lady, wrapped up in a
      hopera-cloak, as it might be, and all alone. I opened the gate that night,
      so I went up when the coach come, and he vos a waitin' at the parlour
      door-and wasn't he a trembling, neither? The poor creetur see him, and
      could hardly walk to meet him. "Oh, Harry!" she says, "that it should have
      come to this; and all for my sake," says she, putting her hand upon his
      shoulder. So he puts his arm round her pretty little waist, and leading
      her gently a little way into the room, so that he might be able to shut
      the door, he says, so kind and soft-like-"Why, Kate," says he-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's the gentleman you want,' said Ikey, abruptly breaking off in his
      story, and introducing Mr. Gabriel Parsons to the crest-fallen Watkins
      Tottle, who at that moment entered the room. Watkins advanced with a
      wooden expression of passive endurance, and accepted the hand which Mr.
      Gabriel Parsons held out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to speak to you,' said Gabriel, with a look strongly expressive of
      his dislike of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This way,' replied the imprisoned one, leading the way to the front
      drawing-room, where rich debtors did the luxurious at the rate of a couple
      of guineas a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, here I am,' said Mr. Watkins, as he sat down on the sofa; and
      placing the palms of his hands on his knees, anxiously glanced at his
      friend's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and here you're likely to be,' said Gabriel, coolly, as he rattled
      the money in his unmentionable pockets, and looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the amount with the costs?' inquired Parsons, after an awkward
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you any money?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nine and sixpence halfpenny.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons walked up and down the room for a few seconds, before
      he could make up his mind to disclose the plan he had formed; he was
      accustomed to drive hard bargains, but was always most anxious to conceal
      his avarice. At length he stopped short, and said, 'Tottle, you owe me
      fifty pounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And from all I see, I infer that you are likely to owe it to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fear I am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Though you have every disposition to pay me if you could?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, 'listen: here's my proposition. You know
      my way of old. Accept it-yes or no-I will or I won't. I'll pay the debt
      and costs, and I'll lend you 10l. more (which, added to your annuity, will
      enable you to carry on the war well) if you'll give me your note of hand
      to pay me one hundred and fifty pounds within six months after you are
      married to Miss Lillerton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop a minute-on one condition; and that is, that you propose to Miss
      Lillerton at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At once! My dear Parsons, consider.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's for you to consider, not me. She knows you well from reputation,
      though she did not know you personally until lately. Notwithstanding all
      her maiden modesty, I think she'd be devilish glad to get married out of
      hand with as little delay as possible. My wife has sounded her on the
      subject, and she has confessed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-what?' eagerly interrupted the enamoured Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why,' replied Parsons, 'to say exactly what she has confessed, would be
      rather difficult, because they only spoke in hints, and so forth; but my
      wife, who is no bad judge in these cases, declared to me that what she had
      confessed was as good as to say that she was not insensible of your
      merits-in fact, that no other man should have her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle rose hastily from his seat, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that for?' inquired Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to send the man for the bill stamp,' replied Mr. Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you've made up your mind?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have,'-and they shook hands most cordially. The note of hand was
      given-the debt and costs were paid-Ikey was satisfied for his trouble, and
      the two friends soon found themselves on that side of Mr. Solomon Jacobs's
      establishment, on which most of his visitors were very happy when they
      found themselves once again-to wit, the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, as they drove to Norwood together-'you
      shall have an opportunity to make the disclosure to-night, and mind you
      speak out, Tottle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will-I will!' replied Watkins, valorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How I should like to see you together,' ejaculated Mr. Gabriel
      Parsons.-'What fun!' and he laughed so long and so loudly, that he
      disconcerted Mr. Watkins Tottle, and frightened the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's Fanny and your intended walking about on the lawn,' said Gabriel,
      as they approached the house. 'Mind your eye, Tottle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never fear,' replied Watkins, resolutely, as he made his way to the spot
      where the ladies were walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's Mr. Tottle, my dear,' said Mrs. Parsons, addressing Miss
      Lillerton. The lady turned quickly round, and acknowledged his courteous
      salute with the same sort of confusion that Watkins had noticed on their
      first interview, but with something like a slight expression of
      disappointment or carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you see how glad she was to see you?' whispered Parsons to his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I really thought she looked as if she would rather have seen
      somebody else,' replied Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pooh, nonsense!' whispered Parsons again-'it's always the way with the
      women, young or old. They never show how delighted they are to see those
      whose presence makes their hearts beat. It's the way with the whole sex,
      and no man should have lived to your time of life without knowing it.
      Fanny confessed it to me, when we were first married, over and over
      again-see what it is to have a wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' whispered Tottle, whose courage was vanishing fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, now, you'd better begin to pave the way,' said Parsons, who, having
      invested some money in the speculation, assumed the office of director.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, I will-presently,' replied Tottle, greatly flurried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say something to her, man,' urged Parsons again. 'Confound it! pay her a
      compliment, can't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! not till after dinner,' replied the bashful Tottle, anxious to
      postpone the evil moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, gentlemen,' said Mrs. Parsons, 'you are really very polite; you
      stay away the whole morning, after promising to take us out, and when you
      do come home, you stand whispering together and take no notice of us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We were talking of the business, my dear, which detained us this
      morning,' replied Parsons, looking significantly at Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me! how very quickly the morning has gone,' said Miss Lillerton,
      referring to the gold watch, which was wound up on state occasions,
      whether it required it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it has passed very slowly,' mildly suggested Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ('That's right-bravo!') whispered Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed!' said Miss Lillerton, with an air of majestic surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can only impute it to my unavoidable absence from your society, madam,'
      said Watkins, 'and that of Mrs. Parsons.'
    </p>
    <p>
      During this short dialogue, the ladies had been leading the way to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What the deuce did you stick Fanny into that last compliment for?'
      inquired Parsons, as they followed together; 'it quite spoilt the effect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! it really would have been too broad without,' replied Watkins Tottle,
      'much too broad!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's mad!' Parsons whispered his wife, as they entered the drawing- room,
      'mad from modesty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me!' ejaculated the lady, 'I never heard of such a thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll find we have quite a family dinner, Mr. Tottle,' said Mrs.
      Parsons, when they sat down to table: 'Miss Lillerton is one of us, and,
      of course, we make no stranger of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle expressed a hope that the Parsons family never would
      make a stranger of him; and wished internally that his bashfulness would
      allow him to feel a little less like a stranger himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take off the covers, Martha,' said Mrs. Parsons, directing the shifting
      of the scenery with great anxiety. The order was obeyed, and a pair of
      boiled fowls, with tongue and et ceteras, were displayed at the top, and a
      fillet of veal at the bottom. On one side of the table two green
      sauce-tureens, with ladles of the same, were setting to each other in a
      green dish; and on the other was a curried rabbit, in a brown suit, turned
      up with lemon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Lillerton, my dear,' said Mrs. Parsons, 'shall I assist you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, no; I think I'll trouble Mr. Tottle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Watkins started-trembled-helped the rabbit-and broke a tumbler. The
      countenance of the lady of the house, which had been all smiles
      previously, underwent an awful change.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Extremely sorry,' stammered Watkins, assisting himself to currie and
      parsley and butter, in the extremity of his confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not the least consequence,' replied Mrs. Parsons, in a tone which implied
      that it was of the greatest consequence possible,-directing aside the
      researches of the boy, who was groping under the table for the bits of
      broken glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I presume,' said Miss Lillerton, 'that Mr. Tottle is aware of the
      interest which bachelors usually pay in such cases; a dozen glasses for
      one is the lowest penalty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons gave his friend an admonitory tread on the toe. Here
      was a clear hint that the sooner he ceased to be a bachelor and
      emancipated himself from such penalties, the better. Mr. Watkins Tottle
      viewed the observation in the same light, and challenged Mrs. Parsons to
      take wine, with a degree of presence of mind, which, under all the
      circumstances, was really extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Lillerton,' said Gabriel, 'may I have the pleasure?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be most happy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tottle, will you assist Miss Lillerton, and pass the decanter. Thank
      you.' (The usual pantomimic ceremony of nodding and sipping gone through)-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tottle, were you ever in Suffolk?' inquired the master of the house, who
      was burning to tell one of his seven stock stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' responded Watkins, adding, by way of a saving clause, 'but I've been
      in Devonshire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' replied Gabriel, 'it was in Suffolk that a rather singular
      circumstance happened to me many years ago. Did you ever happen to hear me
      mention it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle had happened to hear his friend mention it some four
      hundred times. Of course he expressed great curiosity, and evinced the
      utmost impatience to hear the story again. Mr. Gabriel Parsons forthwith
      attempted to proceed, in spite of the interruptions to which, as our
      readers must frequently have observed, the master of the house is often
      exposed in such cases. We will attempt to give them an idea of our
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When I was in Suffolk-' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take off the fowls first, Martha,' said Mrs. Parsons. 'I beg your pardon,
      my dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When I was in Suffolk,' resumed Mr. Parsons, with an impatient glance at
      his wife, who pretended not to observe it, 'which is now years ago,
      business led me to the town of Bury St. Edmund's. I had to stop at the
      principal places in my way, and therefore, for the sake of convenience, I
      travelled in a gig. I left Sudbury one dark night-it was winter time-about
      nine o'clock; the rain poured in torrents, the wind howled among the trees
      that skirted the roadside, and I was obliged to proceed at a foot-pace,
      for I could hardly see my hand before me, it was so dark-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'John,' interrupted Mrs. Parsons, in a low, hollow voice, 'don't spill
      that gravy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fanny,' said Parsons impatiently, 'I wish you'd defer these domestic
      reproofs to some more suitable time. Really, my dear, these constant
      interruptions are very annoying.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, I didn't interrupt you,' said Mrs. Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dear, you did interrupt me,' remonstrated Mr. Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How very absurd you are, my love! I must give directions to the servants;
      I am quite sure that if I sat here and allowed John to spill the gravy
      over the new carpet, you'd be the first to find fault when you saw the
      stain to-morrow morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' continued Gabriel with a resigned air, as if he knew there was no
      getting over the point about the carpet, 'I was just saying, it was so
      dark that I could hardly see my hand before me. The road was very lonely,
      and I assure you, Tottle (this was a device to arrest the wandering
      attention of that individual, which was distracted by a confidential
      communication between Mrs. Parsons and Martha, accompanied by the delivery
      of a large bunch of keys), I assure you, Tottle, I became somehow
      impressed with a sense of the loneliness of my situation-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pie to your master,' interrupted Mrs. Parsons, again directing the
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, pray, my dear,' remonstrated Parsons once more, very pettishly. Mrs.
      P. turned up her hands and eyebrows, and appealed in dumb show to Miss
      Lillerton. 'As I turned a corner of the road,' resumed Gabriel, 'the horse
      stopped short, and reared tremendously. I pulled up, jumped out, ran to
      his head, and found a man lying on his back in the middle of the road,
      with his eyes fixed on the sky. I thought he was dead; but no, he was
      alive, and there appeared to be nothing the matter with him. He jumped up,
      and putting his hand to his chest, and fixing upon me the most earnest
      gaze you can imagine, exclaimed-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pudding here,' said Mrs. Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! it's no use,' exclaimed the host, now rendered desperate. 'Here,
      Tottle; a glass of wine. It's useless to attempt relating anything when
      Mrs. Parsons is present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This attack was received in the usual way. Mrs. Parsons talked to Miss
      Lillerton and at her better half; expatiated on the impatience of men
      generally; hinted that her husband was peculiarly vicious in this respect,
      and wound up by insinuating that she must be one of the best tempers that
      ever existed, or she never could put up with it. Really what she had to
      endure sometimes, was more than any one who saw her in every-day life
      could by possibility suppose.-The story was now a painful subject, and
      therefore Mr. Parsons declined to enter into any details, and contented
      himself by stating that the man was a maniac, who had escaped from a
      neighbouring mad-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloth was removed; the ladies soon afterwards retired, and Miss
      Lillerton played the piano in the drawing-room overhead, very loudly, for
      the edification of the visitor. Mr. Watkins Tottle and Mr. Gabriel Parsons
      sat chatting comfortably enough, until the conclusion of the second
      bottle, when the latter, in proposing an adjournment to the drawing-room,
      informed Watkins that he had concerted a plan with his wife, for leaving
      him and Miss Lillerton alone, soon after tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say,' said Tottle, as they went up-stairs, 'don't you think it would be
      better if we put it off till-till-to-morrow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you think it would have been much better if I had left you in that
      wretched hole I found you in this morning?' retorted Parsons bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-well-I only made a suggestion,' said poor Watkins Tottle, with a
      deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea was soon concluded, and Miss Lillerton, drawing a small work-table on
      one side of the fire, and placing a little wooden frame upon it, something
      like a miniature clay-mill without the horse, was soon busily engaged in
      making a watch-guard with brown silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'God bless me!' exclaimed Parsons, starting up with well-feigned surprise,
      'I've forgotten those confounded letters. Tottle, I know you'll excuse
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      If Tottle had been a free agent, he would have allowed no one to leave the
      room on any pretence, except himself. As it was, however, he was obliged
      to look cheerful when Parsons quitted the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely left, when Martha put her head into the room,
      with-'Please, ma'am, you're wanted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Parsons left the room, shut the door carefully after her, and Mr.
      Watkins Tottle was left alone with Miss Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first five minutes there was a dead silence.-Mr. Watkins Tottle
      was thinking how he should begin, and Miss Lillerton appeared to be
      thinking of nothing. The fire was burning low; Mr. Watkins Tottle stirred
      it, and put some coals on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hem!' coughed Miss Lillerton; Mr. Watkins Tottle thought the fair
      creature had spoken. 'I beg your pardon,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought you spoke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There are some books on the sofa, Mr. Tottle, if you would like to look
      at them,' said Miss Lillerton, after the lapse of another five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you,' returned Watkins; and then he added, with a courage which
      was perfectly astonishing, even to himself, 'Madam, that is Miss
      Lillerton, I wish to speak to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To me!' said Miss Lillerton, letting the silk drop from her hands, and
      sliding her chair back a few paces.-'Speak-to me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To you, madam-and on the subject of the state of your affections.' The
      lady hastily rose and would have left the room; but Mr. Watkins Tottle
      gently detained her by the hand, and holding it as far from him as the
      joint length of their arms would permit, he thus proceeded: 'Pray do not
      misunderstand me, or suppose that I am led to address you, after so short
      an acquaintance, by any feeling of my own merits-for merits I have none
      which could give me a claim to your hand. I hope you will acquit me of any
      presumption when I explain that I have been acquainted through Mrs.
      Parsons, with the state-that is, that Mrs. Parsons has told me-at least,
      not Mrs. Parsons, but-' here Watkins began to wander, but Miss Lillerton
      relieved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Am I to understand, Mr. Tottle, that Mrs. Parsons has acquainted you with
      my feeling-my affection-I mean my respect, for an individual of the
      opposite sex?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, what?' inquired Miss Lillerton, averting her face, with a girlish
      air, 'what could induce you to seek such an interview as this? What can
      your object be? How can I promote your happiness, Mr. Tottle?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the time for a flourish-'By allowing me,' replied Watkins,
      falling bump on his knees, and breaking two brace-buttons and a
      waistcoat-string, in the act-'By allowing me to be your slave, your
      servant-in short, by unreservedly making me the confidant of your heart's
      feelings-may I say for the promotion of your own happiness-may I say, in
      order that you may become the wife of a kind and affectionate husband?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Disinterested creature!' exclaimed Miss Lillerton, hiding her face in a
      white pocket-handkerchief with an eyelet-hole border.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle thought that if the lady knew all, she might possibly
      alter her opinion on this last point. He raised the tip of her middle
      finger ceremoniously to his lips, and got off his knees, as gracefully as
      he could. 'My information was correct?' he tremulously inquired, when he
      was once more on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was.' Watkins elevated his hands, and looked up to the ornament in the
      centre of the ceiling, which had been made for a lamp, by way of
      expressing his rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our situation, Mr. Tottle,' resumed the lady, glancing at him through one
      of the eyelet-holes, 'is a most peculiar and delicate one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is,' said Mr. Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our acquaintance has been of so short duration,' said Miss Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only a week,' assented Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! more than that,' exclaimed the lady, in a tone of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed!' said Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'More than a month-more than two months!' said Miss Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather odd, this,' thought Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' he said, recollecting Parsons's assurance that she had known him
      from report, 'I understand. But, my dear madam, pray, consider. The longer
      this acquaintance has existed, the less reason is there for delay now. Why
      not at once fix a period for gratifying the hopes of your devoted
      admirer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has been represented to me again and again that this is the course I
      ought to pursue,' replied Miss Lillerton, 'but pardon my feelings of
      delicacy, Mr. Tottle-pray excuse this embarrassment-I have peculiar ideas
      on such subjects, and I am quite sure that I never could summon up
      fortitude enough to name the day to my future husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then allow me to name it,' said Tottle eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to fix it myself,' replied Miss Lillerton, bashfully, 'but
      I cannot do so without at once resorting to a third party.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A third party!' thought Watkins Tottle; 'who the deuce is that to be, I
      wonder!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Tottle,' continued Miss Lillerton, 'you have made me a most
      disinterested and kind offer-that offer I accept. Will you at once be the
      bearer of a note from me to-to Mr. Timson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Timson!' said Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'After what has passed between us,' responded Miss Lillerton, still
      averting her head, 'you must understand whom I mean; Mr. Timson,
      the-the-clergyman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Timson, the clergyman!' ejaculated Watkins Tottle, in a state of
      inexpressible beatitude, and positive wonder at his own success. 'Angel!
      Certainly-this moment!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll prepare it immediately,' said Miss Lillerton, making for the door;
      'the events of this day have flurried me so much, Mr. Tottle, that I shall
      not leave my room again this evening; I will send you the note by the
      servant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stay,-stay,' cried Watkins Tottle, still keeping a most respectful
      distance from the lady; 'when shall we meet again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! Mr. Tottle,' replied Miss Lillerton, coquettishly, 'when we are
      married, I can never see you too often, nor thank you too much;' and she
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle flung himself into an arm-chair, and indulged in the
      most delicious reveries of future bliss, in which the idea of 'Five
      hundred pounds per annum, with an uncontrolled power of disposing of it by
      her last will and testament,' was somehow or other the foremost. He had
      gone through the interview so well, and it had terminated so admirably,
      that he almost began to wish he had expressly stipulated for the
      settlement of the annual five hundred on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I come in?' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, peeping in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may,' replied Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, have you done it?' anxiously inquired Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have I done it!' said Watkins Tottle. 'Hush-I'm going to the clergyman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' said Parsons. 'How well you have managed it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where does Timson live?' inquired Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At his uncle's,' replied Gabriel, 'just round the lane. He's waiting for
      a living, and has been assisting his uncle here for the last two or three
      months. But how well you have done it-I didn't think you could have
      carried it off so!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle was proceeding to demonstrate that the Richardsonian
      principle was the best on which love could possibly be made, when he was
      interrupted by the entrance of Martha, with a little pink note folded like
      a fancy cocked-hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Lillerton's compliments,' said Martha, as she delivered it into
      Tottle's hands, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you observe the delicacy?' said Tottle, appealing to Mr. Gabriel
      Parsons. 'Compliments, not love, by the servant, eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons didn't exactly know what reply to make, so he poked
      the forefinger of his right hand between the third and fourth ribs of Mr.
      Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come,' said Watkins, when the explosion of mirth, consequent on this
      practical jest, had subsided, 'we'll be off at once-let's lose no time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital!' echoed Gabriel Parsons; and in five minutes they were at the
      garden-gate of the villa tenanted by the uncle of Mr. Timson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mr. Charles Timson at home?' inquired Mr. Watkins Tottle of Mr.
      Charles Timson's uncle's man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Charles is at home,' replied the man, stammering; 'but he desired me
      to say he couldn't be interrupted, sir, by any of the parishioners.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not a parishioner,' replied Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mr. Charles writing a sermon, Tom?' inquired Parsons, thrusting
      himself forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Mr. Parsons, sir; he's not exactly writing a sermon, but he is
      practising the violoncello in his own bedroom, and gave strict orders not
      to be disturbed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say I'm here,' replied Gabriel, leading the way across the garden; 'Mr.
      Parsons and Mr. Tottle, on private and particular business.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They were shown into the parlour, and the servant departed to deliver his
      message. The distant groaning of the violoncello ceased; footsteps were
      heard on the stairs; and Mr. Timson presented himself, and shook hands
      with Parsons with the utmost cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Game!' exclaimed Ikey, who had been altering the position of a green-
      handled knife and fork at least a dozen times, in order that he might
      remain in the room under the pretext of having something to do. 'He's game
      enough ven there's anything to be fierce about; but who could be game as
      you call it, Mr. Walker, with a pale young creetur like that, hanging
      about him?-It's enough to drive any man's heart into his boots to see 'em
      together-and no mistake at all about it. I never shall forget her first
      comin' here; he wrote to her on the Thursday to come-I know he did, 'cos I
      took the letter. Uncommon fidgety he was all day to be sure, and in the
      evening he goes down into the office, and he says to Jacobs, says he,
      "Sir, can I have the loan of a private room for a few minutes this
      evening, without incurring any additional expense-just to see my wife in?"
      says he. Jacobs looked as much as to say-"Strike me bountiful if you ain't
      one of the modest sort!" but as the gen'lm'n who had been in the back
      parlour had just gone out, and had paid for it for that day, he says-werry
      grave-"Sir," says he, "it's agin our rules to let private rooms to our
      lodgers on gratis terms, but," says he, "for a gentleman, I don't mind
      breaking through them for once." So then he turns found to me, and says,
      "Ikey, put two mould candles in the back parlour, and charge 'em to this
      gen'lm'n's account," vich I did. Vell, by-and-by a hackney-coach comes up
      to the door, and there, sure enough, was the young lady, wrapped up in a
      hopera-cloak, as it might be, and all alone. I opened the gate that night,
      so I went up when the coach come, and he vos a waitin' at the parlour
      door-and wasn't he a trembling, neither? The poor creetur see him, and
      could hardly walk to meet him. "Oh, Harry!" she says, "that it should have
      come to this; and all for my sake," says she, putting her hand upon his
      shoulder. So he puts his arm round her pretty little waist, and leading
      her gently a little way into the room, so that he might be able to shut
      the door, he says, so kind and soft-like-"Why, Kate," says he-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's the gentleman you want,' said Ikey, abruptly breaking off in his
      story, and introducing Mr. Gabriel Parsons to the crest-fallen Watkins
      Tottle, who at that moment entered the room. Watkins advanced with a
      wooden expression of passive endurance, and accepted the hand which Mr.
      Gabriel Parsons held out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to speak to you,' said Gabriel, with a look strongly expressive of
      his dislike of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This way,' replied the imprisoned one, leading the way to the front
      drawing-room, where rich debtors did the luxurious at the rate of a couple
      of guineas a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, here I am,' said Mr. Watkins, as he sat down on the sofa; and
      placing the palms of his hands on his knees, anxiously glanced at his
      friend's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and here you're likely to be,' said Gabriel, coolly, as he rattled
      the money in his unmentionable pockets, and looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the amount with the costs?' inquired Parsons, after an awkward
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you any money?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nine and sixpence halfpenny.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons walked up and down the room for a few seconds, before
      he could make up his mind to disclose the plan he had formed; he was
      accustomed to drive hard bargains, but was always most anxious to conceal
      his avarice. At length he stopped short, and said, 'Tottle, you owe me
      fifty pounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And from all I see, I infer that you are likely to owe it to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fear I am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Though you have every disposition to pay me if you could?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, 'listen: here's my proposition. You know
      my way of old. Accept it-yes or no-I will or I won't. I'll pay the debt
      and costs, and I'll lend you 10l. more (which, added to your annuity, will
      enable you to carry on the war well) if you'll give me your note of hand
      to pay me one hundred and fifty pounds within six months after you are
      married to Miss Lillerton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop a minute-on one condition; and that is, that you propose to Miss
      Lillerton at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At once! My dear Parsons, consider.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's for you to consider, not me. She knows you well from reputation,
      though she did not know you personally until lately. Notwithstanding all
      her maiden modesty, I think she'd be devilish glad to get married out of
      hand with as little delay as possible. My wife has sounded her on the
      subject, and she has confessed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What-what?' eagerly interrupted the enamoured Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why,' replied Parsons, 'to say exactly what she has confessed, would be
      rather difficult, because they only spoke in hints, and so forth; but my
      wife, who is no bad judge in these cases, declared to me that what she had
      confessed was as good as to say that she was not insensible of your
      merits-in fact, that no other man should have her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle rose hastily from his seat, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that for?' inquired Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to send the man for the bill stamp,' replied Mr. Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you've made up your mind?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have,'-and they shook hands most cordially. The note of hand was
      given-the debt and costs were paid-Ikey was satisfied for his trouble, and
      the two friends soon found themselves on that side of Mr. Solomon Jacobs's
      establishment, on which most of his visitors were very happy when they
      found themselves once again-to wit, the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, as they drove to Norwood together-'you
      shall have an opportunity to make the disclosure to-night, and mind you
      speak out, Tottle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will-I will!' replied Watkins, valorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How I should like to see you together,' ejaculated Mr. Gabriel
      Parsons.-'What fun!' and he laughed so long and so loudly, that he
      disconcerted Mr. Watkins Tottle, and frightened the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's Fanny and your intended walking about on the lawn,' said Gabriel,
      as they approached the house. 'Mind your eye, Tottle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never fear,' replied Watkins, resolutely, as he made his way to the spot
      where the ladies were walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's Mr. Tottle, my dear,' said Mrs. Parsons, addressing Miss
      Lillerton. The lady turned quickly round, and acknowledged his courteous
      salute with the same sort of confusion that Watkins had noticed on their
      first interview, but with something like a slight expression of
      disappointment or carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you see how glad she was to see you?' whispered Parsons to his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I really thought she looked as if she would rather have seen
      somebody else,' replied Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pooh, nonsense!' whispered Parsons again-'it's always the way with the
      women, young or old. They never show how delighted they are to see those
      whose presence makes their hearts beat. It's the way with the whole sex,
      and no man should have lived to your time of life without knowing it.
      Fanny confessed it to me, when we were first married, over and over
      again-see what it is to have a wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' whispered Tottle, whose courage was vanishing fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, now, you'd better begin to pave the way,' said Parsons, who, having
      invested some money in the speculation, assumed the office of director.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, I will-presently,' replied Tottle, greatly flurried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say something to her, man,' urged Parsons again. 'Confound it! pay her a
      compliment, can't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! not till after dinner,' replied the bashful Tottle, anxious to
      postpone the evil moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, gentlemen,' said Mrs. Parsons, 'you are really very polite; you
      stay away the whole morning, after promising to take us out, and when you
      do come home, you stand whispering together and take no notice of us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We were talking of the business, my dear, which detained us this
      morning,' replied Parsons, looking significantly at Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me! how very quickly the morning has gone,' said Miss Lillerton,
      referring to the gold watch, which was wound up on state occasions,
      whether it required it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it has passed very slowly,' mildly suggested Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ('That's right-bravo!') whispered Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed!' said Miss Lillerton, with an air of majestic surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can only impute it to my unavoidable absence from your society, madam,'
      said Watkins, 'and that of Mrs. Parsons.'
    </p>
    <p>
      During this short dialogue, the ladies had been leading the way to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What the deuce did you stick Fanny into that last compliment for?'
      inquired Parsons, as they followed together; 'it quite spoilt the effect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! it really would have been too broad without,' replied Watkins Tottle,
      'much too broad!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's mad!' Parsons whispered his wife, as they entered the drawing- room,
      'mad from modesty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me!' ejaculated the lady, 'I never heard of such a thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll find we have quite a family dinner, Mr. Tottle,' said Mrs.
      Parsons, when they sat down to table: 'Miss Lillerton is one of us, and,
      of course, we make no stranger of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle expressed a hope that the Parsons family never would
      make a stranger of him; and wished internally that his bashfulness would
      allow him to feel a little less like a stranger himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take off the covers, Martha,' said Mrs. Parsons, directing the shifting
      of the scenery with great anxiety. The order was obeyed, and a pair of
      boiled fowls, with tongue and et ceteras, were displayed at the top, and a
      fillet of veal at the bottom. On one side of the table two green
      sauce-tureens, with ladles of the same, were setting to each other in a
      green dish; and on the other was a curried rabbit, in a brown suit, turned
      up with lemon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Lillerton, my dear,' said Mrs. Parsons, 'shall I assist you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, no; I think I'll trouble Mr. Tottle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Watkins started-trembled-helped the rabbit-and broke a tumbler. The
      countenance of the lady of the house, which had been all smiles
      previously, underwent an awful change.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Extremely sorry,' stammered Watkins, assisting himself to currie and
      parsley and butter, in the extremity of his confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not the least consequence,' replied Mrs. Parsons, in a tone which implied
      that it was of the greatest consequence possible,-directing aside the
      researches of the boy, who was groping under the table for the bits of
      broken glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I presume,' said Miss Lillerton, 'that Mr. Tottle is aware of the
      interest which bachelors usually pay in such cases; a dozen glasses for
      one is the lowest penalty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons gave his friend an admonitory tread on the toe. Here
      was a clear hint that the sooner he ceased to be a bachelor and
      emancipated himself from such penalties, the better. Mr. Watkins Tottle
      viewed the observation in the same light, and challenged Mrs. Parsons to
      take wine, with a degree of presence of mind, which, under all the
      circumstances, was really extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Lillerton,' said Gabriel, 'may I have the pleasure?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be most happy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tottle, will you assist Miss Lillerton, and pass the decanter. Thank
      you.' (The usual pantomimic ceremony of nodding and sipping gone through)-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tottle, were you ever in Suffolk?' inquired the master of the house, who
      was burning to tell one of his seven stock stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' responded Watkins, adding, by way of a saving clause, 'but I've been
      in Devonshire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' replied Gabriel, 'it was in Suffolk that a rather singular
      circumstance happened to me many years ago. Did you ever happen to hear me
      mention it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle had happened to hear his friend mention it some four
      hundred times. Of course he expressed great curiosity, and evinced the
      utmost impatience to hear the story again. Mr. Gabriel Parsons forthwith
      attempted to proceed, in spite of the interruptions to which, as our
      readers must frequently have observed, the master of the house is often
      exposed in such cases. We will attempt to give them an idea of our
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When I was in Suffolk-' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take off the fowls first, Martha,' said Mrs. Parsons. 'I beg your pardon,
      my dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When I was in Suffolk,' resumed Mr. Parsons, with an impatient glance at
      his wife, who pretended not to observe it, 'which is now years ago,
      business led me to the town of Bury St. Edmund's. I had to stop at the
      principal places in my way, and therefore, for the sake of convenience, I
      travelled in a gig. I left Sudbury one dark night-it was winter time-about
      nine o'clock; the rain poured in torrents, the wind howled among the trees
      that skirted the roadside, and I was obliged to proceed at a foot-pace,
      for I could hardly see my hand before me, it was so dark-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'John,' interrupted Mrs. Parsons, in a low, hollow voice, 'don't spill
      that gravy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fanny,' said Parsons impatiently, 'I wish you'd defer these domestic
      reproofs to some more suitable time. Really, my dear, these constant
      interruptions are very annoying.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, I didn't interrupt you,' said Mrs. Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dear, you did interrupt me,' remonstrated Mr. Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How very absurd you are, my love! I must give directions to the servants;
      I am quite sure that if I sat here and allowed John to spill the gravy
      over the new carpet, you'd be the first to find fault when you saw the
      stain to-morrow morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' continued Gabriel with a resigned air, as if he knew there was no
      getting over the point about the carpet, 'I was just saying, it was so
      dark that I could hardly see my hand before me. The road was very lonely,
      and I assure you, Tottle (this was a device to arrest the wandering
      attention of that individual, which was distracted by a confidential
      communication between Mrs. Parsons and Martha, accompanied by the delivery
      of a large bunch of keys), I assure you, Tottle, I became somehow
      impressed with a sense of the loneliness of my situation-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pie to your master,' interrupted Mrs. Parsons, again directing the
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, pray, my dear,' remonstrated Parsons once more, very pettishly. Mrs.
      P. turned up her hands and eyebrows, and appealed in dumb show to Miss
      Lillerton. 'As I turned a corner of the road,' resumed Gabriel, 'the horse
      stopped short, and reared tremendously. I pulled up, jumped out, ran to
      his head, and found a man lying on his back in the middle of the road,
      with his eyes fixed on the sky. I thought he was dead; but no, he was
      alive, and there appeared to be nothing the matter with him. He jumped up,
      and potting his hand to his chest, and fixing upon me the most earnest
      gaze you can imagine, exclaimed-'Pudding here,' said Mrs. Parsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! it's no use,' exclaimed the host, now rendered desperate. 'Here,
      Tottle; a glass of wine. It's useless to attempt relating anything when
      Mrs. Parsons is present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This attack was received in the usual way. Mrs. Parsons talked to Miss
      Lillerton and at her better half; expatiated on the impatience of men
      generally; hinted that her husband was peculiarly vicious in this respect,
      and wound up by insinuating that she must be one of the best tempers that
      ever existed, or she never could put up with it. Really what she had to
      endure sometimes, was more than any one who saw her in every-day life
      could by possibility suppose.-The story was now a painful subject, and
      therefore Mr. Parsons declined to enter into any details, and contented
      himself by stating that the man was a maniac, who had escaped from a
      neighbouring mad-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloth was removed; the ladies soon afterwards retired, and Miss
      Lillerton played the piano in the drawing-room overhead, very loudly, for
      the edification of the visitor. Mr. Watkins Tottle and Mr. Gabriel Parsons
      sat chatting comfortably enough, until the conclusion of the second
      bottle, when the latter, in proposing an adjournment to the drawing-room,
      informed Watkins that he had concerted a plan with his wife, for leaving
      him and Miss Lillerton alone, soon after tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say,' said Tottle, as they went up-stairs, 'don't you think it would be
      better if we put it off till-till-to-morrow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you think it would have been much better if I had left you in that
      wretched hole I found you in this morning?' retorted Parsons bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well-well-I only made a suggestion,' said poor Watkins Tottle, with a
      deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea was soon concluded, and Miss Lillerton, drawing a small work-table on
      one side of the fire, and placing a little wooden frame upon it, something
      like a miniature clay-mill without the horse, was soon busily engaged in
      making a watch-guard with brown silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'God bless me!' exclaimed Parsons, starting up with well-feigned surprise,
      'I've forgotten those confounded letters. Tottle, I know you'll excuse
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      If Tottle had been a free agent, he would have allowed no one to leave the
      room on any pretence, except himself. As it was, however, he was obliged
      to look cheerful when Parsons quitted the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely left, when Martha put her head into the room,
      with-'Please, ma'am, you're wanted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Parsons left the room, shut the door carefully after her, and Mr.
      Watkins Tottle was left alone with Miss Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first five minutes there was a dead silence.-Mr. Watkins Tottle
      was thinking how he should begin, and Miss Lillerton appeared to be
      thinking of nothing. The fire was burning low; Mr. Watkins Tottle stirred
      it, and put some coals on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hem!' coughed Miss Lillerton; Mr. Watkins Tottle thought the fair
      creature had spoken. 'I beg your pardon,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought you spoke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There are some books on the sofa, Mr. Tottle, if you would like to look
      at them,' said Miss Lillerton, after the lapse of another five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you,' returned Watkins; and then he added, with a courage which
      was perfectly astonishing, even to himself, 'Madam, that is Miss
      Lillerton, I wish to speak to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To me!' said Miss Lillerton, letting the silk drop from her hands, and
      sliding her chair back a few paces.-'Speak-to me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To you, madam-and on the subject of the state of your affections.' The
      lady hastily rose and would have left the room; but Mr. Watkins Tottle
      gently detained her by the hand, and holding it as far from him as the
      joint length of their arms would permit, he thus proceeded: 'Pray do not
      misunderstand me, or suppose that I am led to address you, after so short
      an acquaintance, by any feeling of my own merits-for merits I have none
      which could give me a claim to your hand. I hope you will acquit me of any
      presumption when I explain that I have been acquainted through Mrs.
      Parsons, with the state-that is, that Mrs. Parsons has told me-at least,
      not Mrs. Parsons, but-' here Watkins began to wander, but Miss Lillerton
      relieved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Am I to understand, Mr. Tottle, that Mrs. Parsons has acquainted you with
      my feeling-my affection-I mean my respect, for an individual of the
      opposite sex?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, what?' inquired Miss Lillerton, averting her face, with a girlish
      air, 'what could induce you to seek such an interview as this? What can
      your object be? How can I promote your happiness, Mr. Tottle?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the time for a flourish-'By allowing me,' replied Watkins,
      falling bump on his knees, and breaking two brace-buttons and a
      waistcoat-string, in the act-'By allowing me to be your slave, your
      servant-in short, by unreservedly making me the confidant of your heart's
      feelings-may I say for the promotion of your own happiness-may I say, in
      order that you may become the wife of a kind and affectionate husband?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Disinterested creature!' exclaimed Miss Lillerton, hiding her face in a
      white pocket-handkerchief with an eyelet-hole border.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle thought that if the lady knew all, she might possibly
      alter her opinion on this last point. He raised the tip of her middle
      finger ceremoniously to his lips, and got off his knees, as gracefully as
      he could. 'My information was correct?' he tremulously inquired, when he
      was once more on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was.' Watkins elevated his hands, and looked up to the ornament in the
      centre of the ceiling, which had been made for a lamp, by way of
      expressing his rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our situation, Mr. Tottle,' resumed the lady, glancing at him through one
      of the eyelet-holes, 'is a most peculiar. and delicate one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is,' said Mr. Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our acquaintance has been of so short duration,' said Miss Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only a week,' assented Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! more than that,' exclaimed the lady, in a tone of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed!' said Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'More than a month-more than two months!' said Miss Lillerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather odd, this,' thought Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' he said, recollecting Parsons's assurance that she had known him
      from report, 'I understand. But, my dear madam, pray, consider. The longer
      this acquaintance has existed, the less reason is I there for delay now.
      Why not at once fix a period for gratifying the hopes of your devoted
      admirer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has been represented to me again and again that this is the course I
      ought to pursue,' replied Miss Lillerton, 'but pardon my feelings of
      delicacy, Mr. Tottle-pray excuse this embarrassment-I have peculiar ideas
      on such subjects, and I am quite sure that I never could summon up
      fortitude enough to name the day to my future husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then allow me to name it,' said Tottle eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to fix it myself,' replied Miss Lillerton, bashfully, but I
      cannot do so without at once resorting to a third party.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A third party!' thought Watkins Tottle; 'who the deuce is that to be, I
      wonder!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Tottle,' continued Miss Lillerton, 'you have made me a most
      disinterested and kind offer-that offer I accept. Will you at once be the
      bearer of a note from me to-to Mr. Timson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Timson!' said Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'After what has passed between us,' responded Miss Lillerton, still
      averting her head, 'you must understand whom I mean; Mr. Timson,
      the-the-clergyman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Timson, the clergyman!' ejaculated Watkins Tottle, in a state of
      inexpressible beatitude, and positive wonder at his own success. 'Angel!
      Certainly-this moment!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll prepare it immediately,' said Miss Lillerton, making for the door;
      'the events of this day have flurried me so much, Mr. Tottle, that I shall
      not leave my room again this evening; I will send you the note by the
      servant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stay,-stay,' cried Watkins Tottle, still keeping a most respectful
      distance from the lady; 'when shall we meet again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! Mr. Tottle,' replied Miss Lillerton, coquettishly, 'when we are
      married, I can never see you too often, nor thank you too much;' and she
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle flung himself into an arm-chair, and indulged in the
      most delicious reveries of future bliss, in which the idea of 'Five
      hundred pounds per annum, with an uncontrolled power of disposing of it by
      her last will and testament,' was somehow or other the foremost. He had
      gone through the interview so well, and it had terminated so admirably,
      that he almost began to wish he had expressly stipulated for the
      settlement of the annual five hundred on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I come in?' said Mr. Gabriel Parsons, peeping in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may,' replied Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, have you done it?' anxiously inquired Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have I done it!' said Watkins Tottle. 'Hush-I'm going to the clergyman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' said Parsons. 'How well you have managed it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where does Timson live?' inquired Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At his uncle's,' replied Gabriel, 'just round the lane. He's waiting for
      a living, and has been assisting his uncle here for the last two or three
      months. But how well you have done it-I didn't think you could have
      carried it off so!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle was proceeding to demonstrate that the Richardsonian
      principle was the best on which love could possibly be made, when he was
      interrupted by the entrance of Martha, with a little pink note folded like
      a fancy cocked-hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Lillerton's compliments,' said Martha, as she delivered it into
      Tottle's hands, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you observe the delicacy?' said Tottle, appealing to Mr. Gabriel
      Parsons. 'Compliments, not love, by the servant, eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons didn't exactly know what reply to make, so he poked
      the forefinger of his right hand between the third and fourth ribs of Mr.
      Watkins Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come,' said Watkins, when the explosion of mirth, consequent on this
      practical jest, had subsided, 'we'll be off at once-let's lose no time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital!' echoed Gabriel Parsons; and in five minutes they were at the
      garden-gate of the villa tenanted by the uncle of Mr. Timson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mr. Charles Timson at home?' inquired Mr. Watkins Tottle of Mr.
      Charles Timson's uncle's man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Charles is at home,' replied the man, stammering; 'but he desired me
      to say he couldn't be interrupted, sir, by any of the parishioners.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not a parishioner,' replied Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mr. Charles writing a sermon, Tom?' inquired Parsons, thrusting
      himself forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Mr. Parsons, sir; he's not exactly writing a sermon, but he is
      practising the violoncello in his own bedroom, and gave strict orders not
      to be disturbed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say I'm here,' replied Gabriel, leading the way across the garden; 'Mr.
      Parsons and Mr. Tottle, on private and particular business.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They were shown into the parlour, and the servant departed to deliver his
      message. The distant groaning of the violoncello ceased; footsteps were
      heard on the stairs; and Mr. Timson presented himself, and shook hands
      with Parsons with the utmost cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you do, sir?' said Watkins Tottle, with great solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you do, sir?' replied Timson, with as much coldness as if it were
      a matter of perfect indifference to him how he did, as it very likely was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg to deliver this note to you,' said Watkins Tottle, producing the
      cocked-hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From Miss Lillerton!' said Timson, suddenly changing colour. 'Pray sit
      down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle sat down; and while Timson perused the note, fixed his
      eyes on an oyster-sauce-coloured portrait of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
      which hung over the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Timson rose from his seat when he had concluded the note, and looked
      dubiously at Parsons. 'May I ask,' he inquired, appealing to Watkins
      Tottle, 'whether our friend here is acquainted with the object of your
      visit?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our friend is in my confidence,' replied Watkins, with considerable
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, sir,' said Timson, seizing both Tottle's hands, 'allow me in his
      presence to thank you most unfeignedly and cordially, for the noble part
      you have acted in this affair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He thinks I recommended him,' thought Tottle. 'Confound these fellows!
      they never think of anything but their fees.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I deeply regret having misunderstood your intentions, my dear sir,'
      continued Timson. 'Disinterested and manly, indeed! There are very few men
      who would have acted as you have done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle could not help thinking that this last remark was
      anything but complimentary. He therefore inquired, rather hastily, 'When
      is it to be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On Thursday,' replied Timson,-'on Thursday morning at half-past eight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uncommonly early,' observed Watkins Tottle, with an air of triumphant
      self-denial. 'I shall hardly be able to get down here by that hour.' (This
      was intended for a joke.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind, my dear fellow,' replied Timson, all suavity, shaking hands
      with Tottle again most heartily, 'so long as we see you to breakfast, you
      know-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh!' said Parsons, with one of the most extraordinary expressions of
      countenance that ever appeared in a human face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What!' ejaculated Watkins Tottle, at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say that so long as we see you to breakfast,' replied Timson, 'we will
      excuse your being absent from the ceremony, though of course your presence
      at it would give us the utmost pleasure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkins Tottle staggered against the wall, and fixed his eyes on
      Timson with appalling perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Timson,' said Parsons, hurriedly brushing his hat with his left arm,
      'when you say "us," whom do you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Timson looked foolish in his turn, when he replied, 'Why-Mrs. Timson
      that will be this day week: Miss Lillerton that is-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now don't stare at that idiot in the corner,' angrily exclaimed Parsons,
      as the extraordinary convulsions of Watkins Tottle's countenance excited
      the wondering gaze of Timson,-'but have the goodness to tell me in three
      words the contents of that note?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This note,' replied Timson, 'is from Miss Lillerton, to whom I have been
      for the last five weeks regularly engaged. Her singular scruples and
      strange feeling on some points have hitherto prevented my bringing the
      engagement to that termination which I so anxiously desire. She informs me
      here, that she sounded Mrs. Parsons with the view of making her her
      confidante and go-between, that Mrs. Parsons informed this elderly
      gentleman, Mr. Tottle, of the circumstance, and that he, in the most kind
      and delicate terms, offered to assist us in any way, and even undertook to
      convey this note, which contains the promise I have long sought in vain-an
      act of kindness for which I can never be sufficiently grateful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good night, Timson,' said Parsons, hurrying off, and carrying the
      bewildered Tottle with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you stay-and have something?' said Timson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank ye,' replied Parsons; 'I've had quite enough;' and away he
      went, followed by Watkins Tottle in a state of stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gabriel Parsons whistled until they had walked some quarter of a mile
      past his own gate, when he suddenly stopped, and said-
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are a clever fellow, Tottle, ain't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know,' said the unfortunate Watkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose you'll say this is Fanny's fault, won't you?' inquired Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know anything about it,' replied the bewildered Tottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said Parsons, turning on his heel to go home, 'the next time you
      make an offer, you had better speak plainly, and don't throw a chance
      away. And the next time you're locked up in a spunging-house, just wait
      there till I come and take you out, there's a good fellow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      How, or at what hour, Mr. Watkins Tottle returned to Cecil-street is
      unknown. His boots were seen outside his bedroom-door next morning; but we
      have the authority of his landlady for stating that he neither emerged
      therefrom nor accepted sustenance for four-and-twenty hours. At the
      expiration of that period, and when a council of war was being held in the
      kitchen on the propriety of summoning the parochial beadle to break his
      door open, he rang his bell, and demanded a cup of milk-and- water. The
      next morning he went through the formalities of eating and drinking as
      usual, but a week afterwards he was seized with a relapse, while perusing
      the list of marriages in a morning paper, from which he never perfectly
      recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after the last-named occurrence, the body of a gentleman
      unknown, was found in the Regent's canal. In the trousers-pockets were
      four shillings and threepence halfpenny; a matrimonial advertisement from
      a lady, which appeared to have been cut out of a Sunday paper: a
      tooth-pick, and a card-case, which it is confidently believed would have
      led to the identification of the unfortunate gentleman, but for the
      circumstance of there being none but blank cards in it. Mr. Watkins Tottle
      absented himself from his lodgings shortly before. A bill, which has not
      been taken up, was presented next morning; and a bill, which has not been
      taken down, was soon afterwards affixed in his parlour-window.

      CHAPTER XI-THE BLOOMSBURY CHRISTENING
    </h2>

      Mr. Nicodemus Dumps, or, as his acquaintance called him, 'long Dumps,' was
      a bachelor, six feet high, and fifty years old: cross, cadaverous, odd,
      and ill-natured. He was never happy but when he was miserable; and always
      miserable when he had the best reason to be happy. The only real comfort
      of his existence was to make everybody about him wretched-then he might be
      truly said to enjoy life. He was afflicted with a situation in the Bank
      worth five hundred a-year, and he rented a 'first-floor furnished,' at
      Pentonville, which he originally took because it commanded a dismal
      prospect of an adjacent churchyard. He was familiar with the face of every
      tombstone, and the burial service seemed to excite his strongest sympathy.
      His friends said he was surly-he insisted he was nervous; they thought him
      a lucky dog, but he protested that he was 'the most unfortunate man in the
      world.' Cold as he was, and wretched as he declared himself to be, he was
      not wholly unsusceptible of attachments. He revered the memory of Hoyle,
      as he was himself an admirable and imperturbable whist-player, and he
      chuckled with delight at a fretful and impatient adversary. He adored King
      Herod for his massacre of the innocents; and if he hated one thing more
      than another, it was a child. However, he could hardly be said to hate
      anything in particular, because he disliked everything in general; but
      perhaps his greatest antipathies were cabs, old women, doors that would
      not shut, musical amateurs, and omnibus cads. He subscribed to the
      'Society for the Suppression of Vice' for the pleasure of putting a stop
      to any harmless amusements; and he contributed largely towards the support
      of two itinerant methodist parsons, in the amiable hope that if
      circumstances rendered any people happy in this world, they might
      perchance be rendered miserable by fears for the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dumps had a nephew who had been married about a year, and who was
      somewhat of a favourite with his uncle, because he was an admirable
      subject to exercise his misery-creating powers upon. Mr. Charles
      Kitterbell was a small, sharp, spare man, with a very large head, and a
      broad, good-humoured countenance. He looked like a faded giant, with the
      head and face partially restored; and he had a cast in his eye which
      rendered it quite impossible for any one with whom he conversed to know
      where he was looking. His eyes appeared fixed on the wall, and he was
      staring you out of countenance; in short, there was no catching his eye,
      and perhaps it is a merciful dispensation of Providence that such eyes are
      not catching. In addition to these characteristics, it may be added that
      Mr. Charles Kitterbell was one of the most credulous and matter-of- fact
      little personages that ever took to himself a wife, and for himself a
      house in Great Russell-street, Bedford-square. (Uncle Dumps always dropped
      the 'Bedford-square,' and inserted in lieu thereof the dreadful words
      'Tottenham-court-road.')
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but, uncle, 'pon my life you must-you must promise to be godfather,'
      said Mr. Kitterbell, as he sat in conversation with his respected relative
      one morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot, indeed I cannot,' returned Dumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, but why not? Jemima will think it very unkind. It's very little
      trouble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As to the trouble,' rejoined the most unhappy man in existence, 'I don't
      mind that; but my nerves are in that state-I cannot go through the
      ceremony. You know I don't like going out.-For God's sake, Charles, don't
      fidget with that stool so; you'll drive me mad.' Mr. Kitterbell, quite
      regardless of his uncle's nerves, had occupied himself for some ten
      minutes in describing a circle on the floor with one leg of the
      office-stool on which he was seated, keeping the other three up in the
      air, and holding fast on by the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, uncle,' said Kitterbell, quite abashed, suddenly
      releasing his hold of the desk, and bringing the three wandering legs back
      to the floor, with a force sufficient to drive them through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But come, don't refuse. If it's a boy, you know, we must have two
      godfathers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If it's a boy!' said Dumps; 'why can't you say at once whether it is a
      boy or not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should be very happy to tell you, but it's impossible I can undertake
      to say whether it's a girl or a boy, if the child isn't born yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not born yet!' echoed Dumps, with a gleam of hope lighting up his
      lugubrious visage. 'Oh, well, it may be a girl, and then you won't want
      me; or if it is a boy, it may die before it is christened.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope not,' said the father that expected to be, looking very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope not,' acquiesced Dumps, evidently pleased with the subject. He was
      beginning to get happy. 'I hope not, but distressing cases frequently
      occur during the first two or three days of a child's life; fits, I am
      told, are exceedingly common, and alarming convulsions are almost matters
      of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord, uncle!' ejaculated little Kitterbell, gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; my landlady was confined-let me see-last Tuesday: an uncommonly fine
      boy. On the Thursday night the nurse was sitting with him upon her knee
      before the fire, and he was as well as possible. Suddenly he became black
      in the face, and alarmingly spasmodic. The medical man was instantly sent
      for, and every remedy was tried, but-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How frightful!' interrupted the horror-stricken Kitterbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The child died, of course. However, your child may not die; and if it
      should be a boy, and should live to be christened, why I suppose I must be
      one of the sponsors.' Dumps was evidently good-natured on the faith of his
      anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, uncle,' said his agitated nephew, grasping his hand as warmly
      as if he had done him some essential service. 'Perhaps I had better not
      tell Mrs. K. what you have mentioned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, if she's low-spirited, perhaps you had better not mention the
      melancholy case to her,' returned Dumps, who of course had invented the
      whole story; 'though perhaps it would be but doing your duty as a husband
      to prepare her for the worst.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two afterwards, as Dumps was perusing a morning paper at the
      chop-house which he regularly frequented, the following-paragraph met his
      eyes:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Births.-On Saturday, the 18th inst., in Great Russell-street, the lady of
      Charles Kitterbell, Esq., of a son.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a boy!' he exclaimed, dashing down the paper, to the astonishment
      of the waiters. 'It is a boy!' But he speedily regained his composure as
      his eye rested on a paragraph quoting the number of infant deaths from the
      bills of mortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six weeks passed away, and as no communication had been received from the
      Kitterbells, Dumps was beginning to flatter himself that the child was
      dead, when the following note painfully resolved his doubts:-
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great Russell-street, Monday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Uncle,-You will be delighted to hear that my dear Jemima has left
      her room, and that your future godson is getting on capitally. He was very
      thin at first, but he is getting much larger, and nurse says he is filling
      out every day. He cries a good deal, and is a very singular colour, which
      made Jemima and me rather uncomfortable; but as nurse says it's natural,
      and as of course we know nothing about these things yet, we are quite
      satisfied with what nurse says. We think he will be a sharp child; and
      nurse says she's sure he will, because he never goes to sleep. You will
      readily believe that we are all very happy, only we're a little worn out
      for want of rest, as he keeps us awake all night; but this we must expect,
      nurse says, for the first six or eight months. He has been vaccinated, but
      in consequence of the operation being rather awkwardly performed, some
      small particles of glass were introduced into the arm with the matter.
      Perhaps this may in some degree account for his being rather fractious; at
      least, so nurse says. We propose to have him christened at twelve o'clock
      on Friday, at Saint George's church, in Hart-street, by the name of
      Frederick Charles William. Pray don't be later than a quarter before
      twelve. We shall have a very few friends in the evening, when of course we
      shall see you. I am sorry to say that the dear boy appears rather restless
      and uneasy to-day: the cause, I fear, is fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Believe me, dear Uncle, 'Yours affectionately, 'Charles Kitterbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'P.S.-I open this note to say that we have just discovered the cause of
      little Frederick's restlessness. It is not fever, as I apprehended, but a
      small pin, which nurse accidentally stuck in his leg yesterday evening. We
      have taken it out, and he appears more composed, though he still sobs a
      good deal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is almost unnecessary to say that the perusal of the above interesting
      statement was no great relief to the mind of the hypochondriacal Dumps. It
      was impossible to recede, however, and so he put the best face-that is to
      say, an uncommonly miserable one-upon the matter; and purchased a handsome
      silver mug for the infant Kitterbell, upon which he ordered the initials
      'F. C. W. K.,' with the customary untrained grape-vine-looking flourishes,
      and a large full stop, to be engraved forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday was a fine day, Tuesday was delightful, Wednesday was equal to
      either, and Thursday was finer than ever; four successive fine days in
      London! Hackney-coachmen became revolutionary, and crossing-sweepers began
      to doubt the existence of a First Cause. The Morning Herald informed its
      readers that an old woman in Camden Town had been heard to say that the
      fineness of the season was 'unprecedented in the memory of the oldest
      inhabitant;' and Islington clerks, with large families and small salaries,
      left off their black gaiters, disdained to carry their once green cotton
      umbrellas, and walked to town in the conscious pride of white stockings
      and cleanly brushed Bluchers. Dumps beheld all this with an eye of supreme
      contempt-his triumph was at hand. He knew that if it had been fine for
      four weeks instead of four days, it would rain when he went out; he was
      lugubriously happy in the conviction that Friday would be a wretched
      day-and so it was. 'I knew how it would be,' said Dumps, as he turned
      round opposite the Mansion-house at half-past eleven o'clock on the Friday
      morning. 'I knew how it would be. I am concerned, and that's enough;'-and
      certainly the appearance of the day was sufficient to depress the spirits
      of a much more buoyant-hearted individual than himself. It had rained,
      without a moment's cessation, since eight o'clock; everybody that passed
      up Cheapside, and down Cheapside, looked wet, cold, and dirty. All sorts
      of forgotten and long-concealed umbrellas had been put into requisition.
      Cabs whisked about, with the 'fare' as carefully boxed up behind two
      glazed calico curtains as any mysterious picture in any one of Mrs.
      Radcliffe's castles; omnibus horses smoked like steam-engines; nobody
      thought of 'standing up' under doorways or arches; they were painfully
      convinced it was a hopeless case; and so everybody went hastily along,
      jumbling and jostling, and swearing and perspiring, and slipping about,
      like amateur skaters behind wooden chairs on the Serpentine on a frosty
      Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumps paused; he could not think of walking, being rather smart for the
      christening. If he took a cab he was sure to be spilt, and a hackney-
      coach was too expensive for his economical ideas. An omnibus was waiting
      at the opposite corner-it was a desperate case-he had never heard of an
      omnibus upsetting or running away, and if the cad did knock him down, he
      could 'pull him up' in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, sir!' cried the young gentleman who officiated as 'cad' to the 'Lads
      of the Village,' which was the name of the machine just noticed. Dumps
      crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This vay, sir!' shouted the driver of the 'Hark-away,' pulling up his
      vehicle immediately across the door of the opposition-'This vay, sir-he's
      full.' Dumps hesitated, whereupon the 'Lads of the Village' commenced
      pouring out a torrent of abuse against the 'Hark-away;' but the conductor
      of the 'Admiral Napier' settled the contest in a most satisfactory manner,
      for all parties, by seizing Dumps round the waist, and thrusting him into
      the middle of his vehicle which had just come up and only wanted the
      sixteenth inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right,' said the 'Admiral,' and off the thing thundered, like a
      fire-engine at full gallop, with the kidnapped customer inside, standing
      in the position of a half doubled-up bootjack, and falling about with
      every jerk of the machine, first on the one side, and then on the other,
      like a 'Jack-in-the-green,' on May-day, setting to the lady with a brass
      ladle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For Heaven's sake, where am I to sit?' inquired the miserable man of an
      old gentleman, into whose stomach he had just fallen for the fourth time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anywhere but on my chest, sir,' replied the old gentleman in a surly
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps the box would suit the gentleman better,' suggested a very damp
      lawyer's clerk, in a pink shirt, and a smirking countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a great deal of struggling and falling about, Dumps at last managed
      to squeeze himself into a seat, which, in addition to the slight
      disadvantage of being between a window that would not shut, and a door
      that must be open, placed him in close contact with a passenger, who had
      been walking about all the morning without an umbrella, and who looked as
      if he had spent the day in a full water-butt-only wetter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't bang the door so,' said Dumps to the conductor, as he shut it after
      letting out four of the passengers; I am very nervous-it destroys me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did any gen'lm'n say anythink?' replied the cad, thrusting in his head,
      and trying to look as if he didn't understand the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I told you not to bang the door so!' repeated Dumps, with an expression
      of countenance like the knave of clubs, in convulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! vy, it's rather a sing'ler circumstance about this here door, sir,
      that it von't shut without banging,' replied the conductor; and he opened
      the door very wide, and shut it again with a terrific bang, in proof of
      the assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, sir,' said a little prim, wheezing old gentleman,
      sitting opposite Dumps, 'I beg your pardon; but have you ever observed,
      when you have been in an omnibus on a wet day, that four people out of
      five always come in with large cotton umbrellas, without a handle at the
      top, or the brass spike at the bottom?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, sir,' returned Dumps, as he heard the clock strike twelve, 'it never
      struck me before; but now you mention it, I-Hollo! hollo!' shouted the
      persecuted individual, as the omnibus dashed past Drury-lane, where he had
      directed to be set down.-'Where is the cad?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think he's on the box, sir,' said the young gentleman before noticed in
      the pink shirt, which looked like a white one ruled with red ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to be set down!' said Dumps in a faint voice, overcome by his
      previous efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think these cads want to be set down,' returned the attorney's clerk,
      chuckling at his sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hollo!' cried Dumps again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hollo!' echoed the passengers. The omnibus passed St. Giles's church.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hold hard!' said the conductor; 'I'm blowed if we ha'n't forgot the
      gen'lm'n as vas to be set down at Doory-lane.-Now, sir, make haste, if you
      please,' he added, opening the door, and assisting Dumps out with as much
      coolness as if it was 'all right.' Dumps's indignation was for once
      getting the better of his cynical equanimity. 'Drury-lane!' he gasped,
      with the voice of a boy in a cold bath for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Doory-lane, sir?-yes, sir,-third turning on the right-hand side, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumps's passion was paramount: he clutched his umbrella, and was striding
      off with the firm determination of not paying the fare. The cad, by a
      remarkable coincidence, happened to entertain a directly contrary opinion,
      and Heaven knows how far the altercation would have proceeded, if it had
      not been most ably and satisfactorily brought to a close by the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hollo!' said that respectable person, standing up on the box, and leaning
      with one hand on the roof of the omnibus. 'Hollo, Tom! tell the gentleman
      if so be as he feels aggrieved, we will take him up to the Edge-er
      (Edgeware) Road for nothing, and set him down at Doory-lane when we comes
      back. He can't reject that, anyhow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument was irresistible: Dumps paid the disputed sixpence, and in a
      quarter of an hour was on the staircase of No. 14, Great Russell- street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything indicated that preparations were making for the reception of 'a
      few friends' in the evening. Two dozen extra tumblers, and four ditto
      wine-glasses-looking anything but transparent, with little bits of straw
      in them on the slab in the passage, just arrived. There was a great smell
      of nutmeg, port wine, and almonds, on the staircase; the covers were taken
      off the stair-carpet, and the figure of Venus on the first landing looked
      as if she were ashamed of the composition-candle in her right hand, which
      contrasted beautifully with the lamp-blacked drapery of the goddess of
      love. The female servant (who looked very warm and bustling) ushered Dumps
      into a front drawing-room, very prettily furnished, with a plentiful
      sprinkling of little baskets, paper table-mats, china watchmen, pink and
      gold albums, and rainbow-bound little books on the different tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, uncle!' said Mr. Kitterbell, 'how d'ye do? Allow me-Jemima, my
      dear-my uncle. I think you've seen Jemima before, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have had the pleasure,' returned big Dumps, his tone and look making it
      doubtful whether in his life he had ever experienced the sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure,' said Mrs. Kitterbell, with a languid smile, and a slight
      cough. 'I'm sure-hem-any friend-of Charles's-hem-much less a relation,
      is-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I knew you'd say so, my love,' said little Kitterbell, who, while he
      appeared to be gazing on the opposite houses, was looking at his wife with
      a most affectionate air: 'Bless you!' The last two words were accompanied
      with a simper, and a squeeze of the hand, which stirred up all Uncle
      Dumps's bile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jane, tell nurse to bring down baby,' said Mrs. Kitterbell, addressing
      the servant. Mrs. Kitterbell was a tall, thin young lady, with very light
      hair, and a particularly white face-one of those young women who almost
      invariably, though one hardly knows why, recall to one's mind the idea of
      a cold fillet of veal. Out went the servant, and in came the nurse, with a
      remarkably small parcel in her arms, packed up in a blue mantle trimmed
      with white fur.-This was the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, uncle,' said Mr. Kitterbell, lifting up that part of the mantle
      which covered the infant's face, with an air of great triumph, 'Who do you
      think he's like?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He! he! Yes, who?' said Mrs. K., putting her arm through her husband's,
      and looking up into Dumps's face with an expression of as much interest as
      she was capable of displaying.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good God, how small he is!' cried the amiable uncle, starting back with
      well-feigned surprise; 'remarkably small indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think so?' inquired poor little Kitterbell, rather alarmed. 'He's
      a monster to what he was-ain't he, nurse?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's a dear,' said the nurse, squeezing the child, and evading the
      question-not because she scrupled to disguise the fact, but because she
      couldn't afford to throw away the chance of Dumps's half-crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, but who is he like?' inquired little Kitterbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumps looked at the little pink heap before him, and only thought at the
      moment of the best mode of mortifying the youthful parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I really don't know who he's like,' he answered, very well knowing the
      reply expected of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you think he's like me?' inquired his nephew with a knowing air.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, decidedly not!' returned Dumps, with an emphasis not to be
      misunderstood. 'Decidedly not like you.-Oh, certainly not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like Jemima?' asked Kitterbell, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, dear no; not in the least. I'm no judge, of course, in such cases;
      but I really think he's more like one of those little carved
      representations that one sometimes sees blowing a trumpet on a tombstone!'
      The nurse stooped down over the child, and with great difficulty prevented
      an explosion of mirth. Pa and ma looked almost as miserable as their
      amiable uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well!' said the disappointed little father, 'you'll be better able to
      tell what he's like by-and-by. You shall see him this evening with his
      mantle off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you,' said Dumps, feeling particularly grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, my love,' said Kitterbell to his wife, 'it's time we were off. We're
      to meet the other godfather and the godmother at the church, uncle,-Mr.
      and Mrs. Wilson from over the way-uncommonly nice people. My love, are you
      well wrapped up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you sure you won't have another shawl?' inquired the anxious husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sweet,' returned the charming mother, accepting Dumps's proffered
      arm; and the little party entered the hackney-coach that was to take them
      to the church; Dumps amusing Mrs. Kitterbell by expatiating largely on the
      danger of measles, thrush, teeth-cutting, and other interesting diseases
      to which children are subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony (which occupied about five minutes) passed off without
      anything particular occurring. The clergyman had to dine some distance
      from town, and had two churchings, three christenings, and a funeral to
      perform in something less than an hour. The godfathers and godmother,
      therefore, promised to renounce the devil and all his works-'and all that
      sort of thing'-as little Kitterbell said-'in less than no time;' and with
      the exception of Dumps nearly letting the child fall into the font when he
      handed it to the clergyman, the whole affair went off in the usual
      business-like and matter-of-course manner, and Dumps re- entered the
      Bank-gates at two o'clock with a heavy heart, and the painful conviction
      that he was regularly booked for an evening party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening came-and so did Dumps's pumps, black silk stockings, and white
      cravat which he had ordered to be forwarded, per boy, from Pentonville.
      The depressed godfather dressed himself at a friend's counting-house, from
      whence, with his spirits fifty degrees below proof, he sallied forth-as
      the weather had cleared up, and the evening was tolerably fine-to walk to
      Great Russell-street. Slowly he paced up Cheapside, Newgate-street, down
      Snow-hill, and up Holborn ditto, looking as grim as the figure-head of a
      man-of-war, and finding out fresh causes of misery at every step. As he
      was crossing the corner of Hatton-garden, a man apparently intoxicated,
      rushed against him, and would have knocked him down, had he not been
      providentially caught by a very genteel young man, who happened to be
      close to him at the time. The shock so disarranged Dumps's nerves, as well
      as his dress, that he could hardly stand. The gentleman took his arm, and
      in the kindest manner walked with him as far as Furnival's Inn. Dumps, for
      about the first time in his life, felt grateful and polite; and he and the
      gentlemanly-looking young man parted with mutual expressions of good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There are at least some well-disposed men in the world,' ruminated the
      misanthropical Dumps, as he proceeded towards his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rat-tat-ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-rat-knocked a hackney-coachman at Kitterbell's
      door, in imitation of a gentleman's servant, just as Dumps reached it; and
      out came an old lady in a large toque, and an old gentleman in a blue
      coat, and three female copies of the old lady in pink dresses, and shoes
      to match.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's a large party,' sighed the unhappy godfather, wiping the
      perspiration from his forehead, and leaning against the area-railings. It
      was some time before the miserable man could muster up courage to knock at
      the door, and when he did, the smart appearance of a neighbouring
      greengrocer (who had been hired to wait for seven and sixpence, and whose
      calves alone were worth double the money), the lamp in the passage, and
      the Venus on the landing, added to the hum of many voices, and the sound
      of a harp and two violins, painfully convinced him that his surmises were
      but too well founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you?' said little Kitterbell, in a greater bustle than ever,
      bolting out of the little back parlour with a cork-screw in his hand, and
      various particles of sawdust, looking like so many inverted commas, on his
      inexpressibles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good God!' said Dumps, turning into the aforesaid parlour to put his
      shoes on, which he had brought in his coat-pocket, and still more appalled
      by the sight of seven fresh-drawn corks, and a corresponding number of
      decanters. 'How many people are there up-stairs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, not above thirty-five. We've had the carpet taken up in the back
      drawing-room, and the piano and the card-tables are in the front. Jemima
      thought we'd better have a regular sit-down supper in the front parlour,
      because of the speechifying, and all that. But, Lord! uncle, what's the
      matter?' continued the excited little man, as Dumps stood with one shoe
      on, rummaging his pockets with the most frightful distortion of visage.
      'What have you lost? Your pocket-book?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' returned Dumps, diving first into one pocket and then into the
      other, and speaking in a voice like Desdemona with the pillow over her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your card-case? snuff-box? the key of your lodgings?' continued
      Kitterbell, pouring question on question with the rapidity of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! no!' ejaculated Dumps, still diving eagerly into his empty pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not-not-the mug you spoke of this morning?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, the mug!' replied Dumps, sinking into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How could you have done it?' inquired Kitterbell. 'Are you sure you
      brought it out?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes! yes! I see it all!' said Dumps, starting up as the idea flashed
      across his mind; 'miserable dog that I am-I was born to suffer. I see it
      all: it was the gentlemanly-looking young man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Dumps!' shouted the greengrocer in a stentorian voice, as he ushered
      the somewhat recovered godfather into the drawing-room half an hour after
      the above declaration. 'Mr. Dumps!'-everybody looked at the door, and in
      came Dumps, feeling about as much out of place as a salmon might be
      supposed to be on a gravel-walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Happy to see you again,' said Mrs. Kitterbell, quite unconscious of the
      unfortunate man's confusion and misery; 'you must allow me to introduce
      you to a few of our friends:-my mamma, Mr. Dumps-my papa and sisters.'
      Dumps seized the hand of the mother as warmly as if she was his own
      parent, bowed to the young ladies, and against a gentleman behind him, and
      took no notice whatever of the father, who had been bowing incessantly for
      three minutes and a quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uncle,' said little Kitterbell, after Dumps had been introduced to a
      select dozen or two, 'you must let me lead you to the other end of the
      room, to introduce you to my friend Danton. Such a splendid fellow!-I'm
      sure you'll like him-this way,'-Dumps followed as tractably as a tame
      bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Danton was a young man of about five-and-twenty, with a considerable
      stock of impudence, and a very small share of ideas: he was a great
      favourite, especially with young ladies of from sixteen to twenty-six
      years of age, both inclusive. He could imitate the French-horn to
      admiration, sang comic songs most inimitably, and had the most insinuating
      way of saying impertinent nothings to his doting female admirers. He had
      acquired, somehow or other, the reputation of being a great wit, and,
      accordingly, whenever he opened his mouth, everybody who knew him laughed
      very heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction took place in due form. Mr. Danton bowed, and twirled a
      lady's handkerchief, which he held in his hand, in a most comic way.
      Everybody smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very warm,' said Dumps, feeling it necessary to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. It was warmer yesterday,' returned the brilliant Mr. Danton.-A
      general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have great pleasure in congratulating you on your first appearance in
      the character of a father, sir,' he continued, addressing
      Dumps-'godfather, I mean.'-The young ladies were convulsed, and the
      gentlemen in ecstasies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general hum of admiration interrupted the conversation, and announced
      the entrance of nurse with the baby. An universal rush of the young ladies
      immediately took place. (Girls are always so fond of babies in company.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you dear!' said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How sweet!' cried another, in a low tone of the most enthusiastic
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heavenly!' added a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! what dear little arms!' said a fourth, holding up an arm and fist
      about the size and shape of the leg of a fowl cleanly picked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you ever!'-said a little coquette with a large bustle, who looked
      like a French lithograph, appealing to a gentleman in three
      waistcoats-'Did you ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never, in my life,' returned her admirer, pulling up his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! do let me take it, nurse,' cried another young lady. 'The love!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can it open its eyes, nurse?' inquired another, affecting the utmost
      innocence.-Suffice it to say, that the single ladies unanimously voted him
      an angel, and that the married ones, nem. con., agreed that he was
      decidedly the finest baby they had ever beheld-except their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quadrilles were resumed with great spirit. Mr. Danton was universally
      admitted to be beyond himself; several young ladies enchanted the company
      and gained admirers by singing 'We met'-'I saw her at the Fancy Fair'-and
      other equally sentimental and interesting ballads. 'The young men,' as
      Mrs. Kitterbell said, 'made themselves very agreeable;' the girls did not
      lose their opportunity; and the evening promised to go off excellently.
      Dumps didn't mind it: he had devised a plan for himself-a little bit of
      fun in his own way-and he was almost happy! He played a rubber and lost
      every point Mr. Danton said he could not have lost every point, because he
      made a point of losing: everybody laughed tremendously. Dumps retorted
      with a better joke, and nobody smiled, with the exception of the host, who
      seemed to consider it his duty to laugh till he was black in the face, at
      everything. There was only one drawback-the musicians did not play with
      quite as much spirit as could have been wished. The cause, however, was
      satisfactorily explained; for it appeared, on the testimony of a gentleman
      who had come up from Gravesend in the afternoon, that they had been
      engaged on board a steamer all day, and had played almost without
      cessation all the way to Gravesend, and all the way back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'sit-down supper' was excellent; there were four barley-sugar temples
      on the table, which would have looked beautiful if they had not melted
      away when the supper began; and a water-mill, whose only fault was that
      instead of going round, it ran over the table-cloth. Then there were
      fowls, and tongue, and trifle, and sweets, and lobster salad, and potted
      beef-and everything. And little Kitterbell kept calling out for clean
      plates, and the clean plates did not come: and then the gentlemen who
      wanted the plates said they didn't mind, they'd take a lady's; and then
      Mrs. Kitterbell applauded their gallantry, and the greengrocer ran about
      till he thought his seven and sixpence was very hardly earned; and the
      young ladies didn't eat much for fear it shouldn't look romantic, and the
      married ladies eat as much as possible, for fear they shouldn't have
      enough; and a great deal of wine was drunk, and everybody talked and
      laughed considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush! hush!' said Mr. Kitterbell, rising and looking very important. 'My
      love (this was addressed to his wife at the other end of the table), take
      care of Mrs. Maxwell, and your mamma, and the rest of the married ladies;
      the gentlemen will persuade the young ladies to fill their glasses, I am
      sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ladies and gentlemen,' said long Dumps, in a very sepulchral voice and
      rueful accent, rising from his chair like the ghost in Don Juan, 'will you
      have the kindness to charge your glasses? I am desirous of proposing a
      toast.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence ensued, and the glasses were filled-everybody looked
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ladies and gentlemen,' slowly continued the ominous Dumps, 'I'-(here Mr.
      Danton imitated two notes from the French-horn, in a very loud key, which
      electrified the nervous toast-proposer, and convulsed his audience).
    </p>
    <p>
      'Order! order!' said little Kitterbell, endeavouring to suppress his
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Order!' said the gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Danton, be quiet,' said a particular friend on the opposite side of the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ladies and gentlemen,' resumed Dumps, somewhat recovered, and not much
      disconcerted, for he was always a pretty good hand at a speech-'In
      accordance with what is, I believe, the established usage on these
      occasions, I, as one of the godfathers of Master Frederick Charles William
      Kitterbell-(here the speaker's voice faltered, for he remembered the
      mug)-venture to rise to propose a toast. I need hardly say that it is the
      health and prosperity of that young gentleman, the particular event of
      whose early life we are here met to celebrate-(applause). Ladies and
      gentlemen, it is impossible to suppose that our friends here, whose
      sincere well-wishers we all are, can pass through life without some
      trials, considerable suffering, severe affliction, and heavy losses!'-Here
      the arch-traitor paused, and slowly drew forth a long, white
      pocket-handkerchief-his example was followed by several ladies. 'That
      these trials may be long spared them is my most earnest prayer, my most
      fervent wish (a distinct sob from the grandmother). I hope and trust,
      ladies and gentlemen, that the infant whose christening we have this
      evening met to celebrate, may not be removed from the arms of his parents
      by premature decay (several cambrics were in requisition): that his young
      and now apparently healthy form, may not be wasted by lingering disease.
      (Here Dumps cast a sardonic glance around, for a great sensation was
      manifest among the married ladies.) You, I am sure, will concur with me in
      wishing that he may live to be a comfort and a blessing to his parents.
      ("Hear, hear!" and an audible sob from Mr. Kitterbell.) But should he not
      be what we could wish-should he forget in after times the duty which he
      owes to them-should they unhappily experience that distracting truth, "how
      sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child"'-Here Mrs.
      Kitterbell, with her handkerchief to her eyes, and accompanied by several
      ladies, rushed from the room, and went into violent hysterics in the
      passage, leaving her better half in almost as bad a condition, and a
      general impression in Dumps's favour; for people like sentiment, after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need hardly be added, that this occurrence quite put a stop to the
      harmony of the evening. Vinegar, hartshorn, and cold water, were now as
      much in request as negus, rout-cakes, and bon-bons had been a short time
      before. Mrs. Kitterbell was immediately conveyed to her apartment, the
      musicians were silenced, flirting ceased, and the company slowly departed.
      Dumps left the house at the commencement of the bustle, and walked home
      with a light step, and (for him) a cheerful heart. His landlady, who slept
      in the next room, has offered to make oath that she heard him laugh, in
      his peculiar manner, after he had locked his door. The assertion, however,
      is so improbable, and bears on the face of it such strong evidence of
      untruth, that it has never obtained credence to this hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family of Mr. Kitterbell has considerably increased since the period
      to which we have referred; he has now two sons and a daughter; and as he
      expects, at no distant period, to have another addition to his blooming
      progeny, he is anxious to secure an eligible godfather for the occasion.
      He is determined, however, to impose upon him two conditions. He must bind
      himself, by a solemn obligation, not to make any speech after supper; and
      it is indispensable that he should be in no way connected with 'the most
      miserable man in the world.'

      CHAPTER XII-THE DRUNKARD'S DEATH
    </h2>
    <p>
      We will be bold to say, that there is scarcely a man in the constant habit
      of walking, day after day, through any of the crowded thoroughfares of
      London, who cannot recollect among the people whom he 'knows by sight,' to
      use a familiar phrase, some being of abject and wretched appearance whom
      he remembers to have seen in a very different condition, whom he has
      observed sinking lower and lower, by almost imperceptible degrees, and the
      shabbiness and utter destitution of whose appearance, at last, strike
      forcibly and painfully upon him, as he passes by. Is there any man who has
      mixed much with society, or whose avocations have caused him to mingle, at
      one time or other, with a great number of people, who cannot call to mind
      the time when some shabby, miserable wretch, in rags and filth, who
      shuffles past him now in all the squalor of disease and poverty, with a
      respectable tradesman, or clerk, or a man following some thriving pursuit,
      with good prospects, and decent means?-or cannot any of our readers call
      to mind from among the list of their quondam acquaintance, some fallen and
      degraded man, who lingers about the pavement in hungry misery-from whom
      every one turns coldly away, and who preserves himself from sheer
      starvation, nobody knows how? Alas! such cases are of too frequent
      occurrence to be rare items in any man's experience; and but too often
      arise from one cause-drunkenness-that fierce rage for the slow, sure
      poison, that oversteps every other consideration; that casts aside wife,
      children, friends, happiness, and station; and hurries its victims madly
      on to degradation and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these men have been impelled, by misfortune and misery, to the
      vice that has degraded them. The ruin of worldly expectations, the death
      of those they loved, the sorrow that slowly consumes, but will not break
      the heart, has driven them wild; and they present the hideous spectacle of
      madmen, slowly dying by their own hands. But by far the greater part have
      wilfully, and with open eyes, plunged into the gulf from which the man who
      once enters it never rises more, but into which he sinks deeper and deeper
      down, until recovery is hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a man as this once stood by the bedside of his dying wife, while his
      children knelt around, and mingled loud bursts of grief with their
      innocent prayers. The room was scantily and meanly furnished; and it
      needed but a glance at the pale form from which the light of life was fast
      passing away, to know that grief, and want, and anxious care, had been
      busy at the heart for many a weary year. An elderly woman, with her face
      bathed in tears, was supporting the head of the dying woman-her
      daughter-on her arm. But it was not towards her that the was face turned;
      it was not her hand that the cold and trembling fingers clasped; they
      pressed the husband's arm; the eyes so soon to be closed in death rested
      on his face, and the man shook beneath their gaze. His dress was slovenly
      and disordered, his face inflamed, his eyes bloodshot and heavy. He had
      been summoned from some wild debauch to the bed of sorrow and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shaded lamp by the bed-side cast a dim light on the figures around, and
      left the remainder of the room in thick, deep shadow. The silence of night
      prevailed without the house, and the stillness of death was in the
      chamber. A watch hung over the mantel-shelf; its low ticking was the only
      sound that broke the profound quiet, but it was a solemn one, for well
      they knew, who heard it, that before it had recorded the passing of
      another hour, it would beat the knell of a departed spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a dreadful thing to wait and watch for the approach of death; to
      know that hope is gone, and recovery impossible; and to sit and count the
      dreary hours through long, long nights-such nights as only watchers by the
      bed of sickness know. It chills the blood to hear the dearest secrets of
      the heart-the pent-up, hidden secrets of many years-poured forth by the
      unconscious, helpless being before you; and to think how little the
      reserve and cunning of a whole life will avail, when fever and delirium
      tear off the mask at last. Strange tales have been told in the wanderings
      of dying men; tales so full of guilt and crime, that those who stood by
      the sick person's couch have fled in horror and affright, lest they should
      be scared to madness by what they heard and saw; and many a wretch has
      died alone, raving of deeds the very name of which has driven the boldest
      man away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no such ravings were to be heard at the bed-side by which the children
      knelt. Their half-stifled sobs and moaning alone broke the silence of the
      lonely chamber. And when at last the mother's grasp relaxed, and, turning
      one look from the children to the father, she vainly strove to speak, and
      fell backward on the pillow, all was so calm and tranquil that she seemed
      to sink to sleep. They leant over her; they called upon her name, softly
      at first, and then in the loud and piercing tones of desperation. But
      there was no reply. They listened for her breath, but no sound came. They
      felt for the palpitation of the heart, but no faint throb responded to the
      touch. That heart was broken, and she was dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband sunk into a chair by the bed-side, and clasped his hands upon
      his burning forehead. He gazed from child to child, but when a weeping eye
      met his, he quailed beneath its look. No word of comfort was whispered in
      his ear, no look of kindness lighted on his face. All shrunk from and
      avoided him; and when at last he staggered from the room, no one sought to
      follow or console the widower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had been when many a friend would have crowded round him in his
      affliction, and many a heartfelt condolence would have met him in his
      grief. Where were they now? One by one, friends, relations, the commonest
      acquaintance even, had fallen off from and deserted the drunkard. His wife
      alone had clung to him in good and evil, in sickness and poverty, and how
      had he rewarded her? He had reeled from the tavern to her bed-side in time
      to see her die.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed from the house, and walked swiftly through the streets. Remorse,
      fear, shame, all crowded on his mind. Stupefied with drink, and bewildered
      with the scene he had just witnessed, he re-entered the tavern he had
      quitted shortly before. Glass succeeded glass. His blood mounted, and his
      brain whirled round. Death! Every one must die, and why not she? She was
      too good for him; her relations had often told him so. Curses on them! Had
      they not deserted her, and left her to whine away the time at home?
      Well-she was dead, and happy perhaps. It was better as it was. Another
      glass-one more! Hurrah! It was a merry life while it lasted; and he would
      make the most of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went on; the three children who were left to him, grew up, and were
      children no longer. The father remained the same-poorer, shabbier, and
      more dissolute-looking, but the same confirmed and irreclaimable drunkard.
      The boys had, long ago, run wild in the streets, and left him; the girl
      alone remained, but she worked hard, and words or blows could always
      procure him something for the tavern. So he went on in the old course, and
      a merry life he led.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, as early as ten o'clock-for the girl had been sick for many
      days, and there was, consequently, little to spend at the public- house-he
      bent his steps homeward, bethinking himself that if he would have her able
      to earn money, it would be as well to apply to the parish surgeon, or, at
      all events, to take the trouble of inquiring what ailed her, which he had
      not yet thought it worth while to do. It was a wet December night; the
      wind blew piercing cold, and the rain poured heavily down. He begged a few
      halfpence from a passer-by, and having bought a small loaf (for it was his
      interest to keep the girl alive, if he could), he shuffled onwards as fast
      as the wind and rain would let him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of Fleet-street, and lying between it and the water-side, are
      several mean and narrow courts, which form a portion of Whitefriars: it
      was to one of these that he directed his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alley into which he turned, might, for filth and misery, have competed
      with the darkest corner of this ancient sanctuary in its dirtiest and most
      lawless time. The houses, varying from two stories in height to four, were
      stained with every indescribable hue that long exposure to the weather,
      damp, and rottenness can impart to tenements composed originally of the
      roughest and coarsest materials. The windows were patched with paper, and
      stuffed with the foulest rags; the doors were falling from their hinges;
      poles with lines on which to dry clothes, projected from every casement,
      and sounds of quarrelling or drunkenness issued from every room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitary oil lamp in the centre of the court had been blown out,
      either by the violence of the wind or the act of some inhabitant who had
      excellent reasons for objecting to his residence being rendered too
      conspicuous; and the only light which fell upon the broken and uneven
      pavement, was derived from the miserable candles that here and there
      twinkled in the rooms of such of the more fortunate residents as could
      afford to indulge in so expensive a luxury. A gutter ran down the centre
      of the alley-all the sluggish odours of which had been called forth by the
      rain; and as the wind whistled through the old houses, the doors and
      shutters creaked upon their hinges, and the windows shook in their frames,
      with a violence which every moment seemed to threaten the destruction of
      the whole place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man whom we have followed into this den, walked on in the darkness,
      sometimes stumbling into the main gutter, and at others into some branch
      repositories of garbage which had been formed by the rain, until he
      reached the last house in the court. The door, or rather what was left of
      it, stood ajar, for the convenience of the numerous lodgers; and he
      proceeded to grope his way up the old and broken stair, to the attic
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was within a step or two of his room door, when it opened, and a girl,
      whose miserable and emaciated appearance was only to be equalled by that
      of the candle which she shaded with her hand, peeped anxiously out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that you, father?' said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who else should it be?' replied the man gruffly. 'What are you trembling
      at? It's little enough that I've had to drink to-day, for there's no drink
      without money, and no money without work. What the devil's the matter with
      the girl?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not well, father-not at all well,' said the girl, bursting into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' replied the man, in the tone of a person who is compelled to admit a
      very unpleasant fact, to which he would rather remain blind, if he could.
      'You must get better somehow, for we must have money. You must go to the
      parish doctor, and make him give you some medicine. They're paid for it,
      damn 'em. What are you standing before the door for? Let me come in, can't
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Father,' whispered the girl, shutting the door behind her, and placing
      herself before it, 'William has come back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who!' said the man with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush,' replied the girl, 'William; brother William.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what does he want?' said the man, with an effort at composure-'money?
      meat? drink? He's come to the wrong shop for that, if he does. Give me the
      candle-give me the candle, fool-I ain't going to hurt him.' He snatched
      the candle from her hand, and walked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on an old box, with his head resting on his hand, and his eyes
      fixed on a wretched cinder fire that was smouldering on the hearth, was a
      young man of about two-and-twenty, miserably clad in an old coarse jacket
      and trousers. He started up when his father entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fasten the door, Mary,' said the young man hastily-'Fasten the door. You
      look as if you didn't know me, father. It's long enough, since you drove
      me from home; you may well forget me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what do you want here, now?' said the father, seating himself on a
      stool, on the other side of the fireplace. 'What do you want here, now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shelter,' replied the son. 'I'm in trouble: that's enough. If I'm caught
      I shall swing; that's certain. Caught I shall be, unless I stop here;
      that's as certain. And there's an end of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean to say, you've been robbing, or murdering, then?' said the
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I do,' replied the son. 'Does it surprise you, father?' He looked
      steadily in the man's face, but he withdrew his eyes, and bent them on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where's your brothers?' he said, after a long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where they'll never trouble you,' replied his son: 'John's gone to
      America, and Henry's dead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dead!' said the father, with a shudder, which even he could not express.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dead,' replied the young man. 'He died in my arms-shot like a dog, by a
      gamekeeper. He staggered back, I caught him, and his blood trickled down
      my hands. It poured out from his side like water. He was weak, and it
      blinded him, but he threw himself down on his knees, on the grass, and
      prayed to God, that if his mother was in heaven, He would hear her prayers
      for pardon for her youngest son. "I was her favourite boy, Will," he said,
      "and I am glad to think, now, that when she was dying, though I was a very
      young child then, and my little heart was almost bursting, I knelt down at
      the foot of the bed, and thanked God for having made me so fond of her as
      to have never once done anything to bring the tears into her eyes. O Will,
      why was she taken away, and father left?" There's his dying words,
      father,' said the young man; 'make the best you can of 'em. You struck him
      across the face, in a drunken fit, the morning we ran away; and here's the
      end of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl wept aloud; and the father, sinking his head upon his knees,
      rocked himself to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I am taken,' said the young man, 'I shall be carried back into the
      country, and hung for that man's murder. They cannot trace me here,
      without your assistance, father. For aught I know, you may give me up to
      justice; but unless you do, here I stop, until I can venture to escape
      abroad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      For two whole days, all three remained in the wretched room, without
      stirring out. On the third evening, however, the girl was worse than she
      had been yet, and the few scraps of food they had were gone. It was
      indispensably necessary that somebody should go out; and as the girl was
      too weak and ill, the father went, just at nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got some medicine for the girl, and a trifle in the way of pecuniary
      assistance. On his way back, he earned sixpence by holding a horse; and he
      turned homewards with enough money to supply their most pressing wants for
      two or three days to come. He had to pass the public-house. He lingered
      for an instant, walked past it, turned back again, lingered once more, and
      finally slunk in. Two men whom he had not observed, were on the watch.
      They were on the point of giving up their search in despair, when his
      loitering attracted their attention; and when he entered the public-house,
      they followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll drink with me, master,' said one of them, proffering him a glass
      of liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And me too,' said the other, replenishing the glass as soon as it was
      drained of its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man thought of his hungry children, and his son's danger. But they
      were nothing to the drunkard. He did drink; and his reason left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A wet night, Warden,' whispered one of the men in his ear, as he at
      length turned to go away, after spending in liquor one-half of the money
      on which, perhaps, his daughter's life depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The right sort of night for our friends in hiding, Master Warden,'
      whispered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit down here,' said the one who had spoken first, drawing him into a
      corner. 'We have been looking arter the young un. We came to tell him,
      it's all right now, but we couldn't find him 'cause we hadn't got the
      precise direction. But that ain't strange, for I don't think he know'd it
      himself, when he come to London, did he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, he didn't,' replied the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a vessel down at the docks, to sail at midnight, when it's high
      water,' resumed the first speaker, 'and we'll put him on board. His
      passage is taken in another name, and what's better than that, it's paid
      for. It's lucky we met you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very,' said the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital luck,' said the first, with a wink to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great,' replied the second, with a slight nod of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Another glass here; quick'-said the first speaker. And in five minutes
      more, the father had unconsciously yielded up his own son into the
      hangman's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and heavily the time dragged along, as the brother and sister, in
      their miserable hiding-place, listened in anxious suspense to the
      slightest sound. At length, a heavy footstep was heard upon the stair; it
      approached nearer; it reached the landing; and the father staggered into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl saw that he was intoxicated, and advanced with the candle in her
      hand to meet him; she stopped short, gave a loud scream, and fell
      senseless on the ground. She had caught sight of the shadow of a man
      reflected on the floor. They both rushed in, and in another instant the
      young man was a prisoner, and handcuffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very quietly done,' said one of the men to his companion, 'thanks to the
      old man. Lift up the girl, Tom-come, come, it's no use crying, young
      woman. It's all over now, and can't be helped.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stooped for an instant over the girl, and then turned
      fiercely round upon his father, who had reeled against the wall, and was
      gazing on the group with drunken stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Listen to me, father,' he said, in a tone that made the drunkard's flesh
      creep. 'My brother's blood, and mine, is on your head: I never had kind
      look, or word, or care, from you, and alive or dead, I never will forgive
      you. Die when you will, or how, I will be with you. I speak as a dead man
      now, and I warn you, father, that as surely as you must one day stand
      before your Maker, so surely shall your children be there, hand in hand,
      to cry for judgment against you.' He raised his manacled hands in a
      threatening attitude, fixed his eyes on his shrinking parent, and slowly
      left the room; and neither father nor sister ever beheld him more, on this
      side of the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dim and misty light of a winter's morning penetrated into the
      narrow court, and struggled through the begrimed window of the wretched
      room, Warden awoke from his heavy sleep, and found himself alone. He rose,
      and looked round him; the old flock mattress on the floor was undisturbed;
      everything was just as he remembered to have seen it last: and there were
      no signs of any one, save himself, having occupied the room during the
      night. He inquired of the other lodgers, and of the neighbours; but his
      daughter had not been seen or heard of. He rambled through the streets,
      and scrutinised each wretched face among the crowds that thronged them,
      with anxious eyes. But his search was fruitless, and he returned to his
      garret when night came on, desolate and weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many days he occupied himself in the same manner, but no trace of his
      daughter did he meet with, and no word of her reached his ears. At length
      he gave up the pursuit as hopeless. He had long thought of the probability
      of her leaving him, and endeavouring to gain her bread in quiet,
      elsewhere. She had left him at last to starve alone. He ground his teeth,
      and cursed her!
    </p>
    <p>
      He begged his bread from door to door. Every halfpenny he could wring from
      the pity or credulity of those to whom he addressed himself, was spent in
      the old way. A year passed over his head; the roof of a jail was the only
      one that had sheltered him for many months. He slept under archways, and
      in brickfields-anywhere, where there was some warmth or shelter from the
      cold and rain. But in the last stage of poverty, disease, and houseless
      want, he was a drunkard still.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one bitter night, he sunk down on a door-step faint and ill. The
      premature decay of vice and profligacy had worn him to the bone. His
      cheeks were hollow and livid; his eyes were sunken, and their sight was
      dim. His legs trembled beneath his weight, and a cold shiver ran through
      every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the long-forgotten scenes of a misspent life crowded thick and
      fast upon him. He thought of the time when he had a home-a happy, cheerful
      home-and of those who peopled it, and flocked about him then, until the
      forms of his elder children seemed to rise from the grave, and stand about
      him-so plain, so clear, and so distinct they were that he could touch and
      feel them. Looks that he had long forgotten were fixed upon him once more;
      voices long since hushed in death sounded in his ears like the music of
      village bells. But it was only for an instant. The rain beat heavily upon
      him; and cold and hunger were gnawing at his heart again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and dragged his feeble limbs a few paces further. The street was
      silent and empty; the few passengers who passed by, at that late hour,
      hurried quickly on, and his tremulous voice was lost in the violence of
      the storm. Again that heavy chill struck through his frame, and his blood
      seemed to stagnate beneath it. He coiled himself up in a projecting
      doorway, and tried to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sleep had fled from his dull and glazed eyes. His mind wandered
      strangely, but he was awake, and conscious. The well-known shout of
      drunken mirth sounded in his ear, the glass was at his lips, the board was
      covered with choice rich food-they were before him: he could see them all,
      he had but to reach out his hand, and take them-and, though the illusion
      was reality itself, he knew that he was sitting alone in the deserted
      street, watching the rain-drops as they pattered on the stones; that death
      was coming upon him by inches-and that there were none to care for or help
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he started up, in the extremity of terror. He had heard his own
      voice shouting in the night air, he knew not what, or why. Hark! A
      groan!-another! His senses were leaving him: half-formed and incoherent
      words burst from his lips; and his hands sought to tear and lacerate his
      flesh. He was going mad, and he shrieked for help till his voice failed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head, and looked up the long dismal street. He recollected
      that outcasts like himself, condemned to wander day and night in those
      dreadful streets, had sometimes gone distracted with their own loneliness.
      He remembered to have heard many years before that a homeless wretch had
      once been found in a solitary corner, sharpening a rusty knife to plunge
      into his own heart, preferring death to that endless, weary, wandering to
      and fro. In an instant his resolve was taken, his limbs received new life;
      he ran quickly from the spot, and paused not for breath until he reached
      the river-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crept softly down the steep stone stairs that lead from the
      commencement of Waterloo Bridge, down to the water's level. He crouched
      into a corner, and held his breath, as the patrol passed. Never did
      prisoner's heart throb with the hope of liberty and life half so eagerly
      as did that of the wretched man at the prospect of death. The watch passed
      close to him, but he remained unobserved; and after waiting till the sound
      of footsteps had died away in the distance, he cautiously descended, and
      stood beneath the gloomy arch that forms the landing- place from the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide was in, and the water flowed at his feet. The rain had ceased,
      the wind was lulled, and all was, for the moment, still and quiet-so
      quiet, that the slightest sound on the opposite bank, even the rippling of
      the water against the barges that were moored there, was distinctly
      audible to his ear. The stream stole languidly and sluggishly on. Strange
      and fantastic forms rose to the surface, and beckoned him to approach;
      dark gleaming eyes peered from the water, and seemed to mock his
      hesitation, while hollow murmurs from behind, urged him onwards. He
      retreated a few paces, took a short run, desperate leap, and plunged into
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not five seconds had passed when he rose to the water's surface-but what a
      change had taken place in that short time, in all his thoughts and
      feelings! Life-life in any form, poverty, misery, starvation-anything but
      death. He fought and struggled with the water that closed over his head,
      and screamed in agonies of terror. The curse of his own son rang in his
      ears. The shore-but one foot of dry ground-he could almost touch the step.
      One hand's breadth nearer, and he was saved-but the tide bore him onward,
      under the dark arches of the bridge, and he sank to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he rose, and struggled for life. For one instant-for one brief
      instant-the buildings on the river's banks, the lights on the bridge
      through which the current had borne him, the black water, and the fast-
      flying clouds, were distinctly visible-once more he sunk, and once again
      he rose. Bright flames of fire shot up from earth to heaven, and reeled
      before his eyes, while the water thundered in his ears, and stunned him
      with its furious roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week afterwards the body was washed ashore, some miles down the river, a
      swollen and disfigured mass. Unrecognised and unpitied, it was borne to
      the grave; and there it has long since mouldered away! SKETCHES OF YOUNG

      LADIES resident in the isles of guernsey, jersey, alderney, and sark, the
      humble dedication of their devoted admirer,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheweth,-
    </p>
    <p>
      That your Dedicator has perused, with feelings of virtuous indignation, a
      work purporting to be 'Sketches of Young Ladies;' written by Quiz,
      illustrated by Phiz, and published in one volume, square twelvemo.
    </p>
    <p>
      That after an attentive and vigilant perusal of the said work, your
      Dedicator is humbly of opinion that so many libels, upon your Honourable
      sex, were never contained in any previously published work, in twelvemo or
      any other mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      That in the title page and preface to the said work, your Honourable sex
      are described and classified as animals; and although your Dedicator is
      not at present prepared to deny that you are animals, still he humbly
      submits that it is not polite to call you so.
    </p>
    <p>
      That in the aforesaid preface, your Honourable sex are also described as
      Troglodites, which, being a hard word, may, for aught your Honourable sex
      or your Dedicator can say to the contrary, be an injurious and
      disrespectful appellation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the author of the said work applied himself to his task in malice
      prepense and with wickedness aforethought; a fact which, your Dedicator
      contends, is sufficiently demonstrated, by his assuming the name of Quiz,
      which, your Dedicator submits, denotes a foregone conclusion, and implies
      an intention of quizzing.
    </p>
    <p>
      That in the execution of his evil design, the said Quiz, or author of the
      said work, must have betrayed some trust or confidence reposed in him by
      some members of your Honourable sex, otherwise he never could have
      acquired so much information relative to the manners and customs of your
      Honourable sex in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      That actuated by these considerations, and further moved by various
      slanders and insinuations respecting your Honourable sex contained in the
      said work, square twelvemo, entitled 'Sketches of Young Ladies,' your
      Dedicator ventures to produce another work, square twelvemo, entitled
      'Sketches of Young Gentlemen,' of which he now solicits your acceptance
      and approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      That as the Young Ladies are the best companions of the Young Gentlemen,
      so the Young Gentlemen should be the best companions of the Young Ladies;
      and extending the comparison from animals (to quote the disrespectful
      language of the said Quiz) to inanimate objects, your Dedicator humbly
      suggests, that such of your Honourable sex as purchased the bane should
      possess themselves of the antidote, and that those of your Honourable sex
      who were not rash enough to take the first, should lose no time in
      swallowing the last,-prevention being in all cases better than cure, as we
      are informed upon the authority, not only of general acknowledgment, but
      also of traditionary wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      That with reference to the said bane and antidote, your Dedicator has no
      further remarks to make, than are comprised in the printed directions
      issued with Doctor Morison's pills; namely, that whenever your Honourable
      sex take twenty-five of Number, 1, you will be pleased to take fifty of
      Number 2, without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      And your Dedicator shall ever pray, &amp;c. THE BASHFUL YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      We found ourself seated at a small dinner party the other day, opposite a
      stranger of such singular appearance and manner, that he irresistibly
      attracted our attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a fresh-coloured young gentleman, with as good a promise of light
      whisker as one might wish to see, and possessed of a very velvet- like,
      soft-looking countenance. We do not use the latter term invidiously, but
      merely to denote a pair of smooth, plump, highly- coloured cheeks of
      capacious dimensions, and a mouth rather remarkable for the fresh hue of
      the lips than for any marked or striking expression it presented. His
      whole face was suffused with a crimson blush, and bore that downcast,
      timid, retiring look, which betokens a man ill at ease with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in these symptoms to attract more than a passing remark,
      but our attention had been originally drawn to the bashful young
      gentleman, on his first appearance in the drawing-room above-stairs, into
      which he was no sooner introduced, than making his way towards us who were
      standing in a window, and wholly neglecting several persons who warmly
      accosted him, he seized our hand with visible emotion, and pressed it with
      a convulsive grasp for a good couple of minutes, after which he dived in a
      nervous manner across the room, oversetting in his way a fine little girl
      of six years and a quarter old-and shrouding himself behind some hangings,
      was seen no more, until the eagle eye of the hostess detecting him in his
      concealment, on the announcement of dinner, he was requested to pair off
      with a lively single lady, of two or three and thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This most flattering salutation from a perfect stranger, would have
      gratified us not a little as a token of his having held us in high
      respect, and for that reason been desirous of our acquaintance, if we had
      not suspected from the first, that the young gentleman, in making a
      desperate effort to get through the ceremony of introduction, had, in the
      bewilderment of his ideas, shaken hands with us at random. This impression
      was fully confirmed by the subsequent behaviour of the bashful young
      gentleman in question, which we noted particularly, with the view of
      ascertaining whether we were right in our conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman seated himself at table with evident misgivings, and
      turning sharp round to pay attention to some observation of his loquacious
      neighbour, overset his bread. There was nothing very bad in this, and if
      he had had the presence of mind to let it go, and say nothing about it,
      nobody but the man who had laid the cloth would have been a bit the wiser;
      but the young gentleman in various semi-successful attempts to prevent its
      fall, played with it a little, as gentlemen in the streets may be seen to
      do with their hats on a windy day, and then giving the roll a smart rap in
      his anxiety to catch it, knocked it with great adroitness into a tureen of
      white soup at some distance, to the unspeakable terror and disturbance of
      a very amiable bald gentleman, who was dispensing the contents. We thought
      the bashful young gentleman would have gone off in an apoplectic fit,
      consequent upon the violent rush of blood to his face at the occurrence of
      this catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this moment we perceived, in the phraseology of the fancy, that it
      was 'all up' with the bashful young gentleman, and so indeed it was.
      Several benevolent persons endeavoured to relieve his embarrassment by
      taking wine with him, but finding that it only augmented his sufferings,
      and that after mingling sherry, champagne, hock, and moselle together, he
      applied the greater part of the mixture externally, instead of internally,
      they gradually dropped off, and left him to the exclusive care of the
      talkative lady, who, not noting the wildness of his eye, firmly believed
      she had secured a listener. He broke a glass or two in the course of the
      meal, and disappeared shortly afterwards; it is inferred that he went away
      in some confusion, inasmuch as he left the house in another gentleman's
      coat, and the footman's hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little incident led us to reflect upon the most prominent
      characteristics of bashful young gentlemen in the abstract; and as this
      portable volume will be the great text-book of young ladies in all future
      generations, we record them here for their guidance and behoof.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bashful young gentleman, in turning a street corner, chance to
      stumble suddenly upon two or three young ladies of his acquaintance,
      nothing can exceed his confusion and agitation. His first impulse is to
      make a great variety of bows, and dart past them, which he does until,
      observing that they wish to stop, but are uncertain whether to do so or
      not, he makes several feints of returning, which causes them to do the
      same; and at length, after a great quantity of unnecessary dodging and
      falling up against the other passengers, he returns and shakes hands most
      affectionately with all of them, in doing which he knocks out of their
      grasp sundry little parcels, which he hastily picks up, and returns very
      muddy and disordered. The chances are that the bashful young gentleman
      then observes it is very fine weather, and being reminded that it has only
      just left off raining for the first time these three days, he blushes very
      much, and smiles as if he had said a very good thing. The young lady who
      was most anxious to speak, here inquires, with an air of great
      commiseration, how his dear sister Harriet is to-day; to which the young
      gentleman, without the slightest consideration, replies with many thanks,
      that she is remarkably well. 'Well, Mr. Hopkins!' cries the young lady,
      'why, we heard she was bled yesterday evening, and have been perfectly
      miserable about her.' 'Oh, ah,' says the young gentleman, 'so she was. Oh,
      she's very ill, very ill indeed.' The young gentleman then shakes his
      head, and looks very desponding (he has been smiling perpetually up to
      this time), and after a short pause, gives his glove a great wrench at the
      wrist, and says, with a strong emphasis on the adjective, 'Good morning,
      good morning.' And making a great number of bows in acknowledgment of
      several little messages to his sister, walks backward a few paces, and
      comes with great violence against a lamp-post, knocking his hat off in the
      contact, which in his mental confusion and bodily pain he is going to walk
      away without, until a great roar from a carter attracts his attention,
      when he picks it up, and tries to smile cheerfully to the young ladies,
      who are looking back, and who, he has the satisfaction of seeing, are all
      laughing heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quadrille party, the bashful young gentleman always remains as near
      the entrance of the room as possible, from which position he smiles at the
      people he knows as they come in, and sometimes steps forward to shake
      hands with more intimate friends: a process which on each repetition seems
      to turn him a deeper scarlet than before. He declines dancing the first
      set or two, observing, in a faint voice, that he would rather wait a
      little; but at length is absolutely compelled to allow himself to be
      introduced to a partner, when he is led, in a great heat and blushing
      furiously, across the room to a spot where half-a-dozen unknown ladies are
      congregated together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Lambert, let me introduce Mr. Hopkins for the next quadrille.' Miss
      Lambert inclines her head graciously. Mr. Hopkins bows, and his fair
      conductress disappears, leaving Mr. Hopkins, as he too well knows, to make
      himself agreeable. The young lady more than half expects that the bashful
      young gentleman will say something, and the bashful young gentleman
      feeling this, seriously thinks whether he has got anything to say, which,
      upon mature reflection, he is rather disposed to conclude he has not,
      since nothing occurs to him. Meanwhile, the young lady, after several
      inspections of her bouquet, all made in the expectation that the bashful
      young gentleman is going to talk, whispers her mamma, who is sitting next
      her, which whisper the bashful young gentleman immediately suspects (and
      possibly with very good reason) must be about him. In this comfortable
      condition he remains until it is time to 'stand up,' when murmuring a
      'Will you allow me?' he gives the young lady his arm, and after inquiring
      where she will stand, and receiving a reply that she has no choice,
      conducts her to the remotest corner of the quadrille, and making one
      attempt at conversation, which turns out a desperate failure, preserves a
      profound silence until it is all over, when he walks her twice round the
      room, deposits her in her old seat, and retires in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A married bashful gentleman-for these bashful gentlemen do get married
      sometimes; how it is ever brought about, is a mystery to us-a married
      bashful gentleman either causes his wife to appear bold by contrast, or
      merges her proper importance in his own insignificance. Bashful young
      gentlemen should be cured, or avoided. They are never hopeless, and never
      will be, while female beauty and attractions retain their influence, as
      any young lady will find, who may think it worth while on this confident
      assurance to take a patient in hand. THE OUT-AND-OUT YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Out-and-out young gentlemen may be divided into two classes-those who have
      something to do, and those who have nothing. I shall commence with the
      former, because that species come more frequently under the notice of
      young ladies, whom it is our province to warn and to instruct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The out-and-out young gentleman is usually no great dresser, his
      instructions to his tailor being all comprehended in the one general
      direction to 'make that what's-a-name a regular bang-up sort of thing.'
      For some years past, the favourite costume of the out-and-out young
      gentleman has been a rough pilot coat, with two gilt hooks and eyes to the
      velvet collar; buttons somewhat larger than crown-pieces; a black or fancy
      neckerchief, loosely tied; a wide-brimmed hat, with a low crown; tightish
      inexpressibles, and iron-shod boots. Out of doors he sometimes carries a
      large ash stick, but only on special occasions, for he prefers keeping his
      hands in his coat pockets. He smokes at all hours, of course, and swears
      considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The out-and-out young gentleman is employed in a city counting-house or
      solicitor's office, in which he does as little as he possibly can: his
      chief places of resort are, the streets, the taverns, and the theatres. In
      the streets at evening time, out-and-out young gentlemen have a pleasant
      custom of walking six or eight abreast, thus driving females and other
      inoffensive persons into the road, which never fails to afford them the
      highest satisfaction, especially if there be any immediate danger of their
      being run over, which enhances the fun of the thing materially. In all
      places of public resort, the out-and-outers are careful to select each a
      seat to himself, upon which he lies at full length, and (if the weather be
      very dirty, but not in any other case) he lies with his knees up, and the
      soles of his boots planted firmly on the cushion, so that if any low
      fellow should ask him to make room for a lady, he takes ample revenge upon
      her dress, without going at all out of his way to do it. He always sits
      with his hat on, and flourishes his stick in the air while the play is
      proceeding, with a dignified contempt of the performance; if it be
      possible for one or two out-and-out young gentlemen to get up a little
      crowding in the passages, they are quite in their element, squeezing,
      pushing, whooping, and shouting in the most humorous manner possible. If
      they can only succeed in irritating the gentleman who has a family of
      daughters under his charge, they are like to die with laughing, and boast
      of it among their companions for a week afterwards, adding, that one or
      two of them were 'devilish fine girls,' and that they really thought the
      youngest would have fainted, which was the only thing wanted to render the
      joke complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the out-and-out young gentleman have a mother and sisters, of course he
      treats them with becoming contempt, inasmuch as they (poor things!) having
      no notion of life or gaiety, are far too weak-spirited and moping for him.
      Sometimes, however, on a birth-day or at Christmas-time, he cannot very
      well help accompanying them to a party at some old friend's, with which
      view he comes home when they have been dressed an hour or two, smelling
      very strongly of tobacco and spirits, and after exchanging his rough coat
      for some more suitable attire (in which however he loses nothing of the
      out-and-outer), gets into the coach and grumbles all the way at his own
      good nature: his bitter reflections aggravated by the recollection, that
      Tom Smith has taken the chair at a little impromptu dinner at a fighting
      man's, and that a set-to was to take place on a dining-table, between the
      fighting man and his brother-in-law, which is probably 'coming off' at
      that very instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the out-and-out young gentleman is by no means at his ease in ladies'
      society, he shrinks into a corner of the drawing-room when they reach the
      friend's, and unless one of his sisters is kind enough to talk to him,
      remains there without being much troubled by the attentions of other
      people, until he espies, lingering outside the door, another gentleman,
      whom he at once knows, by his air and manner (for there is a kind of
      free-masonry in the craft), to be a brother out-and-outer, and towards
      whom he accordingly makes his way. Conversation being soon opened by some
      casual remark, the second out-and-outer confidentially informs the first,
      that he is one of the rough sort and hates that kind of thing, only he
      couldn't very well be off coming; to which the other replies, that that's
      just his case-'and I'll tell you what,' continues the out-and-outer in a
      whisper, 'I should like a glass of warm brandy and water just now,'-'Or a
      pint of stout and a pipe,' suggests the other out-and-outer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery is at once made that they are sympathetic souls; each of
      them says at the same moment, that he sees the other understands what's
      what: and they become fast friends at once, more especially when it
      appears, that the second out-and-outer is no other than a gentleman, long
      favourably known to his familiars as 'Mr. Warmint Blake,' who upon divers
      occasions has distinguished himself in a manner that would not have
      disgraced the fighting man, and who-having been a pretty long time about
      town-had the honour of once shaking hands with the celebrated Mr. Thurtell
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper, these gentlemen greatly distinguish themselves, brightening up
      very much when the ladies leave the table, and proclaiming aloud their
      intention of beginning to spend the evening-a process which is generally
      understood to be satisfactorily performed, when a great deal of wine is
      drunk and a great deal of noise made, both of which feats the out-and-out
      young gentlemen execute to perfection. Having protracted their sitting
      until long after the host and the other guests have adjourned to the
      drawing-room, and finding that they have drained the decanters empty, they
      follow them thither with complexions rather heightened, and faces rather
      bloated with wine; and the agitated lady of the house whispers her friends
      as they waltz together, to the great terror of the whole room, that 'both
      Mr. Blake and Mr. Dummins are very nice sort of young men in their way,
      only they are eccentric persons, and unfortunately rather too wild!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining class of out-and-out young gentlemen is composed of persons,
      who, having no money of their own and a soul above earning any, enjoy
      similar pleasures, nobody knows how. These respectable gentlemen, without
      aiming quite so much at the out-and-out in external appearance, are
      distinguished by all the same amiable and attractive characteristics, in
      an equal or perhaps greater degree, and now and then find their way into
      society, through the medium of the other class of out-and-out young
      gentlemen, who will sometimes carry them home, and who usually pay their
      tavern bills. As they are equally gentlemanly, clever, witty, intelligent,
      wise, and well-bred, we need scarcely have recommended them to the
      peculiar consideration of the young ladies, if it were not that some of
      the gentle creatures whom we hold in such high respect, are perhaps a
      little too apt to confound a great many heavier terms with the light word
      eccentricity, which we beg them henceforth to take in a strictly
      Johnsonian sense, without any liberality or latitude of construction. THE
      VERY FRIENDLY YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      We know-and all people know-so many specimens of this class, that in
      selecting the few heads our limits enable us to take from a great number,
      we have been induced to give the very friendly young gentleman the
      preference over many others, to whose claims upon a more cursory view of
      the question we had felt disposed to assign the priority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very friendly young gentleman is very friendly to everybody, but he
      attaches himself particularly to two, or at most to three families:
      regulating his choice by their dinners, their circle of acquaintance, or
      some other criterion in which he has an immediate interest. He is of any
      age between twenty and forty, unmarried of course, must be fond of
      children, and is expected to make himself generally useful if possible.
      Let us illustrate our meaning by an example, which is the shortest mode
      and the clearest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We encountered one day, by chance, an old friend of whom we had lost sight
      for some years, and who-expressing a strong anxiety to renew our former
      intimacy-urged us to dine with him on an early day, that we might talk
      over old times. We readily assented, adding, that we hoped we should be
      alone. 'Oh, certainly, certainly,' said our friend, 'not a soul with us
      but Mincin.' 'And who is Mincin?' was our natural inquiry. 'O don't mind
      him,' replied our friend, 'he's a most particular friend of mine, and a
      very friendly fellow you will find him;' and so he left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We thought no more about Mincin until we duly presented ourselves at the
      house next day, when, after a hearty welcome, our friend motioned towards
      a gentleman who had been previously showing his teeth by the fireplace,
      and gave us to understand that it was Mr. Mincin, of whom he had spoken.
      It required no great penetration on our part to discover at once that Mr.
      Mincin was in every respect a very friendly young gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am delighted,' said Mincin, hastily advancing, and pressing our hand
      warmly between both of his, 'I am delighted, I am sure, to make your
      acquaintance-(here he smiled)-very much delighted indeed-(here he
      exhibited a little emotion)-I assure you that I have looked forward to it
      anxiously for a very long time:' here he released our hands, and rubbing
      his own, observed, that the day was severe, but that he was delighted to
      perceive from our appearance that it agreed with us wonderfully; and then
      went on to observe, that, notwithstanding the coldness of the weather, he
      had that morning seen in the paper an exceedingly curious paragraph, to
      the effect, that there was now in the garden of Mr. Wilkins of Chichester,
      a pumpkin, measuring four feet in height, and eleven feet seven inches in
      circumference, which he looked upon as a very extraordinary piece of
      intelligence. We ventured to remark, that we had a dim recollection of
      having once or twice before observed a similar paragraph in the public
      prints, upon which Mr. Mincin took us confidentially by the button, and
      said, Exactly, exactly, to be sure, we were very right, and he wondered
      what the editors meant by putting in such things. Who the deuce, he should
      like to know, did they suppose cared about them? that struck him as being
      the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady of the house appeared shortly afterwards, and Mr. Mincin's
      friendliness, as will readily be supposed, suffered no diminution in
      consequence; he exerted much strength and skill in wheeling a large
      easy-chair up to the fire, and the lady being seated in it, carefully
      closed the door, stirred the fire, and looked to the windows to see that
      they admitted no air; having satisfied himself upon all these points, he
      expressed himself quite easy in his mind, and begged to know how she found
      herself to-day. Upon the lady's replying very well, Mr. Mincin (who it
      appeared was a medical gentleman) offered some general remarks upon the
      nature and treatment of colds in the head, which occupied us agreeably
      until dinner-time. During the meal, he devoted himself to complimenting
      everybody, not forgetting himself, so that we were an uncommonly agreeable
      quartette.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you what, Capper,' said Mr. Mincin to our host, as he closed
      the room door after the lady had retired, 'you have very great reason to
      be fond of your wife. Sweet woman, Mrs. Capper, sir!' 'Nay, Mincin-I beg,'
      interposed the host, as we were about to reply that Mrs. Capper
      unquestionably was particularly sweet. 'Pray, Mincin, don't.' 'Why not?'
      exclaimed Mr. Mincin, 'why not? Why should you feel any delicacy before
      your old friend-our old friend, if I may be allowed to call you so, sir;
      why should you, I ask?' We of course wished to know why he should also,
      upon which our friend admitted that Mrs. Capper was a very sweet woman, at
      which admission Mr. Mincin cried 'Bravo!' and begged to propose Mrs.
      Capper with heartfelt enthusiasm, whereupon our host said, 'Thank you,
      Mincin,' with deep feeling; and gave us, in a low voice, to understand,
      that Mincin had saved Mrs. Capper's cousin's life no less than fourteen
      times in a year and a half, which he considered no common circumstance-an
      opinion to which we most cordially subscribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we three were left to entertain ourselves with conversation, Mr.
      Mincin's extreme friendliness became every moment more apparent; he was so
      amazingly friendly, indeed, that it was impossible to talk about anything
      in which he had not the chief concern. We happened to allude to some
      affairs in which our friend and we had been mutually engaged nearly
      fourteen years before, when Mr. Mincin was all at once reminded of a joke
      which our friend had made on that day four years, which he positively must
      insist upon telling-and which he did tell accordingly, with many pleasant
      recollections of what he said, and what Mrs. Capper said, and how he well
      remembered that they had been to the play with orders on the very night
      previous, and had seen Romeo and Juliet, and the pantomime, and how Mrs.
      Capper being faint had been led into the lobby, where she smiled, said it
      was nothing after all, and went back again, with many other interesting
      and absorbing particulars: after which the friendly young gentleman went
      on to assure us, that our friend had experienced a marvellously prophetic
      opinion of that same pantomime, which was of such an admirable kind, that
      two morning papers took the same view next day: to this our friend
      replied, with a little triumph, that in that instance he had some reason
      to think he had been correct, which gave the friendly young gentleman
      occasion to believe that our friend was always correct; and so we went on,
      until our friend, filling a bumper, said he must drink one glass to his
      dear friend Mincin, than whom he would say no man saved the lives of his
      acquaintances more, or had a more friendly heart. Finally, our friend
      having emptied his glass, said, 'God bless you, Mincin,'-and Mr. Mincin
      and he shook hands across the table with much affection and earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But great as the friendly young gentleman is, in a limited scene like
      this, he plays the same part on a larger scale with increased ACclat. Mr.
      Mincin is invited to an evening party with his dear friends the Martins,
      where he meets his dear friends the Cappers, and his dear friends the
      Watsons, and a hundred other dear friends too numerous to mention. He is
      as much at home with the Martins as with the Cappers; but how exquisitely
      he balances his attentions, and divides them among his dear friends! If he
      flirts with one of the Miss Watsons, he has one little Martin on the sofa
      pulling his hair, and the other little Martin on the carpet riding on his
      foot. He carries Mrs. Watson down to supper on one arm, and Miss Martin on
      the other, and takes wine so judiciously, and in such exact order, that it
      is impossible for the most punctilious old lady to consider herself
      neglected. If any young lady, being prevailed upon to sing, become nervous
      afterwards, Mr. Mincin leads her tenderly into the next room, and restores
      her with port wine, which she must take medicinally. If any gentleman be
      standing by the piano during the progress of the ballad, Mr. Mincin seizes
      him by the arm at one point of the melody, and softly beating time the
      while with his head, expresses in dumb show his intense perception of the
      delicacy of the passage. If anybody's self-love is to be flattered, Mr.
      Mincin is at hand. If anybody's overweening vanity is to be pampered, Mr.
      Mincin will surfeit it. What wonder that people of all stations and ages
      recognise Mr. Mincin's friendliness; that he is universally allowed to be
      handsome as amiable; that mothers think him an oracle, daughters a dear,
      brothers a beau, and fathers a wonder! And who would not have the
      reputation of the very friendly young gentleman? THE MILITARY YOUNG
      GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      We are rather at a loss to imagine how it has come to pass that military
      young gentlemen have obtained so much favour in the eyes of the young
      ladies of this kingdom. We cannot think so lightly of them as to suppose
      that the mere circumstance of a man's wearing a red coat ensures him a
      ready passport to their regard; and even if this were the case, it would
      be no satisfactory explanation of the circumstance, because, although the
      analogy may in some degree hold good in the case of mail coachmen and
      guards, still general postmen wear red coats, and they are not to our
      knowledge better received than other men; nor are firemen either, who wear
      (or used to wear) not only red coats, but very resplendent and massive
      badges besides-much larger than epaulettes. Neither do the twopenny
      post-office boys, if the result of our inquiries be correct, find any
      peculiar favour in woman's eyes, although they wear very bright red
      jackets, and have the additional advantage of constantly appearing in
      public on horseback, which last circumstance may be naturally supposed to
      be greatly in their favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have sometimes thought that this phenomenon may take its rise in the
      conventional behaviour of captains and colonels and other gentlemen in red
      coats on the stage, where they are invariably represented as fine
      swaggering fellows, talking of nothing but charming girls, their king and
      country, their honour, and their debts, and crowing over the inferior
      classes of the community, whom they occasionally treat with a little
      gentlemanly swindling, no less to the improvement and pleasure of the
      audience, than to the satisfaction and approval of the choice spirits who
      consort with them. But we will not devote these pages to our speculations
      upon the subject, inasmuch as our business at the present moment is not so
      much with the young ladies who are bewitched by her Majesty's livery as
      with the young gentlemen whose heads are turned by it. For 'heads' we had
      written 'brains;' but upon consideration, we think the former the more
      appropriate word of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      These young gentlemen may be divided into two classes-young gentlemen who
      are actually in the army, and young gentlemen who, having an intense and
      enthusiastic admiration for all things appertaining to a military life,
      are compelled by adverse fortune or adverse relations to wear out their
      existence in some ignoble counting-house. We will take this latter
      description of military young gentlemen first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole heart and soul of the military young gentleman are concentrated
      in his favourite topic. There is nothing that he is so learned upon as
      uniforms; he will tell you, without faltering for an instant, what the
      habiliments of any one regiment are turned up with, what regiment wear
      stripes down the outside and inside of the leg, and how many buttons the
      Tenth had on their coats; he knows to a fraction how many yards and odd
      inches of gold lace it takes to make an ensign in the Guards; is deeply
      read in the comparative merits of different bands, and the apparelling of
      trumpeters; and is very luminous indeed in descanting upon 'crack
      regiments,' and the 'crack' gentlemen who compose them, of whose
      mightiness and grandeur he is never tired of telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were suggesting to a military young gentleman only the other day, after
      he had related to us several dazzling instances of the profusion of
      half-a-dozen honourable ensign somebodies or nobodies in the articles of
      kid gloves and polished boots, that possibly 'cracked' regiments would be
      an improvement upon 'crack,' as being a more expressive and appropriate
      designation, when he suddenly interrupted us by pulling out his watch, and
      observing that he must hurry off to the Park in a cab, or he would be too
      late to hear the band play. Not wishing to interfere with so important an
      engagement, and being in fact already slightly overwhelmed by the
      anecdotes of the honourable ensigns afore-mentioned, we made no attempt to
      detain the military young gentleman, but parted company with ready
      good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some three or four hours afterwards, we chanced to be walking down
      Whitehall, on the Admiralty side of the way, when, as we drew near to one
      of the little stone places in which a couple of horse soldiers mount guard
      in the daytime, we were attracted by the motionless appearance and eager
      gaze of a young gentleman, who was devouring both man and horse with his
      eyes, so eagerly, that he seemed deaf and blind to all that was passing
      around him. We were not much surprised at the discovery that it was our
      friend, the military young gentleman, but we were a little astonished when
      we returned from a walk to South Lambeth to find him still there, looking
      on with the same intensity as before. As it was a very windy day, we felt
      bound to awaken the young gentleman from his reverie, when he inquired of
      us with great enthusiasm, whether 'that was not a glorious spectacle,' and
      proceeded to give us a detailed account of the weight of every article of
      the spectacle's trappings, from the man's gloves to the horse's shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have made it a practice since, to take the Horse Guards in our daily
      walk, and we find it is the custom of military young gentlemen to plant
      themselves opposite the sentries, and contemplate them at leisure, in
      periods varying from fifteen minutes to fifty, and averaging twenty- five.
      We were much struck a day or two since, by the behaviour of a very
      promising young butcher who (evincing an interest in the service, which
      cannot be too strongly commanded or encouraged), after a prolonged
      inspection of the sentry, proceeded to handle his boots with great
      curiosity, and as much composure and indifference as if the man were
      wax-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the really military young gentleman is waiting all this time, and at
      the very moment that an apology rises to our lips, he emerges from the
      barrack gate (he is quartered in a garrison town), and takes the way
      towards the high street. He wears his undress uniform, which somewhat mars
      the glory of his outward man; but still how great, how grand, he is! What
      a happy mixture of ease and ferocity in his gait and carriage, and how
      lightly he carries that dreadful sword under his arm, making no more ado
      about it than if it were a silk umbrella! The lion is sleeping: only think
      if an enemy were in sight, how soon he'd whip it out of the scabbard, and
      what a terrible fellow he would be!
    </p>
    <p>
      But he walks on, thinking of nothing less than blood and slaughter; and
      now he comes in sight of three other military young gentlemen, arm-in-
      arm, who are bearing down towards him, clanking their iron heels on the
      pavement, and clashing their swords with a noise, which should cause all
      peaceful men to quail at heart. They stop to talk. See how the flaxen-
      haired young gentleman with the weak legs-he who has his pocket-
      handkerchief thrust into the breast of his coat-glares upon the
      fainthearted civilians who linger to look upon his glory; how the next
      young gentleman elevates his head in the air, and majestically places his
      arms a-kimbo, while the third stands with his legs very wide apart, and
      clasps his hands behind him. Well may we inquire-not in familiar jest, but
      in respectful earnest-if you call that nothing. Oh! if some encroaching
      foreign power-the Emperor of Russia, for instance, or any of those deep
      fellows, could only see those military young gentlemen as they move on
      together towards the billiard-room over the way, wouldn't he tremble a
      little!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, at the Theatre at night, when the performances are by command of
      Colonel Fitz-Sordust and the officers of the garrison-what a splendid
      sight it is! How sternly the defenders of their country look round the
      house as if in mute assurance to the audience, that they may make
      themselves comfortable regarding any foreign invasion, for they (the
      military young gentlemen) are keeping a sharp look-out, and are ready for
      anything. And what a contrast between them, and that stage-box full of
      grey-headed officers with tokens of many battles about them, who have
      nothing at all in common with the military young gentlemen, and who-but
      for an old-fashioned kind of manly dignity in their looks and
      bearing-might be common hard-working soldiers for anything they take the
      pains to announce to the contrary!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! here is a family just come in who recognise the flaxen-headed young
      gentleman; and the flaxen-headed young gentleman recognises them too, only
      he doesn't care to show it just now. Very well done indeed! He talks
      louder to the little group of military young gentlemen who are standing by
      him, and coughs to induce some ladies in the next box but one to look
      round, in order that their faces may undergo the same ordeal of criticism
      to which they have subjected, in not a wholly inaudible tone, the majority
      of the female portion of the audience. Oh! a gentleman in the same box
      looks round as if he were disposed to resent this as an impertinence; and
      the flaxen-headed young gentleman sees his friends at once, and hurries
      away to them with the most charming cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three young ladies, one young man, and the mamma of the party, receive the
      military young gentleman with great warmth and politeness, and in five
      minutes afterwards the military young gentleman, stimulated by the mamma,
      introduces the two other military young gentlemen with whom he was walking
      in the morning, who take their seats behind the young ladies and commence
      conversation; whereat the mamma bestows a triumphant bow upon a rival
      mamma, who has not succeeded in decoying any military young gentlemen, and
      prepares to consider her visitors from that moment three of the most
      elegant and superior young gentlemen in the whole world. THE POLITICAL
      YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time-not in the days when pigs drank wine, but in a more
      recent period of our history-it was customary to banish politics when
      ladies were present. If this usage still prevailed, we should have had no
      chapter for political young gentlemen, for ladies would have neither known
      nor cared what kind of monster a political young gentleman was. But as
      this good custom in common with many others has 'gone out,' and left no
      word when it is likely to be home again; as political young ladies are by
      no means rare, and political young gentlemen the very reverse of scarce,
      we are bound in the strict discharge of our most responsible duty not to
      neglect this natural division of our subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the political young gentleman be resident in a country town (and there
      are political young gentlemen in country towns sometimes), he is wholly
      absorbed in his politics; as a pair of purple spectacles communicate the
      same uniform tint to all objects near and remote, so the political
      glasses, with which the young gentleman assists his mental vision, give to
      everything the hue and tinge of party feeling. The political young
      gentleman would as soon think of being struck with the beauty of a young
      lady in the opposite interest, as he would dream of marrying his sister to
      the opposite member.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the political young gentleman be a Conservative, he has usually some
      vague ideas about Ireland and the Pope which he cannot very clearly
      explain, but which he knows are the right sort of thing, and not to be
      very easily got over by the other side. He has also some choice sentences
      regarding church and state, culled from the banners in use at the last
      election, with which he intersperses his conversation at intervals with
      surprising effect. But his great topic is the constitution, upon which he
      will declaim, by the hour together, with much heat and fury; not that he
      has any particular information on the subject, but because he knows that
      the constitution is somehow church and state, and church and state somehow
      the constitution, and that the fellows on the other side say it isn't,
      which is quite a sufficient reason for him to say it is, and to stick to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps his greatest topic of all, though, is the people. If a fight takes
      place in a populous town, in which many noses are broken, and a few
      windows, the young gentleman throws down the newspaper with a triumphant
      air, and exclaims, 'Here's your precious people!' If half-a- dozen boys
      run across the course at race time, when it ought to be kept clear, the
      young gentleman looks indignantly round, and begs you to observe the
      conduct of the people; if the gallery demand a hornpipe between the play
      and the afterpiece, the same young gentleman cries 'No' and 'Shame' till
      he is hoarse, and then inquires with a sneer what you think of popular
      moderation now; in short, the people form a never- failing theme for him;
      and when the attorney, on the side of his candidate, dwells upon it with
      great power of eloquence at election time, as he never fails to do, the
      young gentleman and his friends, and the body they head, cheer with great
      violence against the other people, with whom, of course, they have no
      possible connexion. In much the same manner the audience at a theatre
      never fail to be highly amused with any jokes at the expense of the
      public-always laughing heartily at some other public, and never at
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the political young gentleman be a Radical, he is usually a very
      profound person indeed, having great store of theoretical questions to put
      to you, with an infinite variety of possible cases and logical deductions
      therefrom. If he be of the utilitarian school, too, which is more than
      probable, he is particularly pleasant company, having many ingenious
      remarks to offer upon the voluntary principle and various cheerful
      disquisitions connected with the population of the country, the position
      of Great Britain in the scale of nations, and the balance of power. Then
      he is exceedingly well versed in all doctrines of political economy as
      laid down in the newspapers, and knows a great many parliamentary speeches
      by heart; nay, he has a small stock of aphorisms, none of them exceeding a
      couple of lines in length, which will settle the toughest question and
      leave you nothing to say. He gives all the young ladies to understand,
      that Miss Martineau is the greatest woman that ever lived; and when they
      praise the good looks of Mr. Hawkins the new member, says he's very well
      for a representative, all things considered, but he wants a little calling
      to account, and he is more than half afraid it will be necessary to bring
      him down on his knees for that vote on the miscellaneous estimates. At
      this, the young ladies express much wonderment, and say surely a Member of
      Parliament is not to be brought upon his knees so easily; in reply to
      which the political young gentleman smiles sternly, and throws out dark
      hints regarding the speedy arrival of that day, when Members of Parliament
      will be paid salaries, and required to render weekly accounts of their
      proceedings, at which the young ladies utter many expressions of
      astonishment and incredulity, while their lady-mothers regard the prophecy
      as little else than blasphemous.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is extremely improving and interesting to hear two political young
      gentlemen, of diverse opinions, discuss some great question across a
      dinner-table; such as, whether, if the public were admitted to Westminster
      Abbey for nothing, they would or would not convey small chisels and
      hammers in their pockets, and immediately set about chipping all the noses
      off the statues; or whether, if they once got into the Tower for a
      shilling, they would not insist upon trying the crown on their own heads,
      and loading and firing off all the small arms in the armoury, to the great
      discomposure of Whitechapel and the Minories. Upon these, and many other
      momentous questions which agitate the public mind in these desperate days,
      they will discourse with great vehemence and irritation for a considerable
      time together, both leaving off precisely where they began, and each
      thoroughly persuaded that he has got the better of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In society, at assemblies, balls, and playhouses, these political young
      gentlemen are perpetually on the watch for a political allusion, or
      anything which can be tortured or construed into being one; when,
      thrusting themselves into the very smallest openings for their favourite
      discourse, they fall upon the unhappy company tooth and nail. They have
      recently had many favourable opportunities of opening in churches, but as
      there the clergyman has it all his own way, and must not be contradicted,
      whatever politics he preaches, they are fain to hold their tongues until
      they reach the outer door, though at the imminent risk of bursting in the
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such discussions can please nobody but the talkative parties concerned,
      we hope they will henceforth take the hint and discontinue them, otherwise
      we now give them warning, that the ladies have our advice to
      discountenance such talkers altogether. THE DOMESTIC YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us make a slight sketch of our amiable friend, Mr. Felix Nixon. We are
      strongly disposed to think, that if we put him in this place, he will
      answer our purpose without another word of comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix, then, is a young gentleman who lives at home with his mother, just
      within the twopenny-post office circle of three miles from St.
      Martin-le-Grand. He wears Indiarubber goloshes when the weather is at all
      damp, and always has a silk handkerchief neatly folded up in the
      right-hand pocket of his great-coat, to tie over his mouth when he goes
      home at night; moreover, being rather near-sighted, he carries spectacles
      for particular occasions, and has a weakish tremulous voice, of which he
      makes great use, for he talks as much as any old lady breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two chief subjects of Felix's discourse, are himself and his mother,
      both of whom would appear to be very wonderful and interesting persons. As
      Felix and his mother are seldom apart in body, so Felix and his mother are
      scarcely ever separate in spirit. If you ask Felix how he finds himself
      to-day, he prefaces his reply with a long and minute bulletin of his
      mother's state of health; and the good lady in her turn, edifies her
      acquaintance with a circumstantial and alarming account, how he sneezed
      four times and coughed once after being out in the rain the other night,
      but having his feet promptly put into hot water, and his head into a
      flannel-something, which we will not describe more particularly than by
      this delicate allusion, was happily brought round by the next morning, and
      enabled to go to business as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend is not a very adventurous or hot-headed person, but he has
      passed through many dangers, as his mother can testify: there is one great
      story in particular, concerning a hackney coachman who wanted to
      overcharge him one night for bringing them home from the play, upon which
      Felix gave the aforesaid coachman a look which his mother thought would
      have crushed him to the earth, but which did not crush him quite, for he
      continued to demand another sixpence, notwithstanding that Felix took out
      his pocket-book, and, with the aid of a flat candle, pointed out the fare
      in print, which the coachman obstinately disregarding, he shut the
      street-door with a slam which his mother shudders to think of; and then,
      roused to the most appalling pitch of passion by the coachman knocking a
      double knock to show that he was by no means convinced, he broke with
      uncontrollable force from his parent and the servant girl, and running
      into the street without his hat, actually shook his fist at the coachman,
      and came back again with a face as white, Mrs. Nixon says, looking about
      her for a simile, as white as that ceiling. She never will forget his fury
      that night, Never!
    </p>
    <p>
      To this account Felix listens with a solemn face, occasionally looking at
      you to see how it affects you, and when his mother has made an end of it,
      adds that he looked at every coachman he met for three weeks afterwards,
      in hopes that he might see the scoundrel; whereupon Mrs. Nixon, with an
      exclamation of terror, requests to know what he would have done to him if
      he had seen him, at which Felix smiling darkly and clenching his right
      fist, she exclaims, 'Goodness gracious!' with a distracted air, and
      insists upon extorting a promise that he never will on any account do
      anything so rash, which her dutiful son-it being something more than three
      years since the offence was committed-reluctantly concedes, and his
      mother, shaking her head prophetically, fears with a sigh that his spirit
      will lead him into something violent yet. The discourse then, by an easy
      transition, turns upon the spirit which glows within the bosom of Felix,
      upon which point Felix himself becomes eloquent, and relates a thrilling
      anecdote of the time when he used to sit up till two o'clock in the
      morning reading French, and how his mother used to say, 'Felix, you will
      make yourself ill, I know you will;' and how he used to say, 'Mother, I
      don't care-I will do it;' and how at last his mother privately procured a
      doctor to come and see him, who declared, the moment he felt his pulse,
      that if he had gone on reading one night more-only one night more-he must
      have put a blister on each temple, and another between his shoulders; and
      who, as it was, sat down upon the instant, and writing a prescription for
      a blue pill, said it must be taken immediately, or he wouldn't answer for
      the consequences. The recital of these and many other moving perils of the
      like nature, constantly harrows up the feelings of Mr. Nixon's friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nixon has a tolerably extensive circle of female acquaintance, being
      a good-humoured, talkative, bustling little body, and to the unmarried
      girls among them she is constantly vaunting the virtues of her son,
      hinting that she will be a very happy person who wins him, but that they
      must mind their P's and Q's, for he is very particular, and terribly
      severe upon young ladies. At this last caution the young ladies resident
      in the same row, who happen to be spending the evening there, put their
      pocket-handkerchiefs before their mouths, and are troubled with a short
      cough; just then Felix knocks at the door, and his mother drawing the
      tea-table nearer the fire, calls out to him as he takes off his boots in
      the back parlour that he needn't mind coming in in his slippers, for there
      are only the two Miss Greys and Miss Thompson, and she is quite sure they
      will excuse him, and nodding to the two Miss Greys, she adds, in a
      whisper, that Julia Thompson is a great favourite with Felix, at which
      intelligence the short cough comes again, and Miss Thompson in particular
      is greatly troubled with it, till Felix coming in, very faint for want of
      his tea, changes the subject of discourse, and enables her to laugh out
      boldly and tell Amelia Grey not to be so foolish. Here they all three
      laugh, and Mrs. Nixon says they are giddy girls; in which stage of the
      proceedings, Felix, who has by this time refreshened himself with the
      grateful herb that 'cheers but not inebriates,' removes his cup from his
      countenance and says with a knowing smile, that all girls are; whereat his
      admiring mamma pats him on the back and tells him not to be sly, which
      calls forth a general laugh from the young ladies, and another smile from
      Felix, who, thinking he looks very sly indeed, is perfectly satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea being over, the young ladies resume their work, and Felix insists upon
      holding a skein of silk while Miss Thompson winds it on a card. This
      process having been performed to the satisfaction of all parties, he
      brings down his flute in compliance with a request from the youngest Miss
      Grey, and plays divers tunes out of a very small music-book till
      supper-time, when he is very facetious and talkative indeed. Finally,
      after half a tumblerful of warm sherry and water, he gallantly puts on his
      goloshes over his slippers, and telling Miss Thompson's servant to run on
      first and get the door open, escorts that young lady to her house, five
      doors off: the Miss Greys who live in the next house but one stopping to
      peep with merry faces from their own door till he comes back again, when
      they call out 'Very well, Mr. Felix,' and trip into the passage with a
      laugh more musical than any flute that was ever played.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix is rather prim in his appearance, and perhaps a little priggish
      about his books and flute, and so forth, which have all their peculiar
      corners of peculiar shelves in his bedroom; indeed all his female
      acquaintance (and they are good judges) have long ago set him down as a
      thorough old bachelor. He is a favourite with them however, in a certain
      way, as an honest, inoffensive, kind-hearted creature; and as his
      peculiarities harm nobody, not even himself, we are induced to hope that
      many who are not personally acquainted with him will take our good word in
      his behalf, and be content to leave him to a long continuance of his
      harmless existence. THE CENSORIOUS YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an amiable kind of young gentleman going about in society, upon
      whom, after much experience of him, and considerable turning over of the
      subject in our mind, we feel it our duty to affix the above appellation.
      Young ladies mildly call him a 'sarcastic' young gentleman, or a 'severe'
      young gentleman. We, who know better, beg to acquaint them with the fact,
      that he is merely a censorious young gentleman, and nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The censorious young gentleman has the reputation among his familiars of a
      remarkably clever person, which he maintains by receiving all intelligence
      and expressing all opinions with a dubious sneer, accompanied with a half
      smile, expressive of anything you please but good-humour. This sets people
      about thinking what on earth the censorious young gentleman means, and
      they speedily arrive at the conclusion that he means something very deep
      indeed; for they reason in this way-'This young gentleman looks so very
      knowing that he must mean something, and as I am by no means a dull
      individual, what a very deep meaning he must have if I can't find it out!'
      It is extraordinary how soon a censorious young gentleman may make a
      reputation in his own small circle if he bear this in his mind, and
      regulate his proceedings accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As young ladies are generally-not curious, but laudably desirous to
      acquire information, the censorious young gentleman is much talked about
      among them, and many surmises are hazarded regarding him. 'I wonder,'
      exclaims the eldest Miss Greenwood, laying down her work to turn up the
      lamp, 'I wonder whether Mr. Fairfax will ever be married.' 'Bless me,
      dear,' cries Miss Marshall, 'what ever made you think of him?' 'Really I
      hardly know,' replies Miss Greenwood; 'he is such a very mysterious
      person, that I often wonder about him.' 'Well, to tell you the truth,'
      replies Miss Marshall, 'and so do I.' Here two other young ladies profess
      that they are constantly doing the like, and all present appear in the
      same condition except one young lady, who, not scrupling to state that she
      considers Mr. Fairfax 'a horror,' draws down all the opposition of the
      others, which having been expressed in a great many ejaculatory passages,
      such as 'Well, did I ever!'-and 'Lor, Emily, dear!' ma takes up the
      subject, and gravely states, that she must say she does not think Mr.
      Fairfax by any means a horror, but rather takes him to be a young man of
      very great ability; 'and I am quite sure,' adds the worthy lady, 'he
      always means a great deal more than he says.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opens at this point of the disclosure, and who of all people
      alive walks into the room, but the very Mr. Fairfax, who has been the
      subject of conversation! 'Well, it really is curious,' cries ma, 'we were
      at that very moment talking about you.' 'You did me great honour,' replies
      Mr. Fairfax; 'may I venture to ask what you were saying?' 'Why, if you
      must know,' returns the eldest girl, 'we were remarking what a very
      mysterious man you are.' 'Ay, ay!' observes Mr. Fairfax, 'Indeed!' Now Mr.
      Fairfax says this ay, ay, and indeed, which are slight words enough in
      themselves, with so very unfathomable an air, and accompanies them with
      such a very equivocal smile, that ma and the young ladies are more than
      ever convinced that he means an immensity, and so tell him he is a very
      dangerous man, and seems to be always thinking ill of somebody, which is
      precisely the sort of character the censorious young gentleman is most
      desirous to establish; wherefore he says, 'Oh, dear, no,' in a tone,
      obviously intended to mean, 'You have me there,' and which gives them to
      understand that they have hit the right nail on the very centre of its
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the conversation ranges from the mystery overhanging the censorious
      young gentleman's behaviour, to the general topics of the day, he sustains
      his character to admiration. He considers the new tragedy well enough for
      a new tragedy, but Lord bless us-well, no matter; he could say a great
      deal on that point, but he would rather not, lest he should be thought
      ill-natured, as he knows he would be. 'But is not Mr. So- and-so's
      performance truly charming?' inquires a young lady. 'Charming!' replies
      the censorious young gentleman. 'Oh, dear, yes, certainly; very
      charming-oh, very charming indeed.' After this, he stirs the fire, smiling
      contemptuously all the while: and a modest young gentleman, who has been a
      silent listener, thinks what a great thing it must be, to have such a
      critical judgment. Of music, pictures, books, and poetry, the censorious
      young gentleman has an equally fine conception. As to men and women, he
      can tell all about them at a glance. 'Now let us hear your opinion of
      young Mrs. Barker,' says some great believer in the powers of Mr. Fairfax,
      'but don't be too severe.' 'I never am severe,' replies the censorious
      young gentleman. 'Well, never mind that now. She is very lady-like, is she
      not?' 'Lady-like!' repeats the censorious young gentleman (for he always
      repeats when he is at a loss for anything to say). 'Did you observe her
      manner? Bless my heart and soul, Mrs. Thompson, did you observe her
      manner?-that's all I ask.' 'I thought I had done so,' rejoins the poor
      lady, much perplexed; 'I did not observe it very closely perhaps.' 'Oh,
      not very closely,' rejoins the censorious young gentleman, triumphantly.
      'Very good; then I did. Let us talk no more about her.' The censorious
      young gentleman purses up his lips, and nods his head sagely, as he says
      this; and it is forthwith whispered about, that Mr. Fairfax (who, though
      he is a little prejudiced, must be admitted to be a very excellent judge)
      has observed something exceedingly odd in Mrs. Barker's manner. THE FUNNY
      YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      As one funny young gentleman will serve as a sample of all funny young
      Gentlemen we purpose merely to note down the conduct and behaviour of an
      individual specimen of this class, whom we happened to meet at an annual
      family Christmas party in the course of this very last Christmas that ever
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all seated round a blazing fire which crackled pleasantly as the
      guests talked merrily and the urn steamed cheerily-for, being an old-
      fashioned party, there was an urn, and a teapot besides-when there came a
      postman's knock at the door, so violent and sudden, that it startled the
      whole circle, and actually caused two or three very interesting and most
      unaffected young ladies to scream aloud and to exhibit many afflicting
      symptoms of terror and distress, until they had been several times assured
      by their respective adorers, that they were in no danger. We were about to
      remark that it was surely beyond post-time, and must have been a runaway
      knock, when our host, who had hitherto been paralysed with wonder, sank
      into a chair in a perfect ecstasy of laughter, and offered to lay twenty
      pounds that it was that droll dog Griggins. He had no sooner said this,
      than the majority of the company and all the children of the house burst
      into a roar of laughter too, as if some inimitable joke flashed upon them
      simultaneously, and gave vent to various exclamations of-To be sure it
      must be Griggins, and How like him that was, and What spirits he was
      always in! with many other commendatory remarks of the like nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having the happiness to know Griggins, we became extremely desirous to
      see so pleasant a fellow, the more especially as a stout gentleman with a
      powdered head, who was sitting with his breeches buckles almost touching
      the hob, whispered us he was a wit of the first water, when the door
      opened, and Mr. Griggins being announced, presented himself, amidst
      another shout of laughter and a loud clapping of hands from the younger
      branches. This welcome he acknowledged by sundry contortions of
      countenance, imitative of the clown in one of the new pantomimes, which
      were so extremely successful, that one stout gentleman rolled upon an
      ottoman in a paroxysm of delight, protesting, with many gasps, that if
      somebody didn't make that fellow Griggins leave off, he would be the death
      of him, he knew. At this the company only laughed more boisterously than
      before, and as we always like to accommodate our tone and spirit if
      possible to the humour of any society in which we find ourself, we laughed
      with the rest, and exclaimed, 'Oh! capital, capital!' as loud as any of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had quite exhausted all beholders, Mr. Griggins received the
      welcomes and congratulations of the circle, and went through the needful
      introductions with much ease and many puns. This ceremony over, he avowed
      his intention of sitting in somebody's lap unless the young ladies made
      room for him on the sofa, which being done, after a great deal of
      tittering and pleasantry, he squeezed himself among them, and likened his
      condition to that of love among the roses. At this novel jest we all
      roared once more. 'You should consider yourself highly honoured, sir,'
      said we. 'Sir,' replied Mr. Griggins, 'you do me proud.' Here everybody
      laughed again; and the stout gentleman by the fire whispered in our ear
      that Griggins was making a dead set at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea-things having been removed, we all sat down to a round game, and
      here Mr. Griggins shone forth with peculiar brilliancy, abstracting other
      people's fish, and looking over their hands in the most comical manner. He
      made one most excellent joke in snuffing a candle, which was neither more
      nor less than setting fire to the hair of a pale young gentleman who sat
      next him, and afterwards begging his pardon with considerable humour. As
      the young gentleman could not see the joke however, possibly in
      consequence of its being on the top of his own head, it did not go off
      quite as well as it might have done; indeed, the young gentleman was heard
      to murmur some general references to 'impertinence,' and a 'rascal,' and
      to state the number of his lodgings in an angry tone-a turn of the
      conversation which might have been productive of slaughterous
      consequences, if a young lady, betrothed to the young gentleman, had not
      used her immediate influence to bring about a reconciliation: emphatically
      declaring in an agitated whisper, intended for his peculiar edification
      but audible to the whole table, that if he went on in that way, she never
      would think of him otherwise than as a friend, though as that she must
      always regard him. At this terrible threat the young gentleman became
      calm, and the young lady, overcome by the revulsion of feeling,
      instantaneously fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Griggins's spirits were slightly depressed for a short period by this
      unlooked-for result of such a harmless pleasantry, but being promptly
      elevated by the attentions of the host and several glasses of wine, he
      soon recovered, and became even more vivacious than before, insomuch that
      the stout gentleman previously referred to, assured us that although he
      had known him since he was that high (something smaller than a
      nutmeg-grater), he had never beheld him in such excellent cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the round game and several games at blind man's buff which followed
      it were all over, and we were going down to supper, the inexhaustible Mr.
      Griggins produced a small sprig of mistletoe from his waistcoat pocket,
      and commenced a general kissing of the assembled females, which occasioned
      great commotion and much excitement. We observed that several young
      gentlemen-including the young gentleman with the pale countenance-were
      greatly scandalised at this indecorous proceeding, and talked very big
      among themselves in corners; and we observed too, that several young
      ladies when remonstrated with by the aforesaid young gentlemen, called
      each other to witness how they had struggled, and protested vehemently
      that it was very rude, and that they were surprised at Mrs. Brown's
      allowing it, and that they couldn't bear it, and had no patience with such
      impertinence. But such is the gentle and forgiving nature of woman, that
      although we looked very narrowly for it, we could not detect the slightest
      harshness in the subsequent treatment of Mr. Griggins. Indeed, upon the
      whole, it struck us that among the ladies he seemed rather more popular
      than before!
    </p>
    <p>
      To recount all the drollery of Mr. Griggins at supper, would fill such a
      tiny volume as this, <a href="#linknote-429" id="linknoteref-429"><small>429</small></a> to the very bottom of the
      outside cover. How he drank out of other people's glasses, and ate of
      other people's bread, how he frightened into screaming convulsions a
      little boy who was sitting up to supper in a high chair, by sinking below
      the table and suddenly reappearing with a mask on; how the hostess was
      really surprised that anybody could find a pleasure in tormenting
      children, and how the host frowned at the hostess, and felt convinced that
      Mr. Griggins had done it with the very best intentions; how Mr. Griggins
      explained, and how everybody's good-humour was restored but the
      child's;-to tell these and a hundred other things ever so briefly, would
      occupy more of our room and our readers' patience, than either they or we
      can conveniently spare. Therefore we change the subject, merely observing
      that we have offered no description of the funny young gentleman's
      personal appearance, believing that almost every society has a Griggins of
      its own, and leaving all readers to supply the deficiency, according to
      the particular circumstances of their particular case. THE THEATRICAL
      YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      All gentlemen who love the drama-and there are few gentlemen who are not
      attached to the most intellectual and rational of all our amusements-do
      not come within this definition. As we have no mean relish for theatrical
      entertainments ourself, we are disinterestedly anxious that this should be
      perfectly understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatrical young gentleman has early and important information on all
      theatrical topics. 'Well,' says he, abruptly, when you meet him in the
      street, 'here's a pretty to-do. Flimkins has thrown up his part in the
      melodrama at the Surrey.'-'And what's to be done?' you inquire with as
      much gravity as you can counterfeit. 'Ah, that's the point,' replies the
      theatrical young gentleman, looking very serious; 'Boozle declines it;
      positively declines it. From all I am told, I should say it was decidedly
      in Boozle's line, and that he would be very likely to make a great hit in
      it; but he objects on the ground of Flimkins having been put up in the
      part first, and says no earthly power shall induce him to take the
      character. It's a fine part, too-excellent business, I'm told. He has to
      kill six people in the course of the piece, and to fight over a bridge in
      red fire, which is as safe a card, you know, as can be. Don't mention it;
      but I hear that the last scene, when he is first poisoned, and then
      stabbed, by Mrs. Flimkins as Vengedora, will be the greatest thing that
      has been done these many years.' With this piece of news, and laying his
      finger on his lips as a caution for you not to excite the town with it,
      the theatrical young gentleman hurries away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatrical young gentleman, from often frequenting the different
      theatrical establishments, has pet and familiar names for them all. Thus
      Covent-Garden is the garden, Drury-Lane the lane, the Victoria the vic,
      and the Olympic the pic. Actresses, too, are always designated by their
      surnames only, as Taylor, Nisbett, Faucit, Honey; that talented and
      lady-like girl Sheriff, that clever little creature Horton, and so on. In
      the same manner he prefixes Christian names when he mentions actors, as
      Charley Young, Jemmy Buckstone, Fred. Yates, Paul Bedford. When he is at a
      loss for a Christian name, the word 'old' applied indiscriminately answers
      quite as well: as old Charley Matthews at Vestris's, old Harley, and old
      Braham. He has a great knowledge of the private proceedings of actresses,
      especially of their getting married, and can tell you in a breath
      half-a-dozen who have changed their names without avowing it. Whenever an
      alteration of this kind is made in the playbills, he will remind you that
      he let you into the secret six months ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatrical young gentleman has a great reverence for all that is
      connected with the stage department of the different theatres. He would,
      at any time, prefer going a street or two out of his way, to omitting to
      pass a stage-entrance, into which he always looks with a curious and
      searching eye. If he can only identify a popular actor in the street, he
      is in a perfect transport of delight; and no sooner meets him, than he
      hurries back, and walks a few paces in front of him, so that he can turn
      round from time to time, and have a good stare at his features. He looks
      upon a theatrical-fund dinner as one of the most enchanting festivities
      ever known; and thinks that to be a member of the Garrick Club, and see so
      many actors in their plain clothes, must be one of the highest
      gratifications the world can bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatrical young gentleman is a constant half-price visitor at one or
      other of the theatres, and has an infinite relish for all pieces which
      display the fullest resources of the establishment. He likes to place
      implicit reliance upon the play-bills when he goes to see a show- piece,
      and works himself up to such a pitch of enthusiasm, as not only to believe
      (if the bills say so) that there are three hundred and seventy-five people
      on the stage at one time in the last scene, but is highly indignant with
      you, unless you believe it also. He considers that if the stage be opened
      from the foot-lights to the back wall, in any new play, the piece is a
      triumph of dramatic writing, and applauds accordingly. He has a great
      notion of trap-doors too; and thinks any character going down or coming up
      a trap (no matter whether he be an angel or a demon-they both do it
      occasionally) one of the most interesting feats in the whole range of
      scenic illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these acquirements, he has several veracious accounts to
      communicate of the private manners and customs of different actors, which,
      during the pauses of a quadrille, he usually communicates to his partner,
      or imparts to his neighbour at a supper table. Thus he is advised, that
      Mr. Liston always had a footman in gorgeous livery waiting at the
      side-scene with a brandy bottle and tumbler, to administer half a pint or
      so of spirit to him every time he came off, without which assistance he
      must infallibly have fainted. He knows for a fact, that, after an arduous
      part, Mr. George Bennett is put between two feather beds, to absorb the
      perspiration; and is credibly informed, that Mr. Baker has, for many
      years, submitted to a course of lukewarm toast-and- water, to qualify him
      to sustain his favourite characters. He looks upon Mr. Fitz Ball as the
      principal dramatic genius and poet of the day; but holds that there are
      great writers extant besides him,-in proof whereof he refers you to
      various dramas and melodramas recently produced, of which he takes in all
      the sixpenny and three-penny editions as fast as they appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatrical young gentleman is a great advocate for violence of emotion
      and redundancy of action. If a father has to curse a child upon the stage,
      he likes to see it done in the thorough-going style, with no mistake about
      it: to which end it is essential that the child should follow the father
      on her knees, and be knocked violently over on her face by the old
      gentleman as he goes into a small cottage, and shuts the door behind him.
      He likes to see a blessing invoked upon the young lady, when the old
      gentleman repents, with equal earnestness, and accompanied by the usual
      conventional forms, which consist of the old gentleman looking anxiously
      up into the clouds, as if to see whether it rains, and then spreading an
      imaginary tablecloth in the air over the young lady's head-soft music
      playing all the while. Upon these, and other points of a similar kind, the
      theatrical young gentleman is a great critic indeed. He is likewise very
      acute in judging of natural expressions of the passions, and knows
      precisely the frown, wink, nod, or leer, which stands for any one of them,
      or the means by which it may be converted into any other: as jealousy,
      with a good stamp of the right foot, becomes anger; or wildness, with the
      hands clasped before the throat, instead of tearing the wig, is passionate
      love. If you venture to express a doubt of the accuracy of any of these
      portraitures, the theatrical young gentleman assures you, with a haughty
      smile, that it always has been done in that way, and he supposes they are
      not going to change it at this time of day to please you; to which, of
      course, you meekly reply that you suppose not.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are innumerable disquisitions of this nature, in which the
      theatrical young gentleman is very profound, especially to ladies whom he
      is most in the habit of entertaining with them; but as we have no space to
      recapitulate them at greater length, we must rest content with calling the
      attention of the young ladies in general to the theatrical young gentlemen
      of their own acquaintance. THE POETICAL YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was, and not very long ago either, when a singular epidemic raged
      among the young gentlemen, vast numbers of whom, under the influence of
      the malady, tore off their neckerchiefs, turned down their shirt collars,
      and exhibited themselves in the open streets with bare throats and
      dejected countenances, before the eyes of an astonished public. These were
      poetical young gentlemen. The custom was gradually found to be
      inconvenient, as involving the necessity of too much clean linen and too
      large washing bills, and these outward symptoms have consequently passed
      away; but we are disposed to think, notwithstanding, that the number of
      poetical young gentlemen is considerably on the increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know a poetical young gentleman-a very poetical young gentleman. We do
      not mean to say that he is troubled with the gift of poesy in any
      remarkable degree, but his countenance is of a plaintive and melancholy
      cast, his manner is abstracted and bespeaks affliction of soul: he seldom
      has his hair cut, and often talks about being an outcast and wanting a
      kindred spirit; from which, as well as from many general observations in
      which he is wont to indulge, concerning mysterious impulses, and yearnings
      of the heart, and the supremacy of intellect gilding all earthly things
      with the glowing magic of immortal verse, it is clear to all his friends
      that he has been stricken poetical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The favourite attitude of the poetical young gentleman is lounging on a
      sofa with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, or sitting bolt upright in a
      high-backed chair, staring with very round eyes at the opposite wall. When
      he is in one of these positions, his mother, who is a worthy, affectionate
      old soul, will give you a nudge to bespeak your attention without
      disturbing the abstracted one, and whisper with a shake of the head, that
      John's imagination is at some extraordinary work or other, you may take
      her word for it. Hereupon John looks more fiercely intent upon vacancy
      than before, and suddenly snatching a pencil from his pocket, puts down
      three words, and a cross on the back of a card, sighs deeply, paces once
      or twice across the room, inflicts a most unmerciful slap upon his head,
      and walks moodily up to his dormitory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetical young gentleman is apt to acquire peculiar notions of things
      too, which plain ordinary people, unblessed with a poetical obliquity of
      vision, would suppose to be rather distorted. For instance, when the
      sickening murder and mangling of a wretched woman was affording delicious
      food wherewithal to gorge the insatiable curiosity of the public, our
      friend the poetical young gentleman was in ecstasies-not of disgust, but
      admiration. 'Heavens!' cried the poetical young gentleman, 'how grand; how
      great!' We ventured deferentially to inquire upon whom these epithets were
      bestowed: our humble thoughts oscillating between the police officer who
      found the criminal, and the lock-keeper who found the head. 'Upon whom!'
      exclaimed the poetical young gentleman in a frenzy of poetry, 'Upon whom
      should they be bestowed but upon the murderer!'-and thereupon it came out,
      in a fine torrent of eloquence, that the murderer was a great spirit, a
      bold creature full of daring and nerve, a man of dauntless heart and
      determined courage, and withal a great casuist and able reasoner, as was
      fully demonstrated in his philosophical colloquies with the great and
      noble of the land. We held our peace, and meekly signified our
      indisposition to controvert these opinions-firstly, because we were no
      match at quotation for the poetical young gentleman; and secondly, because
      we felt it would be of little use our entering into any disputation, if we
      were: being perfectly convinced that the respectable and immoral hero in
      question is not the first and will not be the last hanged gentleman upon
      whom false sympathy or diseased curiosity will be plentifully expended.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a stern mystic flight of the poetical young gentleman. In his
      milder and softer moments he occasionally lays down his neckcloth, and
      pens stanzas, which sometimes find their way into a Lady's Magazine, or
      the 'Poets' Corner' of some country newspaper; or which, in default of
      either vent for his genius, adorn the rainbow leaves of a lady's album.
      These are generally written upon some such occasions as contemplating the
      Bank of England by midnight, or beholding Saint Paul's in a snow- storm;
      and when these gloomy objects fail to afford him inspiration, he pours
      forth his soul in a touching address to a violet, or a plaintive lament
      that he is no longer a child, but has gradually grown up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetical young gentleman is fond of quoting passages from his
      favourite authors, who are all of the gloomy and desponding school. He has
      a great deal to say too about the world, and is much given to opining,
      especially if he has taken anything strong to drink, that there is nothing
      in it worth living for. He gives you to understand, however, that for the
      sake of society, he means to bear his part in the tiresome play, manfully
      resisting the gratification of his own strong desire to make a premature
      exit; and consoles himself with the reflection, that immortality has some
      chosen nook for himself and the other great spirits whom earth has chafed
      and wearied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the poetical young gentleman makes use of adjectives, they are all
      superlatives. Everything is of the grandest, greatest, noblest, mightiest,
      loftiest; or the lowest, meanest, obscurest, vilest, and most pitiful. He
      knows no medium: for enthusiasm is the soul of poetry; and who so
      enthusiastic as a poetical young gentleman? 'Mr. Milkwash,' says a young
      lady as she unlocks her album to receive the young gentleman's original
      impromptu contribution, 'how very silent you are! I think you must be in
      love.' 'Love!' cries the poetical young gentleman, starting from his seat
      by the fire and terrifying the cat who scampers off at full speed, 'Love!
      that burning, consuming passion; that ardour of the soul, that fierce
      glowing of the heart. Love! The withering, blighting influence of hope
      misplaced and affection slighted. Love did you say! Ha! ha! ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, the poetical young gentleman laughs a laugh belonging only to
      poets and Mr. O. Smith of the Adelphi Theatre, and sits down, pen in hand,
      to throw off a page or two of verse in the biting, semi- atheistical
      demoniac style, which, like the poetical young gentleman himself, is full
      of sound and fury, signifying nothing. THE 'THROWING- OFF' YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain kind of impostor-a bragging, vaunting, puffing young
      gentleman-against whom we are desirous to warn that fairer part of the
      creation, to whom we more peculiarly devote these our labours. And we are
      particularly induced to lay especial stress upon this division of our
      subject, by a little dialogue we held some short time ago, with an
      esteemed young lady of our acquaintance, touching a most gross specimen of
      this class of men. We had been urging all the absurdities of his conduct
      and conversation, and dwelling upon the impossibilities he constantly
      recounted-to which indeed we had not scrupled to prefix a certain hard
      little word of one syllable and three letters-when our fair friend, unable
      to maintain the contest any longer, reluctantly cried, 'Well; he certainly
      has a habit of throwing-off, but then-' What then? Throw him off yourself,
      said we. And so she did, but not at our instance, for other reasons
      appeared, and it might have been better if she had done so at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throwing-off young gentleman has so often a father possessed of vast
      property in some remote district of Ireland, that we look with some
      suspicion upon all young gentlemen who volunteer this description of
      themselves. The deceased grandfather of the throwing-off young gentleman
      was a man of immense possessions, and untold wealth; the throwing-off
      young gentleman remembers, as well as if it were only yesterday, the
      deceased baronet's library, with its long rows of scarce and valuable
      books in superbly embossed bindings, arranged in cases, reaching from the
      lofty ceiling to the oaken floor; and the fine antique chairs and tables,
      and the noble old castle of Ballykillbabaloo, with its splendid prospect
      of hill and dale, and wood, and rich wild scenery, and the fine hunting
      stables and the spacious court-yards, 'and-and-everything upon the same
      magnificent scale,' says the throwing- off young gentleman, 'princely;
      quite princely. Ah!' And he sighs as if mourning over the fallen fortunes
      of his noble house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throwing-off young gentleman is a universal genius; at walking,
      running, rowing, swimming, and skating, he is unrivalled; at all games of
      chance or skill, at hunting, shooting, fishing, riding, driving, or
      amateur theatricals, no one can touch him-that is could not, because he
      gives you carefully to understand, lest there should be any opportunity of
      testing his skill, that he is quite out of practice just now, and has been
      for some years. If you mention any beautiful girl of your common
      acquaintance in his hearing, the throwing-off young gentleman starts,
      smiles, and begs you not to mind him, for it was quite involuntary: people
      do say indeed that they were once engaged, but no-although she is a very
      fine girl, he was so situated at that time that he couldn't possibly
      encourage the-'but it's of no use talking about it!' he adds, interrupting
      himself. 'She has got over it now, and I firmly hope and trust is happy.'
      With this benevolent aspiration he nods his head in a mysterious manner,
      and whistling the first part of some popular air, thinks perhaps it will
      be better to change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another great characteristic of the throwing-off young gentleman,
      which is, that he 'happens to be acquainted' with a most extraordinary
      variety of people in all parts of the world. Thus in all disputed
      questions, when the throwing-off young gentleman has no argument to bring
      forward, he invariably happens to be acquainted with some distant person,
      intimately connected with the subject, whose testimony decides the point
      against you, to the great-may we say it-to the great admiration of three
      young ladies out of every four, who consider the throwing-off young
      gentleman a very highly-connected young man, and a most charming person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the throwing-off young gentleman happens to look in upon a
      little family circle of young ladies who are quietly spending the evening
      together, and then indeed is he at the very height and summit of his
      glory; for it is to be observed that he by no means shines to equal
      advantage in the presence of men as in the society of over-credulous young
      ladies, which is his proper element. It is delightful to hear the number
      of pretty things the throwing-off young gentleman gives utterance to,
      during tea, and still more so to observe the ease with which, from long
      practice and study, he delicately blends one compliment to a lady with two
      for himself. 'Did you ever see a more lovely blue than this flower, Mr.
      Caveton?' asks a young lady who, truth to tell, is rather smitten with the
      throwing-off young gentleman. 'Never,' he replies, bending over the object
      of admiration, 'never but in your eyes.' 'Oh, Mr. Caveton,' cries the
      young lady, blushing of course. 'Indeed I speak the truth,' replies the
      throwing-off young gentleman, 'I never saw any approach to them. I used to
      think my cousin's blue eyes lovely, but they grow dim and colourless
      beside yours.' 'Oh! a beautiful cousin, Mr. Caveton!' replies the young
      lady, with that perfect artlessness which is the distinguishing
      characteristic of all young ladies; 'an affair, of course.' 'No; indeed,
      indeed you wrong me,' rejoins the throwing-off young gentleman with great
      energy. 'I fervently hope that her attachment towards me may be nothing
      but the natural result of our close intimacy in childhood, and that in
      change of scene and among new faces she may soon overcome it. I love her!
      Think not so meanly of me, Miss Lowfield, I beseech, as to suppose that
      title, lands, riches, and beauty, can influence my choice. The heart, the
      heart, Miss Lowfield.' Here the throwing-off young gentleman sinks his
      voice to a still lower whisper; and the young lady duly proclaims to all
      the other young ladies when they go up-stairs, to put their bonnets on,
      that Mr. Caveton's relations are all immensely rich, and that he is
      hopelessly beloved by title, lands, riches, and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen a throwing-off young gentleman who, to our certain knowledge,
      was innocent of a note of music, and scarcely able to recognise a tune by
      ear, volunteer a Spanish air upon the guitar when he had previously
      satisfied himself that there was not such an instrument within a mile of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard another throwing-off young gentleman, after striking a note
      or two upon the piano, and accompanying it correctly (by dint of laborious
      practice) with his voice, assure a circle of wondering listeners that so
      acute was his ear that he was wholly unable to sing out of tune, let him
      try as he would. We have lived to witness the unmasking of another
      throwing-off young gentleman, who went out a visiting in a military cap
      with a gold band and tassel, and who, after passing successfully for a
      captain and being lauded to the skies for his red whiskers, his bravery,
      his soldierly bearing and his pride, turned out to be the dishonest son of
      an honest linen-draper in a small country town, and whom, if it were not
      for this fortunate exposure, we should not yet despair of encountering as
      the fortunate husband of some rich heiress. Ladies, ladies, the
      throwing-off young gentlemen are often swindlers, and always fools. So
      pray you avoid them. THE YOUNG LADIES' YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </p>
    <p>
      This young gentleman has several titles. Some young ladies consider him 'a
      nice young man,' others 'a fine young man,' others 'quite a lady's man,'
      others 'a handsome man,' others 'a remarkably good-looking young man.'
      With some young ladies he is 'a perfect angel,' and with others 'quite a
      love.' He is likewise a charming creature, a duck, and a dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies' young gentleman has usually a fresh colour and very
      white teeth, which latter articles, of course, he displays on every
      possible opportunity. He has brown or black hair, and whiskers of the
      same, if possible; but a slight tinge of red, or the hue which is vulgarly
      known as sandy, is not considered an objection. If his head and face be
      large, his nose prominent, and his figure square, he is an uncommonly fine
      young man, and worshipped accordingly. Should his whiskers meet beneath
      his chin, so much the better, though this is not absolutely insisted on;
      but he must wear an under-waistcoat, and smile constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great party got up by some party-loving friends of ours last
      summer, to go and dine in Epping Forest. As we hold that such wild
      expeditions should never be indulged in, save by people of the smallest
      means, who have no dinner at home, we should indubitably have excused
      ourself from attending, if we had not recollected that the projectors of
      the excursion were always accompanied on such occasions by a choice sample
      of the young ladies' young gentleman, whom we were very anxious to have an
      opportunity of meeting. This determined us, and we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were to make for Chigwell in four glass coaches, each with a trifling
      company of six or eight inside, and a little boy belonging to the
      projectors on the box-and to start from the residence of the projectors,
      Woburn-place, Russell-square, at half-past ten precisely. We arrived at
      the place of rendezvous at the appointed time, and found the glass coaches
      and the little boys quite ready, and divers young ladies and young
      gentlemen looking anxiously over the breakfast-parlour blinds, who
      appeared by no means so much gratified by our approach as we might have
      expected, but evidently wished we had been somebody else. Observing that
      our arrival in lieu of the unknown occasioned some disappointment, we
      ventured to inquire who was yet to come, when we found from the hasty
      reply of a dozen voices, that it was no other than the young ladies' young
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot imagine,' said the mamma, 'what has become of Mr. Balim-always
      so punctual, always so pleasant and agreeable. I am sure I can-not think.'
      As these last words were uttered in that measured, emphatic manner which
      painfully announces that the speaker has not quite made up his or her mind
      what to say, but is determined to talk on nevertheless, the eldest
      daughter took up the subject, and hoped no accident had happened to Mr.
      Balim, upon which there was a general chorus of 'Dear Mr. Balim!' and one
      young lady, more adventurous than the rest, proposed that an express
      should be straightway sent to dear Mr. Balim's lodgings. This, however,
      the papa resolutely opposed, observing, in what a short young lady behind
      us termed 'quite a bearish way,' that if Mr. Balim didn't choose to come,
      he might stop at home. At this all the daughters raised a murmur of 'Oh
      pa!' except one sprightly little girl of eight or ten years old, who,
      taking advantage of a pause in the discourse, remarked, that perhaps Mr.
      Balim might have been married that morning-for which impertinent
      suggestion she was summarily ejected from the room by her eldest sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all in a state of great mortification and uneasiness, when one of
      the little boys, running into the room as airily as little boys usually
      run who have an unlimited allowance of animal food in the holidays, and
      keep their hands constantly forced down to the bottoms of very deep
      trouser-pockets when they take exercise, joyfully announced that Mr. Balim
      was at that moment coming up the street in a hackney-cab; and the
      intelligence was confirmed beyond all doubt a minute afterwards by the
      entry of Mr. Balim himself, who was received with repeated cries of 'Where
      have you been, you naughty creature?' whereunto the naughty creature
      replied, that he had been in bed, in consequence of a late party the night
      before, and had only just risen. The acknowledgment awakened a variety of
      agonizing fears that he had taken no breakfast; which appearing after a
      slight cross-examination to be the real state of the case, breakfast for
      one was immediately ordered, notwithstanding Mr. Balim's repeated
      protestations that he couldn't think of it. He did think of it though, and
      thought better of it too, for he made a remarkably good meal when it came,
      and was assiduously served by a select knot of young ladies. It was quite
      delightful to see how he ate and drank, while one pair of fair hands
      poured out his coffee, and another put in the sugar, and another the milk;
      the rest of the company ever and anon casting angry glances at their
      watches, and the glass coaches,-and the little boys looking on in an agony
      of apprehension lest it should begin to rain before we set out; it might
      have rained all day, after we were once too far to turn back again, and
      welcome, for aught they cared.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the cavalcade moved at length, every coachman being accommodated
      with a hamper between his legs something larger than a wheelbarrow; and
      the company being packed as closely as they possibly could in the
      carriages, 'according,' as one married lady observed, 'to the immemorial
      custom, which was half the diversion of gipsy parties.' Thinking it very
      likely it might be (we have never been able to discover the other half),
      we submitted to be stowed away with a cheerful aspect, and were fortunate
      enough to occupy one corner of a coach in which were one old lady, four
      young ladies, and the renowned Mr. Balim the young ladies' young
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were no sooner fairly off, than the young ladies' young gentleman
      hummed a fragment of an air, which induced a young lady to inquire whether
      he had danced to that the night before. 'By Heaven, then, I did,' replied
      the young gentleman, 'and with a lovely heiress; a superb creature, with
      twenty thousand pounds.' 'You seem rather struck,' observed another young
      lady. ''Gad she was a sweet creature,' returned the young gentleman,
      arranging his hair. 'Of course she was struck too?' inquired the first
      young lady. 'How can you ask, love?' interposed the second; 'could she
      fail to be?' 'Well, honestly I think she was,' observed the young
      gentleman. At this point of the dialogue, the young lady who had spoken
      first, and who sat on the young gentleman's right, struck him a severe
      blow on the arm with a rosebud, and said he was a vain man-whereupon the
      young gentleman insisted on having the rosebud, and the young lady
      appealing for help to the other young ladies, a charming struggle ensued,
      terminating in the victory of the young gentleman, and the capture of the
      rosebud. This little skirmish over, the married lady, who was the mother
      of the rosebud, smiled sweetly upon the young gentleman, and accused him
      of being a flirt; the young gentleman pleading not guilty, a most
      interesting discussion took place upon the important point whether the
      young gentleman was a flirt or not, which being an agreeable conversation
      of a light kind, lasted a considerable time. At length, a short silence
      occurring, the young ladies on either side of the young gentleman fell
      suddenly fast asleep; and the young gentleman, winking upon us to preserve
      silence, won a pair of gloves from each, thereby causing them to wake with
      equal suddenness and to scream very loud. The lively conversation to which
      this pleasantry gave rise, lasted for the remainder of the ride, and would
      have eked out a much longer one.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dined rather more comfortably than people usually do under such
      circumstances, nothing having been left behind but the cork-screw and the
      bread. The married gentlemen were unusually thirsty, which they attributed
      to the heat of the weather; the little boys ate to inconvenience; mammas
      were very jovial, and their daughters very fascinating; and the attendants
      being well-behaved men, got exceedingly drunk at a respectful distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had our eye on Mr. Balim at dinner-time, and perceived that he
      flourished wonderfully, being still surrounded by a little group of young
      ladies, who listened to him as an oracle, while he ate from their plates
      and drank from their glasses in a manner truly captivating from its
      excessive playfulness. His conversation, too, was exceedingly brilliant.
      In fact, one elderly lady assured us, that in the course of a little
      lively badinage on the subject of ladies' dresses, he had evinced as much
      knowledge as if he had been born and bred a milliner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such of the fat people who did not happen to fall asleep after dinner
      entered upon a most vigorous game at ball, we slipped away alone into a
      thicker part of the wood, hoping to fall in with Mr. Balim, the greater
      part of the young people having dropped off in twos and threes and the
      young ladies' young gentleman among them. Nor were we disappointed, for we
      had not walked far, when, peeping through the trees, we discovered him
      before us, and truly it was a pleasant thing to contemplate his greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies' young gentleman was seated upon the ground, at the feet
      of a few young ladies who were reclining on a bank; he was so profusely
      decked with scarfs, ribands, flowers, and other pretty spoils, that he
      looked like a lamb-or perhaps a calf would be a better simile-adorned for
      the sacrifice. One young lady supported a parasol over his interesting
      head, another held his hat, and a third his neck- cloth, which in romantic
      fashion he had thrown off; the young gentleman himself, with his hand upon
      his breast, and his face moulded into an expression of the most honeyed
      sweetness, was warbling forth some choice specimens of vocal music in
      praise of female loveliness, in a style so exquisitely perfect, that we
      burst into an involuntary shout of laughter, and made a hasty retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      What charming fellows these young ladies' young gentlemen are! Ducks,
      dears, loves, angels, are all terms inadequate to express their merit.
      They are such amazingly, uncommonly, wonderfully, nice men. CONCLUSION
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have placed before the young ladies so many specimens of young
      gentlemen, and have also in the dedication of this volume given them to
      understand how much we reverence and admire their numerous virtues and
      perfections; as we have given them such strong reasons to treat us with
      confidence, and to banish, in our case, all that reserve and distrust of
      the male sex which, as a point of general behaviour, they cannot do better
      than preserve and maintain-we say, as we have done all this, we feel that
      now, when we have arrived at the close of our task, they may naturally
      press upon us the inquiry, what particular description of young gentlemen
      we can conscientiously recommend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we are at a loss. We look over our list, and can neither recommend
      the bashful young gentleman, nor the out-and-out young gentleman, nor the
      very friendly young gentleman, nor the military young gentleman, nor the
      political young gentleman, nor the domestic young gentleman, nor the
      censorious young gentleman, nor the funny young gentleman, nor the
      theatrical young gentleman, nor the poetical young gentleman, nor the
      throwing-off young gentleman, nor the young ladies' young gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there are some good points about many of them, which still are not
      sufficiently numerous to render any one among them eligible, as a whole,
      our respectful advice to the young ladies is, to seek for a young
      gentleman who unites in himself the best qualities of all, and the worst
      weaknesses of none, and to lead him forthwith to the hymeneal altar,
      whether he will or no. And to the young lady who secures him, we beg to
      tender one short fragment of matrimonial advice, selected from many sound
      passages of a similar tendency, to be found in a letter written by Dean
      Swift to a young lady on her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The grand affair of your life will be, to gain and preserve the esteem of
      your husband. Neither good-nature nor virtue will suffer him to esteem you
      against his judgment; and although he is not capable of using you ill, yet
      you will in time grow a thing indifferent and perhaps contemptible; unless
      you can supply the loss of youth and beauty with more durable qualities.
      You have but a very few years to be young and handsome in the eyes of the
      world; and as few months to be so in the eyes of a husband who is not a
      fool; for I hope you do not still dream of charms and raptures, which
      marriage ever did, and ever will, put a sudden end to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      From the anxiety we express for the proper behaviour of the fortunate lady
      after marriage, it may possibly be inferred that the young gentleman to
      whom we have so delicately alluded, is no other than ourself. Without in
      any way committing ourself upon this point, we have merely to observe,
      that we are ready to receive sealed offers containing a full specification
      of age, temper, appearance, and condition; but we beg it to be distinctly
      understood that we do not pledge ourself to accept the highest bidder.
    </p>
    <p>
      These offers may be forwarded to the Publishers, Messrs. Chapman and Hall,
      London; to whom all pieces of plate and other testimonials of approbation
      from the young ladies generally, are respectfully requested to be
      addressed. SKETCHES OF YOUNG COUPLES AN URGENT REMONSTRANCE, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      TO THE GENTLEMEN OF ENGLAND, (being bachelors or widowers,) THE
      REMONSTRANCE OF THEIR FAITHFUL FELLOW-SUBJECT,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheweth,-
    </p>
    <p>
      That Her Most Gracious Majesty, Victoria, by the Grace of God of the
      United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith,
      did, on the 23rd day of November last past, declare and pronounce to Her
      Most Honourable Privy Council, Her Majesty's Most Gracious intention of
      entering into the bonds of wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Her Most Gracious Majesty, in so making known Her Most Gracious
      intention to Her Most Honourable Privy Council as aforesaid, did use and
      employ the words-'It is my intention to ally myself in marriage with
      Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg and Gotha.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That the present is Bissextile, or Leap Year, in which it is held and
      considered lawful for any lady to offer and submit proposals of marriage
      to any gentleman, and to enforce and insist upon acceptance of the same,
      under pain of a certain fine or penalty; to wit, one silk or satin dress
      of the first quality, to be chosen by the lady and paid (or owed) for, by
      the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      That these and other the horrors and dangers with which the said
      Bissextile, or Leap Year, threatens the gentlemen of England on every
      occasion of its periodical return, have been greatly aggravated and
      augmented by the terms of Her Majesty's said Most Gracious communication,
      which have filled the heads of divers young ladies in this Realm with
      certain new ideas destructive to the peace of mankind, that never entered
      their imagination before.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a case has occurred in Camberwell, in which a young lady informed her
      Papa that 'she intended to ally herself in marriage' with Mr. Smith of
      Stepney; and that another, and a very distressing case, has occurred at
      Tottenham, in which a young lady not only stated her intention of allying
      herself in marriage with her cousin John, but, taking violent possession
      of her said cousin, actually married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That similar outrages are of constant occurrence, not only in the capital
      and its neighbourhood, but throughout the kingdom, and that unless the
      excited female populace be speedily checked and restrained in their
      lawless proceedings, most deplorable results must ensue therefrom; among
      which may be anticipated a most alarming increase in the population of the
      country, with which no efforts of the agricultural or manufacturing
      interest can possibly keep pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there is strong reason to suspect the existence of a most extensive
      plot, conspiracy, or design, secretly contrived by vast numbers of single
      ladies in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and now
      extending its ramifications in every quarter of the land; the object and
      intent of which plainly appears to be the holding and solemnising of an
      enormous and unprecedented number of marriages, on the day on which the
      nuptials of Her said Most Gracious Majesty are performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That such plot, conspiracy, or design, strongly savours of Popery, as
      tending to the discomfiture of the Clergy of the Established Church, by
      entailing upon them great mental and physical exhaustion; and that such
      Popish plots are fomented and encouraged by Her Majesty's Ministers, which
      clearly appears-not only from Her Majesty's principal Secretary of State
      for Foreign Affairs traitorously getting married while holding office
      under the Crown; but from Mr. O'Connell having been heard to declare and
      avow that, if he had a daughter to marry, she should be married on the
      same day as Her said Most Gracious Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      That such arch plots, conspiracies, and designs, besides being fraught
      with danger to the Established Church, and (consequently) to the State,
      cannot fail to bring ruin and bankruptcy upon a large class of Her
      Majesty's subjects; as a great and sudden increase in the number of
      married men occasioning the comparative desertion (for a time) of Taverns,
      Hotels, Billiard-rooms, and Gaming-Houses, will deprive the Proprietors of
      their accustomed profits and returns. And in further proof of the depth
      and baseness of such designs, it may be here observed, that all
      proprietors of Taverns, Hotels, Billiard-rooms, and Gaming-Houses, are
      (especially the last) solemnly devoted to the Protestant religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all these reasons, and many others of no less gravity and import, an
      urgent appeal is made to the gentlemen of England (being bachelors or
      widowers) to take immediate steps for convening a Public meeting; To
      consider of the best and surest means of averting the dangers with which
      they are threatened by the recurrence of Bissextile, or Leap Year, and the
      additional sensation created among single ladies by the terms of Her
      Majesty's Most Gracious Declaration; To take measures, without delay, for
      resisting the said single Ladies, and counteracting their evil designs;
      And to pray Her Majesty to dismiss her present Ministers, and to summon to
      her Councils those distinguished Gentlemen in various Honourable
      Professions who, by insulting on all occasions the only Lady in England
      who can be insulted with safety, have given a sufficient guarantee to Her
      Majesty's Loving Subjects that they, at least, are qualified to make war
      with women, and are already expert in the use of those weapons which are
      common to the lowest and most abandoned of the sex. THE YOUNG COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      There is to be a wedding this morning at the corner house in the terrace.
      The pastry-cook's people have been there half-a-dozen times already; all
      day yesterday there was a great stir and bustle, and they were up this
      morning as soon as it was light. Miss Emma Fielding is going to be married
      to young Mr. Harvey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven alone can tell in what bright colours this marriage is painted upon
      the mind of the little housemaid at number six, who has hardly slept a
      wink all night with thinking of it, and now stands on the unswept
      door-steps leaning upon her broom, and looking wistfully towards the
      enchanted house. Nothing short of omniscience can divine what visions of
      the baker, or the green-grocer, or the smart and most insinuating
      butterman, are flitting across her mind-what thoughts of how she would
      dress on such an occasion, if she were a lady-of how she would dress, if
      she were only a bride-of how cook would dress, being bridesmaid,
      conjointly with her sister 'in place' at Fulham, and how the clergyman,
      deeming them so many ladies, would be quite humbled and respectful. What
      day-dreams of hope and happiness-of life being one perpetual holiday, with
      no master and no mistress to grant or withhold it-of every Sunday being a
      Sunday out-of pure freedom as to curls and ringlets, and no obligation to
      hide fine heads of hair in caps-what pictures of happiness, vast and
      immense to her, but utterly ridiculous to us, bewilder the brain of the
      little housemaid at number six, all called into existence by the wedding
      at the corner!
    </p>
    <p>
      We smile at such things, and so we should, though perhaps for a better
      reason than commonly presents itself. It should be pleasant to us to know
      that there are notions of happiness so moderate and limited, since upon
      those who entertain them, happiness and lightness of heart are very easily
      bestowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the little housemaid is awakened from her reverie, for forth from the
      door of the magical corner house there runs towards her, all fluttering in
      smart new dress and streaming ribands, her friend Jane Adams, who comes
      all out of breath to redeem a solemn promise of taking her in, under cover
      of the confusion, to see the breakfast table spread forth in state,
      and-sight of sights!-her young mistress ready dressed for church.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, in good truth, when they have stolen up-stairs on tip-toe and
      edged themselves in at the chamber-door-there is Miss Emma 'looking like
      the sweetest picter,' in a white chip bonnet and orange flowers, and all
      other elegancies becoming a bride, (with the make, shape, and quality of
      every article of which the girl is perfectly familiar in one moment, and
      never forgets to her dying day)-and there is Miss Emma's mamma in tears,
      and Miss Emma's papa comforting her, and saying how that of course she has
      been long looking forward to this, and how happy she ought to be-and there
      too is Miss Emma's sister with her arms round her neck, and the other
      bridesmaid all smiles and tears, quieting the children, who would cry more
      but that they are so finely dressed, and yet sob for fear sister Emma
      should be taken away-and it is all so affecting, that the two
      servant-girls cry more than anybody; and Jane Adams, sitting down upon the
      stairs, when they have crept away, declares that her legs tremble so that
      she don't know what to do, and that she will say for Miss Emma, that she
      never had a hasty word from her, and that she does hope and pray she may
      be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane soon comes round again, and then surely there never was anything
      like the breakfast table, glittering with plate and china, and set out
      with flowers and sweets, and long-necked bottles, in the most sumptuous
      and dazzling manner. In the centre, too, is the mighty charm, the cake,
      glistening with frosted sugar, and garnished beautifully. They agree that
      there ought to be a little Cupid under one of the barley-sugar temples, or
      at least two hearts and an arrow; but, with this exception, there is
      nothing to wish for, and a table could not be handsomer. As they arrive at
      this conclusion, who should come in but Mr. John! to whom Jane says that
      its only Anne from number six; and John says he knows, for he's often
      winked his eye down the area, which causes Anne to blush and look
      confused. She is going away, indeed; when Mr. John will have it that she
      must drink a glass of wine, and he says never mind it's being early in the
      morning, it won't hurt her: so they shut the door and pour out the wine;
      and Anne drinking lane's health, and adding, 'and here's wishing you
      yours, Mr. John,' drinks it in a great many sips,-Mr. John all the time
      making jokes appropriate to the occasion. At last Mr. John, who has waxed
      bolder by degrees, pleads the usage at weddings, and claims the privilege
      of a kiss, which he obtains after a great scuffle; and footsteps being now
      heard on the stairs, they disperse suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time a carriage has driven up to convey the bride to church, and
      Anne of number six prolonging the process of 'cleaning her door,' has the
      satisfaction of beholding the bride and bridesmaids, and the papa and
      mamma, hurry into the same and drive rapidly off. Nor is this all, for
      soon other carriages begin to arrive with a posse of company all
      beautifully dressed, at whom she could stand and gaze for ever; but having
      something else to do, is compelled to take one last long look and shut the
      street-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the company have gone down to breakfast, and tears have given
      place to smiles, for all the corks are out of the long-necked bottles, and
      their contents are disappearing rapidly. Miss Emma's papa is at the top of
      the table; Miss Emma's mamma at the bottom; and beside the latter are Miss
      Emma herself and her husband,-admitted on all hands to be the handsomest
      and most interesting young couple ever known. All down both sides of the
      table, too, are various young ladies, beautiful to see, and various young
      gentlemen who seem to think so; and there, in a post of honour, is an
      unmarried aunt of Miss Emma's, reported to possess unheard-of riches, and
      to have expressed vast testamentary intentions respecting her favourite
      niece and new nephew. This lady has been very liberal and generous
      already, as the jewels worn by the bride abundantly testify, but that is
      nothing to what she means to do, or even to what she has done, for she put
      herself in close communication with the dressmaker three months ago, and
      prepared a wardrobe (with some articles worked by her own hands) fit for a
      Princess. People may call her an old maid, and so she may be, but she is
      neither cross nor ugly for all that; on the contrary, she is very cheerful
      and pleasant-looking, and very kind and tender-hearted: which is no matter
      of surprise except to those who yield to popular prejudices without
      thinking why, and will never grow wiser and never know better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the company though, none are more pleasant to behold or better
      pleased with themselves than two young children, who, in honour of the
      day, have seats among the guests. Of these, one is a little fellow of six
      or eight years old, brother to the bride,-and the other a girl of the same
      age, or something younger, whom he calls 'his wife.' The real bride and
      bridegroom are not more devoted than they: he all love and attention, and
      she all blushes and fondness, toying with a little bouquet which he gave
      her this morning, and placing the scattered rose- leaves in her bosom with
      nature's own coquettishness. They have dreamt of each other in their quiet
      dreams, these children, and their little hearts have been nearly broken
      when the absent one has been dispraised in jest. When will there come in
      after-life a passion so earnest, generous, and true as theirs; what, even
      in its gentlest realities, can have the grace and charm that hover round
      such fairy lovers!
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the merriment and happiness of the feast have gained their
      height; certain ominous looks begin to be exchanged between the
      bridesmaids, and somehow it gets whispered about that the carriage which
      is to take the young couple into the country has arrived. Such members of
      the party as are most disposed to prolong its enjoyments, affect to
      consider this a false alarm, but it turns out too true, being speedily
      confirmed, first by the retirement of the bride and a select file of
      intimates who are to prepare her for the journey, and secondly by the
      withdrawal of the ladies generally. To this there ensues a particularly
      awkward pause, in which everybody essays to be facetious, and nobody
      succeeds; at length the bridegroom makes a mysterious disappearance in
      obedience to some equally mysterious signal; and the table is deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for at least six weeks last past it has been solemnly devised and
      settled that the young couple should go away in secret; but they no sooner
      appear without the door than the drawing-room windows are blocked up with
      ladies waving their handkerchiefs and kissing their hands, and the
      dining-room panes with gentlemen's faces beaming farewell in every queer
      variety of its expression. The hall and steps are crowded with servants in
      white favours, mixed up with particular friends and relations who have
      darted out to say good-bye; and foremost in the group are the tiny lovers
      arm in arm, thinking, with fluttering hearts, what happiness it would be
      to dash away together in that gallant coach, and never part again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride has barely time for one hurried glance at her old home, when the
      steps rattle, the door slams, the horses clatter on the pavement, and they
      have left it far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knot of women servants still remain clustered in the hall, whispering
      among themselves, and there of course is Anne from number six, who has
      made another escape on some plea or other, and been an admiring witness of
      the departure. There are two points on which Anne expatiates over and over
      again, without the smallest appearance of fatigue or intending to leave
      off; one is, that she 'never see in all her life such a-oh such a angel of
      a gentleman as Mr. Harvey'-and the other, that she 'can't tell how it is,
      but it don't seem a bit like a work-a-day, or a Sunday neither-it's all so
      unsettled and unregular.' THE FORMAL COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      The formal couple are the most prim, cold, immovable, and unsatisfactory
      people on the face of the earth. Their faces, voices, dress, house,
      furniture, walk, and manner, are all the essence of formality, unrelieved
      by one redeeming touch of frankness, heartiness, or nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything with the formal couple resolves itself into a matter of form.
      They don't call upon you on your account, but their own; not to see how
      you are, but to show how they are: it is not a ceremony to do honour to
      you, but to themselves,-not due to your position, but to theirs. If one of
      a friend's children die, the formal couple are as sure and punctual in
      sending to the house as the undertaker; if a friend's family be increased,
      the monthly nurse is not more attentive than they. The formal couple, in
      fact, joyfully seize all occasions of testifying their good-breeding and
      precise observance of the little usages of society; and for you, who are
      the means to this end, they care as much as a man does for the tailor who
      has enabled him to cut a figure, or a woman for the milliner who has
      assisted her to a conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having an extensive connexion among that kind of people who make
      acquaintances and eschew friends, the formal gentleman attends from time
      to time a great many funerals, to which he is formally invited, and to
      which he formally goes, as returning a call for the last time. Here his
      deportment is of the most faultless description; he knows the exact pitch
      of voice it is proper to assume, the sombre look he ought to wear, the
      melancholy tread which should be his gait for the day. He is perfectly
      acquainted with all the dreary courtesies to be observed in a
      mourning-coach; knows when to sigh, and when to hide his nose in the white
      handkerchief; and looks into the grave and shakes his head when the
      ceremony is concluded, with the sad formality of a mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What kind of funeral was it?' says the formal lady, when he returns home.
      'Oh!' replies the formal gentleman, 'there never was such a gross and
      disgusting impropriety; there were no feathers.' 'No feathers!' cries the
      lady, as if on wings of black feathers dead people fly to Heaven, and,
      lacking them, they must of necessity go elsewhere. Her husband shakes his
      head; and further adds, that they had seed-cake instead of plum-cake, and
      that it was all white wine. 'All white wine!' exclaims his wife. 'Nothing
      but sherry and madeira,' says the husband. 'What! no port?' 'Not a drop.'
      No port, no plums, and no feathers! 'You will recollect, my dear,' says
      the formal lady, in a voice of stately reproof, 'that when we first met
      this poor man who is now dead and gone, and he took that very strange
      course of addressing me at dinner without being previously introduced, I
      ventured to express my opinion that the family were quite ignorant of
      etiquette, and very imperfectly acquainted with the decencies of life. You
      have now had a good opportunity of judging for yourself, and all I have to
      say is, that I trust you will never go to a funeral there again.' 'My
      dear,' replies the formal gentleman, 'I never will.' So the informal
      deceased is cut in his grave; and the formal couple, when they tell the
      story of the funeral, shake their heads, and wonder what some people's
      feelings are made of, and what their notions of propriety can be!
    </p>
    <p>
      If the formal couple have a family (which they sometimes have), they are
      not children, but little, pale, sour, sharp-nosed men and women; and so
      exquisitely brought up, that they might be very old dwarfs for anything
      that appeareth to the contrary. Indeed, they are so acquainted with forms
      and conventionalities, and conduct themselves with such strict decorum,
      that to see the little girl break a looking-glass in some wild outbreak,
      or the little boy kick his parents, would be to any visitor an unspeakable
      relief and consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formal couple are always sticklers for what is rigidly proper, and
      have a great readiness in detecting hidden impropriety of speech or
      thought, which by less scrupulous people would be wholly unsuspected.
      Thus, if they pay a visit to the theatre, they sit all night in a perfect
      agony lest anything improper or immoral should proceed from the stage; and
      if anything should happen to be said which admits of a double
      construction, they never fail to take it up directly, and to express by
      their looks the great outrage which their feelings have sustained. Perhaps
      this is their chief reason for absenting themselves almost entirely from
      places of public amusement. They go sometimes to the Exhibition of the
      Royal Academy;-but that is often more shocking than the stage itself, and
      the formal lady thinks that it really is high time Mr. Etty was prosecuted
      and made a public example of.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made one at a christening party not long since, where there were
      amongst the guests a formal couple, who suffered the acutest torture from
      certain jokes, incidental to such an occasion, cut-and very likely dried
      also-by one of the godfathers; a red-faced elderly gentleman, who, being
      highly popular with the rest of the company, had it all his own way, and
      was in great spirits. It was at supper-time that this gentleman came out
      in full force. We-being of a grave and quiet demeanour-had been chosen to
      escort the formal lady down-stairs, and, sitting beside her, had a
      favourable opportunity of observing her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a shrewd suspicion that, in the very beginning, and in the first
      blush-literally the first blush-of the matter, the formal lady had not
      felt quite certain whether the being present at such a ceremony, and
      encouraging, as it were, the public exhibition of a baby, was not an act
      involving some degree of indelicacy and impropriety; but certain we are
      that when that baby's health was drunk, and allusions were made, by a
      grey-headed gentleman proposing it, to the time when he had dandled in his
      arms the young Christian's mother,-certain we are that then the formal
      lady took the alarm, and recoiled from the old gentleman as from a hoary
      profligate. Still she bore it; she fanned herself with an indignant air,
      but still she bore it. A comic song was sung, involving a confession from
      some imaginary gentleman that he had kissed a female, and yet the formal
      lady bore it. But when at last, the health of the godfather
      before-mentioned being drunk, the godfather rose to return thanks, and in
      the course of his observations darkly hinted at babies yet unborn, and
      even contemplated the possibility of the subject of that festival having
      brothers and sisters, the formal lady could endure no more, but, bowing
      slightly round, and sweeping haughtily past the offender, left the room in
      tears, under the protection of the formal gentleman. THE LOVING COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      There cannot be a better practical illustration of the wise saw and
      ancient instance, that there may be too much of a good thing, than is
      presented by a loving couple. Undoubtedly it is meet and proper that two
      persons joined together in holy matrimony should be loving, and
      unquestionably it is pleasant to know and see that they are so; but there
      is a time for all things, and the couple who happen to be always in a
      loving state before company, are well-nigh intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in taking up this position we would have it distinctly understood that
      we do not seek alone the sympathy of bachelors, in whose objection to
      loving couples we recognise interested motives and personal
      considerations. We grant that to that unfortunate class of society there
      may be something very irritating, tantalising, and provoking, in being
      compelled to witness those gentle endearments and chaste interchanges
      which to loving couples are quite the ordinary business of life. But while
      we recognise the natural character of the prejudice to which these unhappy
      men are subject, we can neither receive their biassed evidence, nor
      address ourself to their inflamed and angered minds. Dispassionate
      experience is our only guide; and in these moral essays we seek no less to
      reform hymeneal offenders than to hold out a timely warning to all rising
      couples, and even to those who have not yet set forth upon their
      pilgrimage towards the matrimonial market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let all couples, present or to come, therefore profit by the example of
      Mr. and Mrs. Leaver, themselves a loving couple in the first degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Leaver are pronounced by Mrs. Starling, a widow lady who lost
      her husband when she was young, and lost herself about the same- time-for
      by her own count she has never since grown five years older-to be a
      perfect model of wedded felicity. 'You would suppose,' says the romantic
      lady, 'that they were lovers only just now engaged. Never was such
      happiness! They are so tender, so affectionate, so attached to each other,
      so enamoured, that positively nothing can be more charming!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Augusta, my soul,' says Mr. Leaver. 'Augustus, my life,' replies Mrs.
      Leaver. 'Sing some little ballad, darling,' quoth Mr. Leaver. 'I couldn't,
      indeed, dearest,' returns Mrs. Leaver. 'Do, my dove,' says Mr. Leaver. 'I
      couldn't possibly, my love,' replies Mrs. Leaver; 'and it's very naughty
      of you to ask me.' 'Naughty, darling!' cries Mr. Leaver. 'Yes, very
      naughty, and very cruel,' returns Mrs. Leaver, 'for you know I have a sore
      throat, and that to sing would give me great pain. You're a monster, and I
      hate you. Go away!' Mrs. Leaver has said 'go away,' because Mr. Leaver has
      tapped her under the chin: Mr. Leaver not doing as he is bid, but on the
      contrary, sitting down beside her, Mrs. Leaver slaps Mr. Leaver; and Mr.
      Leaver in return slaps Mrs. Leaver, and it being now time for all persons
      present to look the other way, they look the other way, and hear a still
      small sound as of kissing, at which Mrs. Starling is thoroughly
      enraptured, and whispers her neighbour that if all married couples were
      like that, what a heaven this earth would be!
    </p>
    <p>
      The loving couple are at home when this occurs, and maybe only three or
      four friends are present, but, unaccustomed to reserve upon this
      interesting point, they are pretty much the same abroad. Indeed upon some
      occasions, such as a pic-nic or a water-party, their lovingness is even
      more developed, as we had an opportunity last summer of observing in
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great water-party made up to go to Twickenham and dine, and
      afterwards dance in an empty villa by the river-side, hired expressly for
      the purpose. Mr. and Mrs. Leaver were of the company; and it was our
      fortune to have a seat in the same boat, which was an eight-oared galley,
      manned by amateurs, with a blue striped awning of the same pattern as
      their Guernsey shirts, and a dingy red flag of the same shade as the
      whiskers of the stroke oar. A coxswain being appointed, and all other
      matters adjusted, the eight gentlemen threw themselves into strong
      paroxysms, and pulled up with the tide, stimulated by the compassionate
      remarks of the ladies, who one and all exclaimed, that it seemed an
      immense exertion-as indeed it did. At first we raced the other boat, which
      came alongside in gallant style; but this being found an unpleasant
      amusement, as giving rise to a great quantity of splashing, and rendering
      the cold pies and other viands very moist, it was unanimously voted down,
      and we were suffered to shoot a-head, while the second boat followed
      ingloriously in our wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this time that we first recognised Mr. Leaver. There were two
      firemen-watermen in the boat, lying by until somebody was exhausted; and
      one of them, who had taken upon himself the direction of affairs, was
      heard to cry in a gruff voice, 'Pull away, number two-give it her, number
      two-take a longer reach, number two-now, number two, sir, think you're
      winning a boat.' The greater part of the company had no doubt begun to
      wonder which of the striped Guernseys it might be that stood in need of
      such encouragement, when a stifled shriek from Mrs. Leaver confirmed the
      doubtful and informed the ignorant; and Mr. Leaver, still further
      disguised in a straw hat and no neckcloth, was observed to be in a fearful
      perspiration, and failing visibly. Nor was the general consternation
      diminished at this instant by the same gentleman (in the performance of an
      accidental aquatic feat, termed 'catching a crab') plunging suddenly
      backward, and displaying nothing of himself to the company, but two
      violently struggling legs. Mrs. Leaver shrieked again several times, and
      cried piteously-'Is he dead? Tell me the worst. Is he dead?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, a moment's reflection might have convinced the loving wife, that
      unless her husband were endowed with some most surprising powers of
      muscular action, he never could be dead while he kicked so hard; but still
      Mrs. Leaver cried, 'Is he dead? is he dead?' and still everybody else
      cried-'No, no, no,' until such time as Mr. Leaver was replaced in a
      sitting posture, and his oar (which had been going through all kinds of
      wrong-headed performances on its own account) was once more put in his
      hand, by the exertions of the two firemen-watermen. Mr. Leaver then
      exclaimed, 'Augustus, my child, come to me;' and Mr. Leaver said,
      'Augusta, my love, compose yourself, I am not injured.' But Mrs. Leaver
      cried again more piteously than before, 'Augustus, my child, come to me;'
      and now the company generally, who seemed to be apprehensive that if Mr.
      Leaver remained where he was, he might contribute more than his proper
      share towards the drowning of the party, disinterestedly took part with
      Mrs. Leaver, and said he really ought to go, and that he was not strong
      enough for such violent exercise, and ought never to have undertaken it.
      Reluctantly, Mr. Leaver went, and laid himself down at Mrs. Leaver's feet,
      and Mrs. Leaver stooping over him, said, 'Oh Augustus, how could you
      terrify me so?' and Mr. Leaver said, 'Augusta, my sweet, I never meant to
      terrify you;' and Mrs. Leaver said, 'You are faint, my dear;' and Mr.
      Leaver said, 'I am rather so, my love;' and they were very loving indeed
      under Mrs. Leaver's veil, until at length Mr. Leaver came forth again, and
      pleasantly asked if he had not heard something said about bottled stout
      and sandwiches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Starling, who was one of the party, was perfectly delighted with this
      scene, and frequently murmured half-aside, 'What a loving couple you are!'
      or 'How delightful it is to see man and wife so happy together!' To us she
      was quite poetical, (for we are a kind of cousins,) observing that hearts
      beating in unison like that made life a paradise of sweets; and that when
      kindred creatures were drawn together by sympathies so fine and delicate,
      what more than mortal happiness did not our souls partake! To all this we
      answered 'Certainly,' or 'Very true,' or merely sighed, as the case might
      be. At every new act of the loving couple, the widow's admiration broke
      out afresh; and when Mrs. Leaver would not permit Mr. Leaver to keep his
      hat off, lest the sun should strike to his head, and give him a brain
      fever, Mrs. Starling actually shed tears, and said it reminded her of Adam
      and Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loving couple were thus loving all the way to Twickenham, but when we
      arrived there (by which time the amateur crew looked very thirsty and
      vicious) they were more playful than ever, for Mrs. Leaver threw stones at
      Mr. Leaver, and Mr. Leaver ran after Mrs. Leaver on the grass, in a most
      innocent and enchanting manner. At dinner, too, Mr. Leaver would steal
      Mrs. Leaver's tongue, and Mrs. Leaver would retaliate upon Mr. Leaver's
      fowl; and when Mrs. Leaver was going to take some lobster salad, Mr.
      Leaver wouldn't let her have any, saying that it made her ill, and she was
      always sorry for it afterwards, which afforded Mrs. Leaver an opportunity
      of pretending to be cross, and showing many other prettinesses. But this
      was merely the smiling surface of their loves, not the mighty depths of
      the stream, down to which the company, to say the truth, dived rather
      unexpectedly, from the following accident. It chanced that Mr. Leaver took
      upon himself to propose the bachelors who had first originated the notion
      of that entertainment, in doing which, he affected to regret that he was
      no longer of their body himself, and pretended grievously to lament his
      fallen state. This Mrs. Leaver's feelings could not brook, even in jest,
      and consequently, exclaiming aloud, 'He loves me not, he loves me not!'
      she fell in a very pitiable state into the arms of Mrs. Starling, and,
      directly becoming insensible, was conveyed by that lady and her husband
      into another room. Presently Mr. Leaver came running back to know if there
      was a medical gentleman in company, and as there was, (in what company is
      there not?) both Mr. Leaver and the medical gentleman hurried away
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical gentleman was the first who returned, and among his intimate
      friends he was observed to laugh and wink, and look as unmedical as might
      be; but when Mr. Leaver came back he was very solemn, and in answer to all
      inquiries, shook his head, and remarked that Augusta was far too sensitive
      to be trifled with-an opinion which the widow subsequently confirmed.
      Finding that she was in no imminent peril, however, the rest of the party
      betook themselves to dancing on the green, and very merry and happy they
      were, and a vast quantity of flirtation there was; the last circumstance
      being no doubt attributable, partly to the fineness of the weather, and
      partly to the locality, which is well known to be favourable to all
      harmless recreations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bustle of the scene, Mr. and Mrs. Leaver stole down to the boat,
      and disposed themselves under the awning, Mrs. Leaver reclining her head
      upon Mr. Leaver's shoulder, and Mr. Leaver grasping her hand with great
      fervour, and looking in her face from time to time with a melancholy and
      sympathetic aspect. The widow sat apart, feigning to be occupied with a
      book, but stealthily observing them from behind her fan; and the two
      firemen-watermen, smoking their pipes on the bank hard by, nudged each
      other, and grinned in enjoyment of the joke. Very few of the party missed
      the loving couple; and the few who did, heartily congratulated each other
      on their disappearance. THE CONTRADICTORY COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      One would suppose that two people who are to pass their whole lives
      together, and must necessarily be very often alone with each other, could
      find little pleasure in mutual contradiction; and yet what is more common
      than a contradictory couple?
    </p>
    <p>
      The contradictory couple agree in nothing but contradiction. They return
      home from Mrs. Bluebottle's dinner-party, each in an opposite corner of
      the coach, and do not exchange a syllable until they have been seated for
      at least twenty minutes by the fireside at home, when the gentleman,
      raising his eyes from the stove, all at once breaks silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a very extraordinary thing it is,' says he, 'that you will
      contradict, Charlotte!' 'I contradict!' cries the lady, 'but that's just
      like you.' 'What's like me?' says the gentleman sharply. 'Saying that I
      contradict you,' replies the lady. 'Do you mean to say that you do not
      contradict me?' retorts the gentleman; 'do you mean to say that you have
      not been contradicting me the whole of this day?' 'Do you mean to tell me
      now, that you have not? I mean to tell you nothing of the kind,' replies
      the lady quietly; 'when you are wrong, of course I shall contradict you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      During this dialogue the gentleman has been taking his brandy-and-water on
      one side of the fire, and the lady, with her dressing-case on the table,
      has been curling her hair on the other. She now lets down her back hair,
      and proceeds to brush it; preserving at the same time an air of conscious
      rectitude and suffering virtue, which is intended to exasperate the
      gentleman-and does so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do believe,' he says, taking the spoon out of his glass, and tossing it
      on the table, 'that of all the obstinate, positive, wrong-headed creatures
      that were ever born, you are the most so, Charlotte.' 'Certainly,
      certainly, have it your own way, pray. You see how much I contradict you,'
      rejoins the lady. 'Of course, you didn't contradict me at dinner-time-oh
      no, not you!' says the gentleman. 'Yes, I did,' says the lady. 'Oh, you
      did,' cries the gentleman 'you admit that?' 'If you call that
      contradiction, I do,' the lady answers; 'and I say again, Edward, that
      when I know you are wrong, I will contradict you. I am not your slave.'
      'Not my slave!' repeats the gentleman bitterly; 'and you still mean to say
      that in the Blackburns' new house there are not more than fourteen doors,
      including the door of the wine-cellar!' 'I mean to say,' retorts the lady,
      beating time with her hair-brush on the palm of her hand, 'that in that
      house there are fourteen doors and no more.' 'Well then-' cries the
      gentleman, rising in despair, and pacing the room with rapid strides. 'By
      G-, this is enough to destroy a man's intellect, and drive him mad!'
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the gentleman comes-to a little, and passing his hand gloomily
      across his forehead, reseats himself in his former chair. There is a long
      silence, and this time the lady begins. 'I appealed to Mr. Jenkins, who
      sat next to me on the sofa in the drawing-room during tea-' 'Morgan, you
      mean,' interrupts the gentleman. 'I do not mean anything of the kind,'
      answers the lady. 'Now, by all that is aggravating and impossible to
      bear,' cries the gentleman, clenching his hands and looking upwards in
      agony, 'she is going to insist upon it that Morgan is Jenkins!' 'Do you
      take me for a perfect fool?' exclaims the lady; 'do you suppose I don't
      know the one from the other? Do you suppose I don't know that the man in
      the blue coat was Mr. Jenkins?' 'Jenkins in a blue coat!' cries the
      gentleman with a groan; 'Jenkins in a blue coat! a man who would suffer
      death rather than wear anything but brown!' 'Do you dare to charge me with
      telling an untruth?' demands the lady, bursting into tears. 'I charge you,
      ma'am,' retorts the gentleman, starting up, 'with being a monster of
      contradiction, a monster of aggravation, a-a-a-Jenkins in a blue
      coat!-what have I done that I should be doomed to hear such statements!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Expressing himself with great scorn and anguish, the gentleman takes up
      his candle and stalks off to bed, where feigning to be fast asleep when
      the lady comes up-stairs drowned in tears, murmuring lamentations over her
      hard fate and indistinct intentions of consulting her brothers, he
      undergoes the secret torture of hearing her exclaim between whiles, 'I
      know there are only fourteen doors in the house, I know it was Mr.
      Jenkins, I know he had a blue coat on, and I would say it as positively as
      I do now, if they were the last words I had to speak!'
    </p>
    <p>
      If the contradictory couple are blessed with children, they are not the
      less contradictory on that account. Master James and Miss Charlotte
      present themselves after dinner, and being in perfect good humour, and
      finding their parents in the same amiable state, augur from these
      appearances half a glass of wine a-piece and other extraordinary
      indulgences. But unfortunately Master James, growing talkative upon such
      prospects, asks his mamma how tall Mrs. Parsons is, and whether she is not
      six feet high; to which his mamma replies, 'Yes, she should think she was,
      for Mrs. Parsons is a very tall lady indeed; quite a giantess.' 'For
      Heaven's sake, Charlotte,' cries her husband, 'do not tell the child such
      preposterous nonsense. Six feet high!' 'Well,' replies the lady, 'surely I
      may be permitted to have an opinion; my opinion is, that she is six feet
      high-at least six feet.' 'Now you know, Charlotte,' retorts the gentleman
      sternly, 'that that is not your opinion-that you have no such idea-and
      that you only say this for the sake of contradiction.' 'You are
      exceedingly polite,' his wife replies; 'to be wrong about such a paltry
      question as anybody's height, would be no great crime; but I say again,
      that I believe Mrs. Parsons to be six feet-more than six feet; nay, I
      believe you know her to be full six feet, and only say she is not, because
      I say she is.' This taunt disposes the gentleman to become violent, but he
      cheeks himself, and is content to mutter, in a haughty tone, 'Six feet-ha!
      ha! Mrs. Parsons six feet!' and the lady answers, 'Yes, six feet. I am
      sure I am glad you are amused, and I'll say it again-six feet.' Thus the
      subject gradually drops off, and the contradiction begins to be forgotten,
      when Master James, with some undefined notion of making himself agreeable,
      and putting things to rights again, unfortunately asks his mamma what the
      moon's made of; which gives her occasion to say that he had better not ask
      her, for she is always wrong and never can be right; that he only exposes
      her to contradiction by asking any question of her; and that he had better
      ask his papa, who is infallible, and never can be wrong. Papa, smarting
      under this attack, gives a terrible pull at the bell, and says, that if
      the conversation is to proceed in this way, the children had better be
      removed. Removed they are, after a few tears and many struggles; and Pa
      having looked at Ma sideways for a minute or two, with a baleful eye,
      draws his pocket-handkerchief over his face, and composes himself for his
      after-dinner nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends of the contradictory couple often deplore their frequent
      disputes, though they rather make light of them at the same time:
      observing, that there is no doubt they are very much attached to each
      other, and that they never quarrel except about trifles. But neither the
      friends of the contradictory couple, nor the contradictory couple
      themselves, reflect, that as the most stupendous objects in nature are but
      vast collections of minute particles, so the slightest and least
      considered trifles make up the sum of human happiness or misery. THE
      COUPLE WHO DOTE UPON THEIR CHILDREN
    </p>
    <p>
      The couple who dote upon their children have usually a great many of them:
      six or eight at least. The children are either the healthiest in all the
      world, or the most unfortunate in existence. In either case, they are
      equally the theme of their doting parents, and equally a source of mental
      anguish and irritation to their doting parents' friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The couple who dote upon their children recognise no dates but those
      connected with their births, accidents, illnesses, or remarkable deeds.
      They keep a mental almanack with a vast number of Innocents'-days, all in
      red letters. They recollect the last coronation, because on that day
      little Tom fell down the kitchen stairs; the anniversary of the Gunpowder
      Plot, because it was on the fifth of November that Ned asked whether
      wooden legs were made in heaven and cocked hats grew in gardens. Mrs.
      Whiffler will never cease to recollect the last day of the old year as
      long as she lives, for it was on that day that the baby had the four red
      spots on its nose which they took for measles: nor Christmas-day, for
      twenty-one days after Christmas-day the twins were born; nor Good Friday,
      for it was on a Good Friday that she was frightened by the donkey-cart
      when she was in the family way with Georgiana. The movable feasts have no
      motion for Mr. and Mrs. Whiffler, but remain pinned down tight and fast to
      the shoulders of some small child, from whom they can never be separated
      any more. Time was made, according to their creed, not for slaves but for
      girls and boys; the restless sands in his glass are but little children at
      play.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have already intimated, the children of this couple can know no
      medium. They are either prodigies of good health or prodigies of bad
      health; whatever they are, they must be prodigies. Mr. Whiffler must have
      to describe at his office such excruciating agonies constantly undergone
      by his eldest boy, as nobody else's eldest boy ever underwent; or he must
      be able to declare that there never was a child endowed with such amazing
      health, such an indomitable constitution, and such a cast- iron frame, as
      his child. His children must be, in some respect or other, above and
      beyond the children of all other people. To such an extent is this feeling
      pushed, that we were once slightly acquainted with a lady and gentleman
      who carried their heads so high and became so proud after their youngest
      child fell out of a two-pair-of-stairs window without hurting himself
      much, that the greater part of their friends were obliged to forego their
      acquaintance. But perhaps this may be an extreme case, and one not justly
      entitled to be considered as a precedent of general application.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a friend happen to dine in a friendly way with one of these couples who
      dote upon their children, it is nearly impossible for him to divert the
      conversation from their favourite topic. Everything reminds Mr. Whiffler
      of Ned, or Mrs. Whiffler of Mary Anne, or of the time before Ned was born,
      or the time before Mary Anne was thought of. The slightest remark, however
      harmless in itself, will awaken slumbering recollections of the twins. It
      is impossible to steer clear of them. They will come uppermost, let the
      poor man do what he may. Ned has been known to be lost sight of for half
      an hour, Dick has been forgotten, the name of Mary Anne has not been
      mentioned, but the twins will out. Nothing can keep down the twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's a very extraordinary thing, Saunders,' says Mr. Whiffler to the
      visitor, 'but-you have seen our little babies, the-the-twins?' The
      friend's heart sinks within him as he answers, 'Oh, yes-often.' 'Your
      talking of the Pyramids,' says Mr. Whiffler, quite as a matter of course,
      'reminds me of the twins. It's a very extraordinary thing about those
      babies-what colour should you say their eyes were?' 'Upon my word,' the
      friend stammers, 'I hardly know how to answer'-the fact being, that except
      as the friend does not remember to have heard of any departure from the
      ordinary course of nature in the instance of these twins, they might have
      no eyes at all for aught he has observed to the contrary. 'You wouldn't
      say they were red, I suppose?' says Mr. Whiffler. The friend hesitates,
      and rather thinks they are; but inferring from the expression of Mr.
      Whiffler's face that red is not the colour, smiles with some confidence,
      and says, 'No, no! very different from that.' 'What should you say to
      blue?' says Mr. Whiffler. The friend glances at him, and observing a
      different expression in his face, ventures to say, 'I should say they were
      blue-a decided blue.' 'To be sure!' cries Mr. Whiffler, triumphantly, 'I
      knew you would! But what should you say if I was to tell you that the
      boy's eyes are blue and the girl's hazel, eh?' 'Impossible!' exclaims the
      friend, not at all knowing why it should be impossible. 'A fact,
      notwithstanding,' cries Mr. Whiffler; 'and let me tell you, Saunders,
      that's not a common thing in twins, or a circumstance that'll happen every
      day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dialogue Mrs. Whiffler, as being deeply responsible for the twins,
      their charms and singularities, has taken no share; but she now relates,
      in broken English, a witticism of little Dick's bearing upon the subject
      just discussed, which delights Mr. Whiffler beyond measure, and causes him
      to declare that he would have sworn that was Dick's if he had heard it
      anywhere. Then he requests that Mrs. Whiffler will tell Saunders what Tom
      said about mad bulls; and Mrs. Whiffler relating the anecdote, a
      discussion ensues upon the different character of Tom's wit and Dick's
      wit, from which it appears that Dick's humour is of a lively turn, while
      Tom's style is the dry and caustic. This discussion being enlivened by
      various illustrations, lasts a long time, and is only stopped by Mrs.
      Whiffler instructing the footman to ring the nursery bell, as the children
      were promised that they should come down and taste the pudding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friend turns pale when this order is given, and paler still when it is
      followed up by a great pattering on the staircase, (not unlike the sound
      of rain upon a skylight,) a violent bursting open of the dining- room
      door, and the tumultuous appearance of six small children, closely
      succeeded by a strong nursery-maid with a twin in each arm. As the whole
      eight are screaming, shouting, or kicking-some influenced by a ravenous
      appetite, some by a horror of the stranger, and some by a conflict of the
      two feelings-a pretty long space elapses before all their heads can be
      ranged round the table and anything like order restored; in bringing about
      which happy state of things both the nurse and footman are severely
      scratched. At length Mrs. Whiffler is heard to say, 'Mr. Saunders, shall I
      give you some pudding?' A breathless silence ensues, and sixteen small
      eyes are fixed upon the guest in expectation of his reply. A wild shout of
      joy proclaims that he has said 'No, thank you.' Spoons are waved in the
      air, legs appear above the table-cloth in uncontrollable ecstasy, and
      eighty short fingers dabble in damson syrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the pudding is being disposed of, Mr. and Mrs. Whiffler look on with
      beaming countenances, and Mr. Whiffler nudging his friend Saunders, begs
      him to take notice of Tom's eyes, or Dick's chin, or Ned's nose, or Mary
      Anne's hair, or Emily's figure, or little Bob's calves, or Fanny's mouth,
      or Carry's head, as the case may be. Whatever the attention of Mr.
      Saunders is called to, Mr. Saunders admires of course; though he is rather
      confused about the sex of the youngest branches and looks at the wrong
      children, turning to a girl when Mr. Whiffler directs his attention to a
      boy, and falling into raptures with a boy when he ought to be enchanted
      with a girl. Then the dessert comes, and there is a vast deal of
      scrambling after fruit, and sudden spirting forth of juice out of tight
      oranges into infant eyes, and much screeching and wailing in consequence.
      At length it becomes time for Mrs. Whiffler to retire, and all the
      children are by force of arms compelled to kiss and love Mr. Saunders
      before going up-stairs, except Tom, who, lying on his back in the hall,
      proclaims that Mr. Saunders 'is a naughty beast;' and Dick, who having
      drunk his father's wine when he was looking another way, is found to be
      intoxicated and is carried out, very limp and helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Whiffler and his friend are left alone together, but Mr. Whiffler's
      thoughts are still with his family, if his family are not with him.
      'Saunders,' says he, after a short silence, 'if you please, we'll drink
      Mrs. Whiffler and the children.' Mr. Saunders feels this to be a reproach
      against himself for not proposing the same sentiment, and drinks it in
      some confusion. 'Ah!' Mr. Whiffler sighs, 'these children, Saunders, make
      one quite an old man.' Mr. Saunders thinks that if they were his, they
      would make him a very old man; but he says nothing. 'And yet,' pursues Mr.
      Whiffler, 'what can equal domestic happiness? what can equal the engaging
      ways of children! Saunders, why don't you get married?' Now, this is an
      embarrassing question, because Mr. Saunders has been thinking that if he
      had at any time entertained matrimonial designs, the revelation of that
      day would surely have routed them for ever. 'I am glad, however,' says Mr.
      Whiffler, 'that you are a bachelor,-glad on one account, Saunders; a
      selfish one, I admit. Will you do Mrs. Whiffler and myself a favour?' Mr.
      Saunders is surprised-evidently surprised; but he replies, 'with the
      greatest pleasure.' 'Then, will you, Saunders,' says Mr. Whiffler, in an
      impressive manner, 'will you cement and consolidate our friendship by
      coming into the family (so to speak) as a godfather?' 'I shall be proud
      and delighted,' replies Mr. Saunders: 'which of the children is it?
      really, I thought they were all christened; or-' 'Saunders,' Mr. Whiffler
      interposes, 'they are all christened; you are right. The fact is, that
      Mrs. Whiffler is-in short, we expect another.' 'Not a ninth!' cries the
      friend, all aghast at the idea. 'Yes, Saunders,' rejoins Mr. Whiffler,
      solemnly, 'a ninth. Did we drink Mrs. Whiffler's health? Let us drink it
      again, Saunders, and wish her well over it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Johnson used to tell a story of a man who had but one idea, which
      was a wrong one. The couple who dote upon their children are in the same
      predicament: at home or abroad, at all times, and in all places, their
      thoughts are bound up in this one subject, and have no sphere beyond. They
      relate the clever things their offspring say or do, and weary every
      company with their prolixity and absurdity. Mr. Whiffler takes a friend by
      the button at a street corner on a windy day to tell him a bon mot of his
      youngest boy's; and Mrs. Whiffler, calling to see a sick acquaintance,
      entertains her with a cheerful account of all her own past sufferings and
      present expectations. In such cases the sins of the fathers indeed descend
      upon the children; for people soon come to regard them as predestined
      little bores. The couple who dote upon their children cannot be said to be
      actuated by a general love for these engaging little people (which would
      be a great excuse); for they are apt to underrate and entertain a jealousy
      of any children but their own. If they examined their own hearts, they
      would, perhaps, find at the bottom of all this, more self-love and egotism
      than they think of. Self-love and egotism are bad qualities, of which the
      unrestrained exhibition, though it may be sometimes amusing, never fails
      to be wearisome and unpleasant. Couples who dote upon their children,
      therefore, are best avoided. THE COOL COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an old-fashioned weather-glass representing a house with two
      doorways, in one of which is the figure of a gentleman, in the other the
      figure of a lady. When the weather is to be fine the lady comes out and
      the gentleman goes in; when wet, the gentleman comes out and the lady goes
      in. They never seek each other's society, are never elevated and depressed
      by the same cause, and have nothing in common. They are the model of a
      cool couple, except that there is something of politeness and
      consideration about the behaviour of the gentleman in the weather-glass,
      in which, neither of the cool couple can be said to participate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool couple are seldom alone together, and when they are, nothing can
      exceed their apathy and dulness: the gentleman being for the most part
      drowsy, and the lady silent. If they enter into conversation, it is
      usually of an ironical or recriminatory nature. Thus, when the gentleman
      has indulged in a very long yawn and settled himself more snugly in his
      easy-chair, the lady will perhaps remark, 'Well, I am sure, Charles! I
      hope you're comfortable.' To which the gentleman replies, 'Oh yes, he's
      quite comfortable quite.' 'There are not many married men, I hope,'
      returns the lady, 'who seek comfort in such selfish gratifications as you
      do.' 'Nor many wives who seek comfort in such selfish gratifications as
      you do, I hope,' retorts the gentleman. 'Whose fault is that?' demands the
      lady. The gentleman becoming more sleepy, returns no answer. 'Whose fault
      is that?' the lady repeats. The gentleman still returning no answer, she
      goes on to say that she believes there never was in all this world anybody
      so attached to her home, so thoroughly domestic, so unwilling to seek a
      moment's gratification or pleasure beyond her own fireside as she. God
      knows that before she was married she never thought or dreamt of such a
      thing; and she remembers that her poor papa used to say again and again,
      almost every day of his life, 'Oh, my dear Louisa, if you only marry a man
      who understands you, and takes the trouble to consider your happiness and
      accommodate himself a very little to your disposition, what a treasure he
      will find in you!' She supposes her papa knew what her disposition was-he
      had known her long enough-he ought to have been acquainted with it, but
      what can she do? If her home is always dull and lonely, and her husband is
      always absent and finds no pleasure in her society, she is naturally
      sometimes driven (seldom enough, she is sure) to seek a little recreation
      elsewhere; she is not expected to pine and mope to death, she hopes. 'Then
      come, Louisa,' says the gentleman, waking up as suddenly as he fell
      asleep, 'stop at home this evening, and so will I.' 'I should be sorry to
      suppose, Charles, that you took a pleasure in aggravating me,' replies the
      lady; 'but you know as well as I do that I am particularly engaged to Mrs.
      Mortimer, and that it would be an act of the grossest rudeness and
      ill-breeding, after accepting a seat in her box and preventing her from
      inviting anybody else, not to go.' 'Ah! there it is!' says the gentleman,
      shrugging his shoulders, 'I knew that perfectly well. I knew you couldn't
      devote an evening to your own home. Now all I have to say, Louisa, is
      this-recollect that I was quite willing to stay at home, and that it's no
      fault of mine we are not oftener together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With that the gentleman goes away to keep an old appointment at his club,
      and the lady hurries off to dress for Mrs. Mortimer's; and neither thinks
      of the other until by some odd chance they find themselves alone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it must not be supposed that the cool couple are habitually a
      quarrelsome one. Quite the contrary. These differences are only occasions
      for a little self-excuse,-nothing more. In general they are as easy and
      careless, and dispute as seldom, as any common acquaintances may; for it
      is neither worth their while to put each other out of the way, nor to
      ruffle themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they meet in society, the cool couple are the best-bred people in
      existence. The lady is seated in a corner among a little knot of lady
      friends, one of whom exclaims, 'Why, I vow and declare there is your
      husband, my dear!' 'Whose?-mine?' she says, carelessly. 'Ay, yours, and
      coming this way too.' 'How very odd!' says the lady, in a languid tone, 'I
      thought he had been at Dover.' The gentleman coming up, and speaking to
      all the other ladies and nodding slightly to his wife, it turns out that
      he has been at Dover, and has just now returned. 'What a strange creature
      you are!' cries his wife; 'and what on earth brought you here, I wonder?'
      'I came to look after you, of course,' rejoins her husband. This is so
      pleasant a jest that the lady is mightily amused, as are all the other
      ladies similarly situated who are within hearing; and while they are
      enjoying it to the full, the gentleman nods again, turns upon his heel,
      and saunters away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are times, however, when his company is not so agreeable, though
      equally unexpected; such as when the lady has invited one or two
      particular friends to tea and scandal, and he happens to come home in the
      very midst of their diversion. It is a hundred chances to one that he
      remains in the house half an hour, but the lady is rather disturbed by the
      intrusion, notwithstanding, and reasons within herself,-'I am sure I never
      interfere with him, and why should he interfere with me? It can scarcely
      be accidental; it never happens that I have a particular reason for not
      wishing him to come home, but he always comes. It's very provoking and
      tiresome; and I am sure when he leaves me so much alone for his own
      pleasure, the least he could do would be to do as much for mine.'
      Observing what passes in her mind, the gentleman, who has come home for
      his own accommodation, makes a merit of it with himself; arrives at the
      conclusion that it is the very last place in which he can hope to be
      comfortable; and determines, as he takes up his hat and cane, never to be
      so virtuous again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus a great many cool couples go on until they are cold couples, and the
      grave has closed over their folly and indifference. Loss of name, station,
      character, life itself, has ensued from causes as slight as these, before
      now; and when gossips tell such tales, and aggravate their deformities,
      they elevate their hands and eyebrows, and call each other to witness what
      a cool couple Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so always were, even in the best of
      times. THE PLAUSIBLE COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      The plausible couple have many titles. They are 'a delightful couple,' an
      'affectionate couple,' 'a most agreeable couple, 'a good-hearted couple,'
      and 'the best-natured couple in existence.' The truth is, that the
      plausible couple are people of the world; and either the way of pleasing
      the world has grown much easier than it was in the days of the old man and
      his ass, or the old man was but a bad hand at it, and knew very little of
      the trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But is it really possible to please the world!' says some doubting
      reader. It is indeed. Nay, it is not only very possible, but very easy.
      The ways are crooked, and sometimes foul and low. What then? A man need
      but crawl upon his hands and knees, know when to close his eyes and when
      his ears, when to stoop and when to stand upright; and if by the world is
      meant that atom of it in which he moves himself, he shall please it, never
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it will be readily seen, that if a plausible man or woman have an
      easy means of pleasing the world by an adaptation of self to all its
      twistings and twinings, a plausible man and woman, or, in other words, a
      plausible couple, playing into each other's hands, and acting in concert,
      have a manifest advantage. Hence it is that plausible couples scarcely
      ever fail of success on a pretty large scale; and hence it is that if the
      reader, laying down this unwieldy volume at the next full stop, will have
      the goodness to review his or her circle of acquaintance, and to search
      particularly for some man and wife with a large connexion and a good name,
      not easily referable to their abilities or their wealth, he or she (that
      is, the male or female reader) will certainly find that gentleman or lady,
      on a very short reflection, to be a plausible couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plausible couple are the most ecstatic people living: the most
      sensitive people-to merit-on the face of the earth. Nothing clever or
      virtuous escapes them. They have microscopic eyes for such endowments, and
      can find them anywhere. The plausible couple never fawn-oh no! They don't
      even scruple to tell their friends of their faults. One is too generous,
      another too candid; a third has a tendency to think all people like
      himself, and to regard mankind as a company of angels; a fourth is
      kind-hearted to a fault. 'We never flatter, my dear Mrs. Jackson,' say the
      plausible couple; 'we speak our minds. Neither you nor Mr. Jackson have
      faults enough. It may sound strangely, but it is true. You have not faults
      enough. You know our way,-we must speak out, and always do. Quarrel with
      us for saying so, if you will; but we repeat it,-you have not faults
      enough!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The plausible couple are no less plausible to each other than to third
      parties. They are always loving and harmonious. The plausible gentleman
      calls his wife 'darling,' and the plausible lady addresses him as
      'dearest.' If it be Mr. and Mrs. Bobtail Widger, Mrs. Widger is 'Lavinia,
      darling,' and Mr. Widger is 'Bobtail, dearest.' Speaking of each other,
      they observe the same tender form. Mrs. Widger relates what 'Bobtail'
      said, and Mr. Widger recounts what 'darling' thought and did.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you sit next to the plausible lady at a dinner-table, she takes the
      earliest opportunity of expressing her belief that you are acquainted with
      the Clickits; she is sure she has heard the Clickits speak of you-she must
      not tell you in what terms, or you will take her for a flatterer. You
      admit a knowledge of the Clickits; the plausible lady immediately launches
      out in their praise. She quite loves the Clickits. Were there ever such
      true-hearted, hospitable, excellent people-such a gentle, interesting
      little woman as Mrs. Clickit, or such a frank, unaffected creature as Mr.
      Clickit? were there ever two people, in short, so little spoiled by the
      world as they are? 'As who, darling?' cries Mr. Widger, from the opposite
      side of the table. 'The Clickits, dearest,' replies Mrs. Widger. 'Indeed
      you are right, darling,' Mr. Widger rejoins; 'the Clickits are a very
      high-minded, worthy, estimable couple.' Mrs. Widger remarking that Bobtail
      always grows quite eloquent upon this subject, Mr. Widger admits that he
      feels very strongly whenever such people as the Clickits and some other
      friends of his (here he glances at the host and hostess) are mentioned;
      for they are an honour to human nature, and do one good to think of. 'You
      know the Clickits, Mrs. Jackson?' he says, addressing the lady of the
      house. 'No, indeed; we have not that pleasure,' she replies. 'You astonish
      me!' exclaims Mr. Widger: 'not know the Clickits! why, you are the very
      people of all others who ought to be their bosom friends. You are kindred
      beings; you are one and the same thing:-not know the Clickits! Now will
      you know the Clickits? Will you make a point of knowing them? Will you
      meet them in a friendly way at our house one evening, and be acquainted
      with them?' Mrs. Jackson will be quite delighted; nothing would give her
      more pleasure. 'Then, Lavinia, my darling,' says Mr. Widger, 'mind you
      don't lose sight of that; now, pray take care that Mr. and Mrs. Jackson
      know the Clickits without loss of time. Such people ought not to be
      strangers to each other.' Mrs. Widger books both families as the centre of
      attraction for her next party; and Mr. Widger, going on to expatiate upon
      the virtues of the Clickits, adds to their other moral qualities, that
      they keep one of the neatest phaetons in town, and have two thousand a
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the plausible couple never laud the merits of any absent person,
      without dexterously contriving that their praises shall reflect upon
      somebody who is present, so they never depreciate anything or anybody,
      without turning their depreciation to the same account. Their friend, Mr.
      Slummery, say they, is unquestionably a clever painter, and would no doubt
      be very popular, and sell his pictures at a very high price, if that cruel
      Mr. Fithers had not forestalled him in his department of art, and made it
      thoroughly and completely his own;-Fithers, it is to be observed, being
      present and within hearing, and Slummery elsewhere. Is Mrs. Tabblewick
      really as beautiful as people say? Why, there indeed you ask them a very
      puzzling question, because there is no doubt that she is a very charming
      woman, and they have long known her intimately. She is no doubt beautiful,
      very beautiful; they once thought her the most beautiful woman ever seen;
      still if you press them for an honest answer, they are bound to say that
      this was before they had ever seen our lovely friend on the sofa, (the
      sofa is hard by, and our lovely friend can't help hearing the whispers in
      which this is said;) since that time, perhaps, they have been hardly fair
      judges; Mrs. Tabblewick is no doubt extremely handsome,-very like our
      friend, in fact, in the form of the features,-but in point of expression,
      and soul, and figure, and air altogether-oh dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the plausible couple depreciate, they are still careful to
      preserve their character for amiability and kind feeling; indeed the
      depreciation itself is often made to grow out of their excessive sympathy
      and good will. The plausible lady calls on a lady who dotes upon her
      children, and is sitting with a little girl upon her knee, enraptured by
      her artless replies, and protesting that there is nothing she delights in
      so much as conversing with these fairies; when the other lady inquires if
      she has seen young Mrs. Finching lately, and whether the baby has turned
      out a finer one than it promised to be. 'Oh dear!' cries the plausible
      lady, 'you cannot think how often Bobtail and I have talked about poor
      Mrs. Finching-she is such a dear soul, and was so anxious that the baby
      should be a fine child-and very naturally, because she was very much here
      at one time, and there is, you know, a natural emulation among
      mothers-that it is impossible to tell you how much we have felt for her.'
      'Is it weak or plain, or what?' inquires the other. 'Weak or plain, my
      love,' returns the plausible lady, 'it's a fright-a perfect little fright;
      you never saw such a miserable creature in all your days. Positively you
      must not let her see one of these beautiful dears again, or you'll break
      her heart, you will indeed.-Heaven bless this child, see how she is
      looking in my face! can you conceive anything prettier than that? If poor
      Mrs. Finching could only hope-but that's impossible-and the gifts of
      Providence, you know-What did I do with my pocket-handkerchief!'
    </p>
    <p>
      What prompts the mother, who dotes upon her children, to comment to her
      lord that evening on the plausible lady's engaging qualities and feeling
      heart, and what is it that procures Mr. and Mrs. Bobtail Widger an
      immediate invitation to dinner? THE NICE LITTLE COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      A custom once prevailed in old-fashioned circles, that when a lady or
      gentleman was unable to sing a song, he or she should enliven the company
      with a story. As we find ourself in the predicament of not being able to
      describe (to our own satisfaction) nice little couples in the abstract, we
      purpose telling in this place a little story about a nice little couple of
      our acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Chirrup are the nice little couple in question. Mr. Chirrup
      has the smartness, and something of the brisk, quick manner of a small
      bird. Mrs. Chirrup is the prettiest of all little women, and has the
      prettiest little figure conceivable. She has the neatest little foot, and
      the softest little voice, and the pleasantest little smile, and the
      tidiest little curls, and the brightest little eyes, and the quietest
      little manner, and is, in short, altogether one of the most engaging of
      all little women, dead or alive. She is a condensation of all the domestic
      virtues,-a pocket edition of the young man's best companion,-a little
      woman at a very high pressure, with an amazing quantity of goodness and
      usefulness in an exceedingly small space. Little as she is, Mrs. Chirrup
      might furnish forth matter for the moral equipment of a score of
      housewives, six feet high in their stockings-if, in the presence of
      ladies, we may be allowed the expression-and of corresponding robustness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody knows all this better than Mr. Chirrup, though he rather takes on
      that he don't. Accordingly he is very proud of his better-half, and
      evidently considers himself, as all other people consider him, rather
      fortunate in having her to wife. We say evidently, because Mr. Chirrup is
      a warm-hearted little fellow; and if you catch his eye when he has been
      slyly glancing at Mrs. Chirrup in company, there is a certain complacent
      twinkle in it, accompanied, perhaps, by a half-expressed toss of the head,
      which as clearly indicates what has been passing in his mind as if he had
      put it into words, and shouted it out through a speaking-trumpet.
      Moreover, Mr. Chirrup has a particularly mild and bird-like manner of
      calling Mrs. Chirrup 'my dear;' and-for he is of a jocose turn-of cutting
      little witticisms upon her, and making her the subject of various harmless
      pleasantries, which nobody enjoys more thoroughly than Mrs. Chirrup
      herself. Mr. Chirrup, too, now and then affects to deplore his
      bachelor-days, and to bemoan (with a marvellously contented and smirking
      face) the loss of his freedom, and the sorrow of his heart at having been
      taken captive by Mrs. Chirrup-all of which circumstances combine to show
      the secret triumph and satisfaction of Mr. Chirrup's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already had occasion to observe that Mrs. Chirrup is an
      incomparable housewife. In all the arts of domestic arrangement and
      management, in all the mysteries of confectionery-making, pickling, and
      preserving, never was such a thorough adept as that nice little body. She
      is, besides, a cunning worker in muslin and fine linen, and a special hand
      at marketing to the very best advantage. But if there be one branch of
      housekeeping in which she excels to an utterly unparalleled and
      unprecedented extent, it is in the important one of carving. A roast goose
      is universally allowed to be the great stumbling-block in the way of young
      aspirants to perfection in this department of science; many promising
      carvers, beginning with legs of mutton, and preserving a good reputation
      through fillets of veal, sirloins of beef, quarters of lamb, fowls, and
      even ducks, have sunk before a roast goose, and lost caste and character
      for ever. To Mrs. Chirrup the resolving a goose into its smallest
      component parts is a pleasant pastime-a practical joke-a thing to be done
      in a minute or so, without the smallest interruption to the conversation
      of the time. No handing the dish over to an unfortunate man upon her right
      or left, no wild sharpening of the knife, no hacking and sawing at an
      unruly joint, no noise, no splash, no heat, no leaving off in despair; all
      is confidence and cheerfulness. The dish is set upon the table, the cover
      is removed; for an instant, and only an instant, you observe that Mrs.
      Chirrup's attention is distracted; she smiles, but heareth not. You
      proceed with your story; meanwhile the glittering knife is slowly
      upraised, both Mrs. Chirrup's wrists are slightly but not ungracefully
      agitated, she compresses her lips for an instant, then breaks into a
      smile, and all is over. The legs of the bird slide gently down into a pool
      of gravy, the wings seem to melt from the body, the breast separates into
      a row of juicy slices, the smaller and more complicated parts of his
      anatomy are perfectly developed, a cavern of stuffing is revealed, and the
      goose is gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      To dine with Mr. and Mrs. Chirrup is one of the pleasantest things in the
      world. Mr. Chirrup has a bachelor friend, who lived with him in his own
      days of single blessedness, and to whom he is mightily attached. Contrary
      to the usual custom, this bachelor friend is no less a friend of Mrs.
      Chirrup's, and, consequently, whenever you dine with Mr. and Mrs. Chirrup,
      you meet the bachelor friend. It would put any reasonably-conditioned
      mortal into good-humour to observe the entire unanimity which subsists
      between these three; but there is a quiet welcome dimpling in Mrs.
      Chirrup's face, a bustling hospitality oozing as it were out of the
      waistcoat-pockets of Mr. Chirrup, and a patronising enjoyment of their
      cordiality and satisfaction on the part of the bachelor friend, which is
      quite delightful. On these occasions Mr. Chirrup usually takes an
      opportunity of rallying the friend on being single, and the friend retorts
      on Mr. Chirrup for being married, at which moments some single young
      ladies present are like to die of laughter; and we have more than once
      observed them bestow looks upon the friend, which convinces us that his
      position is by no means a safe one, as, indeed, we hold no bachelor's to
      be who visits married friends and cracks jokes on wedlock, for certain it
      is that such men walk among traps and nets and pitfalls innumerable, and
      often find themselves down upon their knees at the altar rails, taking M.
      or N. for their wedded wives, before they know anything about the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is no business of Mr. Chirrup's, who talks, and laughs, and
      drinks his wine, and laughs again, and talks more, until it is time to
      repair to the drawing-room, where, coffee served and over, Mrs. Chirrup
      prepares for a round game, by sorting the nicest possible little fish into
      the nicest possible little pools, and calling Mr. Chirrup to assist her,
      which Mr. Chirrup does. As they stand side by side, you find that Mr.
      Chirrup is the least possible shadow of a shade taller than Mrs. Chirrup,
      and that they are the neatest and best-matched little couple that can be,
      which the chances are ten to one against your observing with such effect
      at any other time, unless you see them in the street arm-in-arm, or meet
      them some rainy day trotting along under a very small umbrella. The round
      game (at which Mr. Chirrup is the merriest of the party) being done and
      over, in course of time a nice little tray appears, on which is a nice
      little supper; and when that is finished likewise, and you have said 'Good
      night,' you find yourself repeating a dozen times, as you ride home, that
      there never was such a nice little couple as Mr. and Mrs. Chirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it is that pleasant qualities, being packed more closely in small
      bodies than in large, come more readily to hand than when they are
      diffused over a wider space, and have to be gathered together for use, we
      don't know, but as a general rule,-strengthened like all other rules by
      its exceptions,-we hold that little people are sprightly and good-
      natured. The more sprightly and good-natured people we have, the better;
      therefore, let us wish well to all nice little couples, and hope that they
      may increase and multiply. THE EGOTISTICAL COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      Egotism in couples is of two kinds.-It is our purpose to show this by two
      examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The egotistical couple may be young, old, middle-aged, well to do, or ill
      to do; they may have a small family, a large family, or no family at all.
      There is no outward sign by which an egotistical couple may be known and
      avoided. They come upon you unawares; there is no guarding against them.
      No man can of himself be forewarned or forearmed against an egotistical
      couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The egotistical couple have undergone every calamity, and experienced
      every pleasurable and painful sensation of which our nature is
      susceptible. You cannot by possibility tell the egotistical couple
      anything they don't know, or describe to them anything they have not felt.
      They have been everything but dead. Sometimes we are tempted to wish they
      had been even that, but only in our uncharitable moments, which are few
      and far between.
    </p>
    <p>
      We happened the other day, in the course of a morning call, to encounter
      an egotistical couple, nor were we suffered to remain long in ignorance of
      the fact, for our very first inquiry of the lady of the house brought them
      into active and vigorous operation. The inquiry was of course touching the
      lady's health, and the answer happened to be, that she had not been very
      well. 'Oh, my dear!' said the egotistical lady, 'don't talk of not being
      well. We have been in such a state since we saw you last!'-The lady of the
      house happening to remark that her lord had not been well either, the
      egotistical gentleman struck in: 'Never let Briggs complain of not being
      well-never let Briggs complain, my dear Mrs. Briggs, after what I have
      undergone within these six weeks. He doesn't know what it is to be ill, he
      hasn't the least idea of it; not the faintest conception.'-'My dear,'
      interposed his wife smiling, 'you talk as if it were almost a crime in Mr.
      Briggs not to have been as ill as we have been, instead of feeling
      thankful to Providence that both he and our dear Mrs. Briggs are in such
      blissful ignorance of real suffering.'-'My love,' returned the egotistical
      gentleman, in a low and pious voice, 'you mistake me;-I feel grateful-very
      grateful. I trust our friends may never purchase their experience as
      dearly as we have bought ours; I hope they never may!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Having put down Mrs. Briggs upon this theme, and settled the question
      thus, the egotistical gentleman turned to us, and, after a few preliminary
      remarks, all tending towards and leading up to the point he had in his
      mind, inquired if we happened to be acquainted with the Dowager Lady
      Snorflerer. On our replying in the negative, he presumed we had often met
      Lord Slang, or beyond all doubt, that we were on intimate terms with Sir
      Chipkins Glogwog. Finding that we were equally unable to lay claim to
      either of these distinctions, he expressed great astonishment, and turning
      to his wife with a retrospective smile, inquired who it was that had told
      that capital story about the mashed potatoes. 'Who, my dear?' returned the
      egotistical lady, 'why Sir Chipkins, of course; how can you ask! Don't you
      remember his applying it to our cook, and saying that you and I were so
      like the Prince and Princess, that he could almost have sworn we were
      they?' 'To be sure, I remember that,' said the egotistical gentleman, 'but
      are you quite certain that didn't apply to the other anecdote about the
      Emperor of Austria and the pump?' 'Upon my word then, I think it did,'
      replied his wife. 'To be sure it did,' said the egotistical gentleman, 'it
      was Slang's story, I remember now, perfectly.' However, it turned out, a
      few seconds afterwards, that the egotistical gentleman's memory was rather
      treacherous, as he began to have a misgiving that the story had been told
      by the Dowager Lady Snorflerer the very last time they dined there; but
      there appearing, on further consideration, strong circumstantial evidence
      tending to show that this couldn't be, inasmuch as the Dowager Lady
      Snorflerer had been, on the occasion in question, wholly engrossed by the
      egotistical lady, the egotistical gentleman recanted this opinion; and
      after laying the story at the doors of a great many great people, happily
      left it at last with the Duke of Scuttlewig:-observing that it was not
      extraordinary he had forgotten his Grace hitherto, as it often happened
      that the names of those with whom we were upon the most familiar footing
      were the very last to present themselves to our thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It not only appeared that the egotistical couple knew everybody, but that
      scarcely any event of importance or notoriety had occurred for many years
      with which they had not been in some way or other connected. Thus we
      learned that when the well-known attempt upon the life of George the Third
      was made by Hatfield in Drury Lane theatre, the egotistical gentleman's
      grandfather sat upon his right hand and was the first man who collared
      him; and that the egotistical lady's aunt, sitting within a few boxes of
      the royal party, was the only person in the audience who heard his Majesty
      exclaim, 'Charlotte, Charlotte, don't be frightened, don't be frightened;
      they're letting off squibs, they're letting off squibs.' When the fire
      broke out, which ended in the destruction of the two Houses of Parliament,
      the egotistical couple, being at the time at a drawing-room window on
      Blackheath, then and there simultaneously exclaimed, to the astonishment
      of a whole party-'It's the House of Lords!' Nor was this a solitary
      instance of their peculiar discernment, for chancing to be (as by a
      comparison of dates and circumstances they afterwards found) in the same
      omnibus with Mr. Greenacre, when he carried his victim's head about town
      in a blue bag, they both remarked a singular twitching in the muscles of
      his countenance; and walking down Fish Street Hill, a few weeks since, the
      egotistical gentleman said to his lady-slightly casting up his eyes to the
      top of the Monument-'There's a boy up there, my dear, reading a Bible.
      It's very strange. I don't like it.-In five seconds afterwards, Sir,' says
      the egotistical gentleman, bringing his hands together with one violent
      clap-'the lad was over!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diversifying these topics by the introduction of many others of the same
      kind, and entertaining us between whiles with a minute account of what
      weather and diet agreed with them, and what weather and diet disagreed
      with them, and at what time they usually got up, and at what time went to
      bed, with many other particulars of their domestic economy too numerous to
      mention; the egotistical couple at length took their leave, and afforded
      us an opportunity of doing the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Sliverstone are an egotistical couple of another class, for
      all the lady's egotism is about her husband, and all the gentleman's about
      his wife. For example:-Mr. Sliverstone is a clerical gentleman, and
      occasionally writes sermons, as clerical gentlemen do. If you happen to
      obtain admission at the street-door while he is so engaged, Mrs.
      Sliverstone appears on tip-toe, and speaking in a solemn whisper, as if
      there were at least three or four particular friends up-stairs, all upon
      the point of death, implores you to be very silent, for Mr. Sliverstone is
      composing, and she need not say how very important it is that he should
      not be disturbed. Unwilling to interrupt anything so serious, you hasten
      to withdraw, with many apologies; but this Mrs. Sliverstone will by no
      means allow, observing, that she knows you would like to see him, as it is
      very natural you should, and that she is determined to make a trial for
      you, as you are a great favourite. So you are led up-stairs-still on
      tip-toe-to the door of a little back room, in which, as the lady informs
      you in a whisper, Mr. Sliverstone always writes. No answer being returned
      to a couple of soft taps, the lady opens the door, and there, sure enough,
      is Mr. Sliverstone, with dishevelled hair, powdering away with pen, ink,
      and paper, at a rate which, if he has any power of sustaining it, would
      settle the longest sermon in no time. At first he is too much absorbed to
      be roused by this intrusion; but presently looking up, says faintly, 'Ah!'
      and pointing to his desk with a weary and languid smile, extends his hand,
      and hopes you'll forgive him. Then Mrs. Sliverstone sits down beside him,
      and taking his hand in hers, tells you how that Mr. Sliverstone has been
      shut up there ever since nine o'clock in the morning, (it is by this time
      twelve at noon,) and how she knows it cannot be good for his health, and
      is very uneasy about it. Unto this Mr. Sliverstone replies firmly, that
      'It must be done;' which agonizes Mrs. Sliverstone still more, and she
      goes on to tell you that such were Mr. Sliverstone's labours last
      week-what with the buryings, marryings, churchings, christenings, and all
      together,-that when he was going up the pulpit stairs on Sunday evening,
      he was obliged to hold on by the rails, or he would certainly have fallen
      over into his own pew. Mr. Sliverstone, who has been listening and smiling
      meekly, says, 'Not quite so bad as that, not quite so bad!' he admits
      though, on cross-examination, that he was very near falling upon the
      verger who was following him up to bolt the door; but adds, that it was
      his duty as a Christian to fall upon him, if need were, and that he, Mr.
      Sliverstone, and (possibly the verger too) ought to glory in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sentiment communicates new impulse to Mrs. Sliverstone, who launches
      into new praises of Mr. Sliverstone's worth and excellence, to which he
      listens in the same meek silence, save when he puts in a word of
      self-denial relative to some question of fact, as-'Not seventy-two
      christenings that week, my dear. Only seventy-one, only seventy-one.' At
      length his lady has quite concluded, and then he says, Why should he
      repine, why should he give way, why should he suffer his heart to sink
      within him? Is it he alone who toils and suffers? What has she gone
      through, he should like to know? What does she go through every day for
      him and for society?
    </p>
    <p>
      With such an exordium Mr. Sliverstone launches out into glowing praises of
      the conduct of Mrs. Sliverstone in the production of eight young children,
      and the subsequent rearing and fostering of the same; and thus the husband
      magnifies the wife, and the wife the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would be well enough if Mr. and Mrs. Sliverstone kept it to
      themselves, or even to themselves and a friend or two; but they do not.
      The more hearers they have, the more egotistical the couple become, and
      the more anxious they are to make believers in their merits. Perhaps this
      is the worst kind of egotism. It has not even the poor excuse of being
      spontaneous, but is the result of a deliberate system and malice
      aforethought. Mere empty-headed conceit excites our pity, but ostentatious
      hypocrisy awakens our disgust. THE COUPLE WHO CODDLE THEMSELVES
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrywinkle's maiden name was Chopper. She was the only child of Mr.
      and Mrs. Chopper. Her father died when she was, as the play-books express
      it, 'yet an infant;' and so old Mrs. Chopper, when her daughter married,
      made the house of her son-in-law her home from that time henceforth, and
      set up her staff of rest with Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle are a couple who coddle themselves; and the
      venerable Mrs. Chopper is an aider and abettor in the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrywinkle is a rather lean and long-necked gentleman, middle-aged
      and middle-sized, and usually troubled with a cold in the head. Mrs.
      Merrywinkle is a delicate-looking lady, with very light hair, and is
      exceedingly subject to the same unpleasant disorder. The venerable Mrs.
      Chopper-who is strictly entitled to the appellation, her daughter not
      being very young, otherwise than by courtesy, at the time of her marriage,
      which was some years ago-is a mysterious old lady who lurks behind a pair
      of spectacles, and is afflicted with a chronic disease, respecting which
      she has taken a vast deal of medical advice, and referred to a vast number
      of medical books, without meeting any definition of symptoms that at all
      suits her, or enables her to say, 'That's my complaint.' Indeed, the
      absence of authentic information upon the subject of this complaint would
      seem to be Mrs. Chopper's greatest ill, as in all other respects she is an
      uncommonly hale and hearty gentlewoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Mr. and Mrs. Chopper wear an extraordinary quantity of flannel, and
      have a habit of putting their feet in hot water to an unnatural extent.
      They likewise indulge in chamomile tea and such-like compounds, and rub
      themselves on the slightest provocation with camphorated spirits and other
      lotions applicable to mumps, sore-throat, rheumatism, or lumbago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrywinkle's leaving home to go to business on a damp or wet morning
      is a very elaborate affair. He puts on wash-leather socks over his
      stockings, and India-rubber shoes above his boots, and wears under his
      waistcoat a cuirass of hare-skin. Besides these precautions, he winds a
      thick shawl round his throat, and blocks up his mouth with a large silk
      handkerchief. Thus accoutred, and furnished besides with a great-coat and
      umbrella, he braves the dangers of the streets; travelling in severe
      weather at a gentle trot, the better to preserve the circulation, and
      bringing his mouth to the surface to take breath, but very seldom, and
      with the utmost caution. His office-door opened, he shoots past his clerk
      at the same pace, and diving into his own private room, closes the door,
      examines the window-fastenings, and gradually unrobes himself: hanging his
      pocket-handkerchief on the fender to air, and determining to write to the
      newspapers about the fog, which, he says, 'has really got to that pitch
      that it is quite unbearable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In this last opinion Mrs. Merrywinkle and her respected mother fully
      concur; for though not present, their thoughts and tongues are occupied
      with the same subject, which is their constant theme all day. If anybody
      happens to call, Mrs. Merrywinkle opines that they must assuredly be mad,
      and her first salutation is, 'Why, what in the name of goodness can bring
      you out in such weather? You know you must catch your death.' This
      assurance is corroborated by Mrs. Chopper, who adds, in further
      confirmation, a dismal legend concerning an individual of her acquaintance
      who, making a call under precisely parallel circumstances, and being then
      in the best health and spirits, expired in forty-eight hours afterwards,
      of a complication of inflammatory disorders. The visitor, rendered not
      altogether comfortable perhaps by this and other precedents, inquires very
      affectionately after Mr. Merrywinkle, but by so doing brings about no
      change of the subject; for Mr. Merrywinkle's name is inseparably connected
      with his complaints, and his complaints are inseparably connected with
      Mrs. Merrywinkle's; and when these are done with, Mrs. Chopper, who has
      been biding her time, cuts in with the chronic disorder-a subject upon
      which the amiable old lady never leaves off speaking until she is left
      alone, and very often not then.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Merrywinkle comes home to dinner. He is received by Mrs.
      Merrywinkle and Mrs. Chopper, who, on his remarking that he thinks his
      feet are damp, turn pale as ashes and drag him up-stairs, imploring him to
      have them rubbed directly with a dry coarse towel. Rubbed they are, one by
      Mrs. Merrywinkle and one by Mrs. Chopper, until the friction causes Mr.
      Merrywinkle to make horrible faces, and look as if he had been smelling
      very powerful onions; when they desist, and the patient, provided for his
      better security with thick worsted stockings and list slippers, is borne
      down-stairs to dinner. Now, the dinner is always a good one, the appetites
      of the diners being delicate, and requiring a little of what Mrs.
      Merrywinkle calls 'tittivation;' the secret of which is understood to lie
      in good cookery and tasteful spices, and which process is so successfully
      performed in the present instance, that both Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle eat
      a remarkably good dinner, and even the afflicted Mrs. Chopper wields her
      knife and fork with much of the spirit and elasticity of youth. But Mr.
      Merrywinkle, in his desire to gratify his appetite, is not unmindful of
      his health, for he has a bottle of carbonate of soda with which to qualify
      his porter, and a little pair of scales in which to weigh it out. Neither
      in his anxiety to take care of his body is he unmindful of the welfare of
      his immortal part, as he always prays that for what he is going to receive
      he may be made truly thankful; and in order that he may be as thankful as
      possible, eats and drinks to the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either from eating and drinking so much, or from being the victim of this
      constitutional infirmity, among others, Mr. Merrywinkle, after two or
      three glasses of wine, falls fast asleep; and he has scarcely closed his
      eyes, when Mrs. Merrywinkle and Mrs. Chopper fall asleep likewise. It is
      on awakening at tea-time that their most alarming symptoms prevail; for
      then Mr. Merrywinkle feels as if his temples were tightly bound round with
      the chain of the street-door, and Mrs. Merrywinkle as if she had made a
      hearty dinner of half-hundredweights, and Mrs. Chopper as if cold water
      were running down her back, and oyster-knives with sharp points were
      plunging of their own accord into her ribs. Symptoms like these are enough
      to make people peevish, and no wonder that they remain so until
      supper-time, doing little more than doze and complain, unless Mr.
      Merrywinkle calls out very loudly to a servant 'to keep that draught out,'
      or rushes into the passage to flourish his fist in the countenance of the
      twopenny-postman, for daring to give such a knock as he had just performed
      at the door of a private gentleman with nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper, coming after dinner, should consist of some gentle provocative;
      and therefore the tittivating art is again in requisition, and again-done
      honour to by Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle, still comforted and abetted by Mrs.
      Chopper. After supper, it is ten to one but the last- named old lady
      becomes worse, and is led off to bed with the chronic complaint in full
      vigour. Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle, having administered to her a warm
      cordial, which is something of the strongest, then repair to their own
      room, where Mr. Merrywinkle, with his legs and feet in hot water,
      superintends the mulling of some wine which he is to drink at the very
      moment he plunges into bed, while Mrs. Merrywinkle, in garments whose
      nature is unknown to and unimagined by all but married men, takes four
      small pills with a spasmodic look between each, and finally comes to
      something hot and fragrant out of another little saucepan, which serves as
      her composing-draught for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another kind of couple who coddle themselves, and who do so at a
      cheaper rate and on more spare diet, because they are niggardly and
      parsimonious; for which reason they are kind enough to coddle their
      visitors too. It is unnecessary to describe them, for our readers may rest
      assured of the accuracy of these general principles:-that all couples who
      coddle themselves are selfish and slothful,-that they charge upon every
      wind that blows, every rain that falls, and every vapour that hangs in the
      air, the evils which arise from their own imprudence or the gloom which is
      engendered in their own tempers,-and that all men and women, in couples or
      otherwise, who fall into exclusive habits of self- indulgence, and forget
      their natural sympathy and close connexion with everybody and everything
      in the world around them, not only neglect the first duty of life, but, by
      a happy retributive justice, deprive themselves of its truest and best
      enjoyment. THE OLD COUPLE
    </p>
    <p>
      They are grandfather and grandmother to a dozen grown people and have
      great-grandchildren besides; their bodies are bent, their hair is grey,
      their step tottering and infirm. Is this the lightsome pair whose wedding
      was so merry, and have the young couple indeed grown old so soon!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems but yesterday-and yet what a host of cares and griefs are crowded
      into the intervening time which, reckoned by them, lengthens out into a
      century! How many new associations have wreathed themselves about their
      hearts since then! The old time is gone, and a new time has come for
      others-not for them. They are but the rusting link that feebly joins the
      two, and is silently loosening its hold and dropping asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems but yesterday-and yet three of their children have sunk into the
      grave, and the tree that shades it has grown quite old. One was an
      infant-they wept for him; the next a girl, a slight young thing too
      delicate for earth-her loss was hard indeed to bear. The third, a man.
      That was the worst of all, but even that grief is softened now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems but yesterday-and yet how the gay and laughing faces of that
      bright morning have changed and vanished from above ground! Faint
      likenesses of some remain about them yet, but they are very faint and
      scarcely to be traced. The rest are only seen in dreams, and even they are
      unlike what they were, in eyes so old and dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two dresses from the bridal wardrobe are yet preserved. They are of
      a quaint and antique fashion, and seldom seen except in pictures. White
      has turned yellow, and brighter hues have faded. Do you wonder, child? The
      wrinkled face was once as smooth as yours, the eyes as bright, the
      shrivelled skin as fair and delicate. It is the work of hands that have
      been dust these many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where are the fairy lovers of that happy day whose annual return comes
      upon the old man and his wife, like the echo of some village bell which
      has long been silent? Let yonder peevish bachelor, racked by rheumatic
      pains, and quarrelling with the world, let him answer to the question. He
      recollects something of a favourite playmate; her name was Lucy-so they
      tell him. He is not sure whether she was married, or went abroad, or died.
      It is a long while ago, and he don't remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is nothing as it used to be; does no one feel, or think, or act, as in
      days of yore? Yes. There is an aged woman who once lived servant with the
      old lady's father, and is sheltered in an alms-house not far off. She is
      still attached to the family, and loves them all; she nursed the children
      in her lap, and tended in their sickness those who are no more. Her old
      mistress has still something of youth in her eyes; the young ladies are
      like what she was but not quite so handsome, nor are the gentlemen as
      stately as Mr. Harvey used to be. She has seen a great deal of trouble;
      her husband and her son died long ago; but she has got over that, and is
      happy now-quite happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever her attachment to her old protectors were disturbed by fresher
      cares and hopes, it has long since resumed its former current. It has
      filled the void in the poor creature's heart, and replaced the love of
      kindred. Death has not left her alone, and this, with a roof above her
      head, and a warm hearth to sit by, makes her cheerful and contented. Does
      she remember the marriage of great-grandmamma? Ay, that she does, as
      well-as if it was only yesterday. You wouldn't think it to look at her
      now, and perhaps she ought not to say so of herself, but she was as smart
      a young girl then as you'd wish to see. She recollects she took a friend
      of hers up-stairs to see Miss Emma dressed for church; her name was-ah!
      she forgets the name, but she remembers that she was a very pretty girl,
      and that she married not long afterwards, and lived-it has quite passed
      out of her mind where she lived, but she knows she had a bad husband who
      used her ill, and that she died in Lambeth work-house. Dear, dear, in
      Lambeth workhouse!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old couple-have they no comfort or enjoyment of existence? See
      them among their grandchildren and great-grandchildren; how garrulous they
      are, how they compare one with another, and insist on likenesses which no
      one else can see; how gently the old lady lectures the girls on points of
      breeding and decorum, and points the moral by anecdotes of herself in her
      young days-how the old gentleman chuckles over boyish feats and roguish
      tricks, and tells long stories of a 'barring-out' achieved at the school
      he went to: which was very wrong, he tells the boys, and never to be
      imitated of course, but which he cannot help letting them know was very
      pleasant too-especially when he kissed the master's niece. This last,
      however, is a point on which the old lady is very tender, for she
      considers it a shocking and indelicate thing to talk about, and always
      says so whenever it is mentioned, never failing to observe that he ought
      to be very penitent for having been so sinful. So the old gentleman gets
      no further, and what the schoolmaster's niece said afterwards (which he is
      always going to tell) is lost to posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman is eighty years old, to-day-'Eighty years old, Crofts,
      and never had a headache,' he tells the barber who shaves him (the barber
      being a young fellow, and very subject to that complaint). 'That's a great
      age, Crofts,' says the old gentleman. 'I don't think it's sich a wery
      great age, Sir,' replied the barber. 'Crofts,' rejoins the old gentleman,
      'you're talking nonsense to me. Eighty not a great age?' 'It's a wery
      great age, Sir, for a gentleman to be as healthy and active as you are,'
      returns the barber; 'but my grandfather, Sir, he was ninety-four.' 'You
      don't mean that, Crofts?' says the old gentleman. 'I do indeed, Sir,'
      retorts the barber, 'and as wiggerous as Julius Caesar, my grandfather
      was.' The old gentleman muses a little time, and then says, 'What did he
      die of, Crofts?' 'He died accidentally, Sir,' returns the barber; 'he
      didn't mean to do it. He always would go a running about the
      streets-walking never satisfied his spirit-and he run against a post and
      died of a hurt in his chest.' The old gentleman says no more until the
      shaving is concluded, and then he gives Crofts half-a- crown to drink his
      health. He is a little doubtful of the barber's veracity afterwards, and
      telling the anecdote to the old lady, affects to make very light of
      it-though to be sure (he adds) there was old Parr, and in some parts of
      England, ninety-five or so is a common age, quite a common age.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning the old couple are cheerful but serious, recalling old times
      as well as they can remember them, and dwelling upon many passages in
      their past lives which the day brings to mind. The old lady reads aloud,
      in a tremulous voice, out of a great Bible, and the old gentleman with his
      hand to his ear, listens with profound respect. When the book is closed,
      they sit silent for a short space, and afterwards resume their
      conversation, with a reference perhaps to their dead children, as a
      subject not unsuited to that they have just left. By degrees they are led
      to consider which of those who survive are the most like those
      dearly-remembered objects, and so they fall into a less solemn strain, and
      become cheerful again.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many people in all, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and one or two
      intimate friends of the family, dine together to-day at the eldest son's
      to congratulate the old couple, and wish them many happy returns, is a
      calculation beyond our powers; but this we know, that the old couple no
      sooner present themselves, very sprucely and carefully attired, than there
      is a violent shouting and rushing forward of the younger branches with all
      manner of presents, such as pocket-books, pencil-cases, pen-wipers,
      watch-papers, pin-cushions, sleeve-buckles, worked-slippers, watch-guards,
      and even a nutmeg-grater: the latter article being presented by a very
      chubby and very little boy, who exhibits it in great triumph as an
      extraordinary variety. The old couple's emotion at these tokens of
      remembrance occasions quite a pathetic scene, of which the chief
      ingredients are a vast quantity of kissing and hugging, and repeated
      wipings of small eyes and noses with small square pocket-handkerchiefs,
      which don't come at all easily out of small pockets. Even the peevish
      bachelor is moved, and he says, as he presents the old gentleman with a
      queer sort of antique ring from his own finger, that he'll be de'ed if he
      doesn't think he looks younger than he did ten years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the great time is after dinner, when the dessert and wine are on the
      table, which is pushed back to make plenty of room, and they are all
      gathered in a large circle round the fire, for it is then-the glasses
      being filled, and everybody ready to drink the toast-that two great-
      grandchildren rush out at a given signal, and presently return, dragging
      in old Jane Adams leaning upon her crutched stick, and trembling with age
      and pleasure. Who so popular as poor old Jane, nurse and story- teller in
      ordinary to two generations; and who so happy as she, striving to bend her
      stiff limbs into a curtsey, while tears of pleasure steal down her
      withered cheeks!
    </p>
    <p>
      The old couple sit side by side, and the old time seems like yesterday
      indeed. Looking back upon the path they have travelled, its dust and ashes
      disappear; the flowers that withered long ago, show brightly again upon
      its borders, and they grow young once more in the youth of those about
      them. CONCLUSION
    </p>
    <p>
      We have taken for the subjects of the foregoing moral essays, twelve
      samples of married couples, carefully selected from a large stock on hand,
      open to the inspection of all comers. These samples are intended for the
      benefit of the rising generation of both sexes, and, for their more easy
      and pleasant information, have been separately ticketed and labelled in
      the manner they have seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have purposely excluded from consideration the couple in which the lady
      reigns paramount and supreme, holding such cases to be of a very unnatural
      kind, and like hideous births and other monstrous deformities, only to be
      discreetly and sparingly exhibited.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here our self-imposed task would have ended, but that to those young
      ladies and gentlemen who are yet revolving singly round the church,
      awaiting the advent of that time when the mysterious laws of attraction
      shall draw them towards it in couples, we are desirous of addressing a few
      last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before marriage and afterwards, let them learn to centre all their hopes
      of real and lasting happiness in their own fireside; let them cherish the
      faith that in home, and all the English virtues which the love of home
      engenders, lies the only true source of domestic felicity; let them
      believe that round the household gods, contentment and tranquillity
      cluster in their gentlest and most graceful forms; and that many weary
      hunters of happiness through the noisy world, have learnt this truth too
      late, and found a cheerful spirit and a quiet mind only at home at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much may depend on the education of daughters and the conduct of
      mothers; how much of the brightest part of our old national character may
      be perpetuated by their wisdom or frittered away by their folly-how much
      of it may have been lost already, and how much more in danger of vanishing
      every day-are questions too weighty for discussion here, but well
      deserving a little serious consideration from all young couples
      nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that one young couple on whose bright destiny the thoughts of nations
      are fixed, may the youth of England look, and not in vain, for an example.
      From that one young couple, blessed and favoured as they are, may they
      learn that even the glare and glitter of a court, the splendour of a
      palace, and the pomp and glory of a throne, yield in their power of
      conferring happiness, to domestic worth and virtue. From that one young
      couple may they learn that the crown of a great empire, costly and
      jewelled though it be, gives place in the estimation of a Queen to the
      plain gold ring that links her woman's nature to that of tens of thousands
      of her humble subjects, and guards in her woman's heart one secret store
      of tenderness, whose proudest boast shall be that it knows no Royalty save
      Nature's own, and no pride of birth but being the child of heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      So shall the highest young couple in the land for once hear the truth,
      when men throw up their caps, and cry with loving shouts-
    </p>
    <p>
      God bless them.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MUDFOG AND OTHER SKETCHES PUBLIC LIFE OF MR. TULRUMBLE-ONCE MAYOR OF
      MUDFOG
    </p>
    <p>
      Mudfog is a pleasant town-a remarkably pleasant town-situated in a
      charming hollow by the side of a river, from which river, Mudfog derives
      an agreeable scent of pitch, tar, coals, and rope-yarn, a roving
      population in oilskin hats, a pretty steady influx of drunken bargemen,
      and a great many other maritime advantages. There is a good deal of water
      about Mudfog, and yet it is not exactly the sort of town for a
      watering-place, either. Water is a perverse sort of element at the best of
      times, and in Mudfog it is particularly so. In winter, it comes oozing
      down the streets and tumbling over the fields,-nay, rushes into the very
      cellars and kitchens of the houses, with a lavish prodigality that might
      well be dispensed with; but in the hot summer weather it will dry up, and
      turn green: and, although green is a very good colour in its way,
      especially in grass, still it certainly is not becoming to water; and it
      cannot be denied that the beauty of Mudfog is rather impaired, even by
      this trifling circumstance. Mudfog is a healthy place-very healthy;-damp,
      perhaps, but none the worse for that. It's quite a mistake to suppose that
      damp is unwholesome: plants thrive best in damp situations, and why
      shouldn't men? The inhabitants of Mudfog are unanimous in asserting that
      there exists not a finer race of people on the face of the earth; here we
      have an indisputable and veracious contradiction of the vulgar error at
      once. So, admitting Mudfog to be damp, we distinctly state that it is
      salubrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town of Mudfog is extremely picturesque. Limehouse and Ratcliff
      Highway are both something like it, but they give you a very faint idea of
      Mudfog. There are a great many more public-houses in Mudfog-more than in
      Ratcliff Highway and Limehouse put together. The public buildings, too,
      are very imposing. We consider the town-hall one of the finest specimens
      of shed architecture, extant: it is a combination of the pig-sty and
      tea-garden-box orders; and the simplicity of its design is of surpassing
      beauty. The idea of placing a large window on one side of the door, and a
      small one on the other, is particularly happy. There is a fine old Doric
      beauty, too, about the padlock and scraper, which is strictly in keeping
      with the general effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this room do the mayor and corporation of Mudfog assemble together in
      solemn council for the public weal. Seated on the massive wooden benches,
      which, with the table in the centre, form the only furniture of the
      whitewashed apartment, the sage men of Mudfog spend hour after hour in
      grave deliberation. Here they settle at what hour of the night the
      public-houses shall be closed, at what hour of the morning they shall be
      permitted to open, how soon it shall be lawful for people to eat their
      dinner on church-days, and other great political questions; and sometimes,
      long after silence has fallen on the town, and the distant lights from the
      shops and houses have ceased to twinkle, like far-off stars, to the sight
      of the boatmen on the river, the illumination in the two unequal-sized
      windows of the town-hall, warns the inhabitants of Mudfog that its little
      body of legislators, like a larger and better- known body of the same
      genus, a great deal more noisy, and not a whit more profound, are
      patriotically dozing away in company, far into the night, for their
      country's good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among this knot of sage and learned men, no one was so eminently
      distinguished, during many years, for the quiet modesty of his appearance
      and demeanour, as Nicholas Tulrumble, the well-known coal- dealer. However
      exciting the subject of discussion, however animated the tone of the
      debate, or however warm the personalities exchanged, (and even in Mudfog
      we get personal sometimes,) Nicholas Tulrumble was always the same. To say
      truth, Nicholas, being an industrious man, and always up betimes, was apt
      to fall asleep when a debate began, and to remain asleep till it was over,
      when he would wake up very much refreshed, and give his vote with the
      greatest complacency. The fact was, that Nicholas Tulrumble, knowing that
      everybody there had made up his mind beforehand, considered the talking as
      just a long botheration about nothing at all; and to the present hour it
      remains a question, whether, on this point at all events, Nicholas
      Tulrumble was not pretty near right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, which strews a man's head with silver, sometimes fills his pockets
      with gold. As he gradually performed one good office for Nicholas
      Tulrumble, he was obliging enough, not to omit the other. Nicholas began
      life in a wooden tenement of four feet square, with a capital of two and
      ninepence, and a stock in trade of three bushels and a-half of coals,
      exclusive of the large lump which hung, by way of sign-board, outside.
      Then he enlarged the shed, and kept a truck; then he left the shed, and
      the truck too, and started a donkey and a Mrs. Tulrumble; then he moved
      again and set up a cart; the cart was soon afterwards exchanged for a
      waggon; and so he went on like his great predecessor Whittington-only
      without a cat for a partner-increasing in wealth and fame, until at last
      he gave up business altogether, and retired with Mrs. Tulrumble and family
      to Mudfog Hall, which he had himself erected, on something which he
      attempted to delude himself into the belief was a hill, about a quarter of
      a mile distant from the town of Mudfog.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, it began to be murmured in Mudfog that Nicholas Tulrumble
      was growing vain and haughty; that prosperity and success had corrupted
      the simplicity of his manners, and tainted the natural goodness of his
      heart; in short, that he was setting up for a public character, and a
      great gentleman, and affected to look down upon his old companions with
      compassion and contempt. Whether these reports were at the time
      well-founded, or not, certain it is that Mrs. Tulrumble very shortly
      afterwards started a four-wheel chaise, driven by a tall postilion in a
      yellow cap,-that Mr. Tulrumble junior took to smoking cigars, and calling
      the footman a 'feller,'-and that Mr. Tulrumble from that time forth, was
      no more seen in his old seat in the chimney-corner of the Lighterman's
      Arms at night. This looked bad; but, more than this, it began to be
      observed that Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble attended the corporation meetings
      more frequently than heretofore; and he no longer went to sleep as he had
      done for so many years, but propped his eyelids open with his two
      forefingers; that he read the newspapers by himself at home; and that he
      was in the habit of indulging abroad in distant and mysterious allusions
      to 'masses of people,' and 'the property of the country,' and 'productive
      power,' and 'the monied interest:' all of which denoted and proved that
      Nicholas Tulrumble was either mad, or worse; and it puzzled the good
      people of Mudfog amazingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, about the middle of the month of October, Mr. Tulrumble and
      family went up to London; the middle of October being, as Mrs. Tulrumble
      informed her acquaintance in Mudfog, the very height of the fashionable
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other, just about this time, despite the health-preserving air
      of Mudfog, the Mayor died. It was a most extraordinary circumstance; he
      had lived in Mudfog for eighty-five years. The corporation didn't
      understand it at all; indeed it was with great difficulty that one old
      gentleman, who was a great stickler for forms, was dissuaded from
      proposing a vote of censure on such unaccountable conduct. Strange as it
      was, however, die he did, without taking the slightest notice of the
      corporation; and the corporation were imperatively called upon to elect
      his successor. So, they met for the purpose; and being very full of
      Nicholas Tulrumble just then, and Nicholas Tulrumble being a very
      important man, they elected him, and wrote off to London by the very next
      post to acquaint Nicholas Tulrumble with his new elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it being November time, and Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble being in the
      capital, it fell out that he was present at the Lord Mayor's show and
      dinner, at sight of the glory and splendour whereof, he, Mr. Tulrumble,
      was greatly mortified, inasmuch as the reflection would force itself on
      his mind, that, had he been born in London instead of in Mudfog, he might
      have been a Lord Mayor too, and have patronized the judges, and been
      affable to the Lord Chancellor, and friendly with the Premier, and coldly
      condescending to the Secretary to the Treasury, and have dined with a flag
      behind his back, and done a great many other acts and deeds which unto
      Lord Mayors of London peculiarly appertain. The more he thought of the
      Lord Mayor, the more enviable a personage he seemed. To be a King was all
      very well; but what was the King to the Lord Mayor! When the King made a
      speech, everybody knew it was somebody else's writing; whereas here was
      the Lord Mayor, talking away for half an hour- all out of his own
      head-amidst the enthusiastic applause of the whole company, while it was
      notorious that the King might talk to his parliament till he was black in
      the face without getting so much as a single cheer. As all these
      reflections passed through the mind of Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble, the Lord
      Mayor of London appeared to him the greatest sovereign on the face of the
      earth, beating the Emperor of Russia all to nothing, and leaving the Great
      Mogul immeasurably behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble was pondering over these things, and inwardly
      cursing the fate which had pitched his coal-shed in Mudfog, when the
      letter of the corporation was put into his hand. A crimson flush mantled
      over his face as he read it, for visions of brightness were already
      dancing before his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear,' said Mr. Tulrumble to his wife, 'they have elected me, Mayor of
      Mudfog.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lor-a-mussy!' said Mrs. Tulrumble: 'why what's become of old Sniggs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The late Mr. Sniggs, Mrs. Tulrumble,' said Mr. Tulrumble sharply, for he
      by no means approved of the notion of unceremoniously designating a
      gentleman who filled the high office of Mayor, as 'Old Sniggs,'-'The late
      Mr. Sniggs, Mrs. Tulrumble, is dead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The communication was very unexpected; but Mrs. Tulrumble only ejaculated
      'Lor-a-mussy!' once again, as if a Mayor were a mere ordinary Christian,
      at which Mr. Tulrumble frowned gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a pity 'tan't in London, ain't it?' said Mrs. Tulrumble, after a
      short pause; 'what a pity 'tan't in London, where you might have had a
      show.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I might have a show in Mudfog, if I thought proper, I apprehend,' said
      Mr. Tulrumble mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lor! so you might, I declare,' replied Mrs. Tulrumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And a good one too,' said Mr. Tulrumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Delightful!' exclaimed Mrs. Tulrumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One which would rather astonish the ignorant people down there,' said Mr.
      Tulrumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would kill them with envy,' said Mrs. Tulrumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was agreed that his Majesty's lieges in Mudfog should be astonished
      with splendour, and slaughtered with envy, and that such a show should
      take place as had never been seen in that town, or in any other town
      before,-no, not even in London itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very next day after the receipt of the letter, down came the tall
      postilion in a post-chaise,-not upon one of the horses, but
      inside-actually inside the chaise,-and, driving up to the very door of the
      town-hall, where the corporation were assembled, delivered a letter,
      written by the Lord knows who, and signed by Nicholas Tulrumble, in which
      Nicholas said, all through four sides of closely-written, gilt- edged,
      hot-pressed, Bath post letter paper, that he responded to the call of his
      fellow-townsmen with feelings of heartfelt delight; that he accepted the
      arduous office which their confidence had imposed upon him; that they
      would never find him shrinking from the discharge of his duty; that he
      would endeavour to execute his functions with all that dignity which their
      magnitude and importance demanded; and a great deal more to the same
      effect. But even this was not all. The tall postilion produced from his
      right-hand top-boot, a damp copy of that afternoon's number of the county
      paper; and there, in large type, running the whole length of the very
      first column, was a long address from Nicholas Tulrumble to the
      inhabitants of Mudfog, in which he said that he cheerfully complied with
      their requisition, and, in short, as if to prevent any mistake about the
      matter, told them over again what a grand fellow he meant to be, in very
      much the same terms as those in which he had already told them all about
      the matter in his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corporation stared at one another very hard at all this, and then
      looked as if for explanation to the tall postilion, but as the tall
      postilion was intently contemplating the gold tassel on the top of his
      yellow cap, and could have afforded no explanation whatever, even if his
      thoughts had been entirely disengaged, they contented themselves with
      coughing very dubiously, and looking very grave. The tall postilion then
      delivered another letter, in which Nicholas Tulrumble informed the
      corporation, that he intended repairing to the town-hall, in grand state
      and gorgeous procession, on the Monday afternoon next ensuing. At this the
      corporation looked still more solemn; but, as the epistle wound up with a
      formal invitation to the whole body to dine with the Mayor on that day, at
      Mudfog Hall, Mudfog Hill, Mudfog, they began to see the fun of the thing
      directly, and sent back their compliments, and they'd be sure to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there happened to be in Mudfog, as somehow or other there does happen
      to be, in almost every town in the British dominions, and perhaps in
      foreign dominions too-we think it very likely, but, being no great
      traveller, cannot distinctly say-there happened to be, in Mudfog, a
      merry-tempered, pleasant-faced, good-for-nothing sort of vagabond, with an
      invincible dislike to manual labour, and an unconquerable attachment to
      strong beer and spirits, whom everybody knew, and nobody, except his wife,
      took the trouble to quarrel with, who inherited from his ancestors the
      appellation of Edward Twigger, and rejoiced in the sobriquet of
      Bottle-nosed Ned. He was drunk upon the average once a day, and penitent
      upon an equally fair calculation once a month; and when he was penitent,
      he was invariably in the very last stage of maudlin intoxication. He was a
      ragged, roving, roaring kind of fellow, with a burly form, a sharp wit,
      and a ready head, and could turn his hand to anything when he chose to do
      it. He was by no means opposed to hard labour on principle, for he would
      work away at a cricket-match by the day together,-running, and catching,
      and batting, and bowling, and revelling in toil which would exhaust a
      galley-slave. He would have been invaluable to a fire-office; never was a
      man with such a natural taste for pumping engines, running up ladders, and
      throwing furniture out of two-pair-of-stairs' windows: nor was this the
      only element in which he was at home; he was a humane society in himself,
      a portable drag, an animated life-preserver, and had saved more people, in
      his time, from drowning, than the Plymouth life-boat, or Captain Manby's
      apparatus. With all these qualifications, notwithstanding his dissipation,
      Bottle-nosed Ned was a general favourite; and the authorities of Mudfog,
      remembering his numerous services to the population, allowed him in return
      to get drunk in his own way, without the fear of stocks, fine, or
      imprisonment. He had a general licence, and he showed his sense of the
      compliment by making the most of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been thus particular in describing the character and avocations of
      Bottle-nosed Ned, because it enables us to introduce a fact politely,
      without hauling it into the reader's presence with indecent haste by the
      head and shoulders, and brings us very naturally to relate, that on the
      very same evening on which Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble and family returned to
      Mudfog, Mr. Tulrumble's new secretary, just imported from London, with a
      pale face and light whiskers, thrust his head down to the very bottom of
      his neckcloth-tie, in at the tap-room door of the Lighterman's Arms, and
      inquiring whether one Ned Twigger was luxuriating within, announced
      himself as the bearer of a message from Nicholas Tulrumble, Esquire,
      requiring Mr. Twigger's immediate attendance at the hall, on private and
      particular business. It being by no means Mr. Twigger's interest to
      affront the Mayor, he rose from the fireplace with a slight sigh, and
      followed the light-whiskered secretary through the dirt and wet of Mudfog
      streets, up to Mudfog Hall, without further ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble was seated in a small cavern with a skylight, which
      he called his library, sketching out a plan of the procession on a large
      sheet of paper; and into the cavern the secretary ushered Ned Twigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Twigger!' said Nicholas Tulrumble, condescendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a time when Twigger would have replied, 'Well, Nick!' but that
      was in the days of the truck, and a couple of years before the donkey; so,
      he only bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want you to go into training, Twigger,' said Mr. Tulrumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What for, sir?' inquired Ned, with a stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hush, hush, Twigger!' said the Mayor. 'Shut the door, Mr. Jennings. Look
      here, Twigger.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Mayor said this, he unlocked a high closet, and disclosed a
      complete suit of brass armour, of gigantic dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want you to wear this next Monday, Twigger,' said the Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless your heart and soul, sir!' replied Ned, 'you might as well ask me
      to wear a seventy-four pounder, or a cast-iron boiler.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, Twigger, nonsense!' said the Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I couldn't stand under it, sir,' said Twigger; 'it would make mashed
      potatoes of me, if I attempted it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pooh, pooh, Twigger!' returned the Mayor. 'I tell you I have seen it done
      with my own eyes, in London, and the man wasn't half such a man as you
      are, either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should as soon have thought of a man's wearing the case of an eight-
      day clock to save his linen,' said Twigger, casting a look of apprehension
      at the brass suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the easiest thing in the world,' rejoined the Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's nothing,' said Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When you're used to it,' added Ned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You do it by degrees,' said the Mayor. 'You would begin with one piece
      to-morrow, and two the next day, and so on, till you had got it all on.
      Mr. Jennings, give Twigger a glass of rum. Just try the breast-plate,
      Twigger. Stay; take another glass of rum first. Help me to lift it, Mr.
      Jennings. Stand firm, Twigger! There!-it isn't half as heavy as it looks,
      is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Twigger was a good strong, stout fellow; so, after a great deal of
      staggering, he managed to keep himself up, under the breastplate, and even
      contrived, with the aid of another glass of rum, to walk about in it, and
      the gauntlets into the bargain. He made a trial of the helmet, but was not
      equally successful, inasmuch as he tipped over instantly,-an accident
      which Mr. Tulrumble clearly demonstrated to be occasioned by his not
      having a counteracting weight of brass on his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, wear that with grace and propriety on Monday next,' said Tulrumble,
      'and I'll make your fortune.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll try what I can do, sir,' said Twigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It must be kept a profound secret,' said Tulrumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, sir,' replied Twigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you must be sober,' said Tulrumble; 'perfectly sober.' Mr. Twigger at
      once solemnly pledged himself to be as sober as a judge, and Nicholas
      Tulrumble was satisfied, although, had we been Nicholas, we should
      certainly have exacted some promise of a more specific nature; inasmuch
      as, having attended the Mudfog assizes in the evening more than once, we
      can solemnly testify to having seen judges with very strong symptoms of
      dinner under their wigs. However, that's neither here nor there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, and the day following, and the day after that, Ned Twigger
      was securely locked up in the small cavern with the sky-light, hard at
      work at the armour. With every additional piece he could manage to stand
      upright in, he had an additional glass of rum; and at last, after many
      partial suffocations, he contrived to get on the whole suit, and to
      stagger up and down the room in it, like an intoxicated effigy from
      Westminster Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was man so delighted as Nicholas Tulrumble; never was woman so
      charmed as Nicholas Tulrumble's wife. Here was a sight for the common
      people of Mudfog! A live man in brass armour! Why, they would go wild with
      wonder!
    </p>
    <p>
      The day-the Monday-arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the morning had been made to order, it couldn't have been better
      adapted to the purpose. They never showed a better fog in London on Lord
      Mayor's day, than enwrapped the town of Mudfog on that eventful occasion.
      It had risen slowly and surely from the green and stagnant water with the
      first light of morning, until it reached a little above the lamp-post
      tops; and there it had stopped, with a sleepy, sluggish obstinacy, which
      bade defiance to the sun, who had got up very blood- shot about the eyes,
      as if he had been at a drinking-party over-night, and was doing his day's
      work with the worst possible grace. The thick damp mist hung over the town
      like a huge gauze curtain. All was dim and dismal. The church steeples had
      bidden a temporary adieu to the world below; and every object of lesser
      importance-houses, barns, hedges, trees, and barges-had all taken the
      veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church-clock struck one. A cracked trumpet from the front garden of
      Mudfog Hall produced a feeble flourish, as if some asthmatic person had
      coughed into it accidentally; the gate flew open, and out came a
      gentleman, on a moist-sugar coloured charger, intended to represent a
      herald, but bearing a much stronger resemblance to a court-card on
      horseback. This was one of the Circus people, who always came down to
      Mudfog at that time of the year, and who had been engaged by Nicholas
      Tulrumble expressly for the occasion. There was the horse, whisking his
      tail about, balancing himself on his hind-legs, and flourishing away with
      his fore-feet, in a manner which would have gone to the hearts and souls
      of any reasonable crowd. But a Mudfog crowd never was a reasonable one,
      and in all probability never will be. Instead of scattering the very fog
      with their shouts, as they ought most indubitably to have done, and were
      fully intended to do, by Nicholas Tulrumble, they no sooner recognized the
      herald, than they began to growl forth the most unqualified disapprobation
      at the bare notion of his riding like any other man. If he had come out on
      his head indeed, or jumping through a hoop, or flying through a red-hot
      drum, or even standing on one leg with his other foot in his mouth, they
      might have had something to say to him; but for a professional gentleman
      to sit astride in the saddle, with his feet in the stirrups, was rather
      too good a joke. So, the herald was a decided failure, and the crowd
      hooted with great energy, as he pranced ingloriously away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the procession came. We are afraid to say how many supernumeraries
      there were, in striped shirts and black velvet caps, to imitate the London
      watermen, or how many base imitations of running-footmen, or how many
      banners, which, owing to the heaviness of the atmosphere, could by no
      means be prevailed on to display their inscriptions: still less do we feel
      disposed to relate how the men who played the wind instruments, looking up
      into the sky (we mean the fog) with musical fervour, walked through pools
      of water and hillocks of mud, till they covered the powdered heads of the
      running-footmen aforesaid with splashes, that looked curious, but not
      ornamental; or how the barrel-organ performer put on the wrong stop, and
      played one tune while the band played another; or how the horses, being
      used to the arena, and not to the streets, would stand still and dance,
      instead of going on and prancing;-all of which are matters which might be
      dilated upon to great advantage, but which we have not the least intention
      of dilating upon, notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! it was a grand and beautiful sight to behold a corporation in glass
      coaches, provided at the sole cost and charge of Nicholas Tulrumble,
      coming rolling along, like a funeral out of mourning, and to watch the
      attempts the corporation made to look great and solemn, when Nicholas
      Tulrumble himself, in the four-wheel chaise, with the tall postilion,
      rolled out after them, with Mr. Jennings on one side to look like a
      chaplain, and a supernumerary on the other, with an old life-guardsman's
      sabre, to imitate the sword-bearer; and to see the tears rolling down the
      faces of the mob as they screamed with merriment. This was beautiful! and
      so was the appearance of Mrs. Tulrumble and son, as they bowed with grave
      dignity out of their coach-window to all the dirty faces that were
      laughing around them: but it is not even with this that we have to do, but
      with the sudden stopping of the procession at another blast of the
      trumpet, whereat, and whereupon, a profound silence ensued, and all eyes
      were turned towards Mudfog Hall, in the confident anticipation of some new
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They won't laugh now, Mr. Jennings,' said Nicholas Tulrumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think not, sir,' said Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'See how eager they look,' said Nicholas Tulrumble. 'Aha! the laugh will
      be on our side now; eh, Mr. Jennings?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt of that, sir,' replied Mr. Jennings; and Nicholas Tulrumble, in
      a state of pleasurable excitement, stood up in the four-wheel chaise, and
      telegraphed gratification to the Mayoress behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all this was going forward, Ned Twigger had descended into the
      kitchen of Mudfog Hall for the purpose of indulging the servants with a
      private view of the curiosity that was to burst upon the town; and,
      somehow or other, the footman was so companionable, and the housemaid so
      kind, and the cook so friendly, that he could not resist the offer of the
      first-mentioned to sit down and take something-just to drink success to
      master in.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, down Ned Twigger sat himself in his brass livery on the top of the
      kitchen-table; and in a mug of something strong, paid for by the
      unconscious Nicholas Tulrumble, and provided by the companionable footman,
      drank success to the Mayor and his procession; and, as Ned laid by his
      helmet to imbibe the something strong, the companionable footman put it on
      his own head, to the immeasurable and unrecordable delight of the cook and
      housemaid. The companionable footman was very facetious to Ned, and Ned
      was very gallant to the cook and housemaid by turns. They were all very
      cosy and comfortable; and the something strong went briskly round.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Ned Twigger was loudly called for, by the procession people: and,
      having had his helmet fixed on, in a very complicated manner, by the
      companionable footman, and the kind housemaid, and the friendly cook, he
      walked gravely forth, and appeared before the multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd roared-it was not with wonder, it was not with surprise; it was
      most decidedly and unquestionably with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What!' said Mr. Tulrumble, starting up in the four-wheel chaise.
      'Laughing? If they laugh at a man in real brass armour, they'd laugh when
      their own fathers were dying. Why doesn't he go into his place, Mr.
      Jennings? What's he rolling down towards us for? he has no business here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid, sir-' faltered Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Afraid of what, sir?' said Nicholas Tulrumble, looking up into the
      secretary's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid he's drunk, sir,' replied Mr. Jennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Tulrumble took one look at the extraordinary figure that was
      bearing down upon them; and then, clasping his secretary by the arm,
      uttered an audible groan in anguish of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a melancholy fact that Mr. Twigger having full licence to demand a
      single glass of rum on the putting on of every piece of the armour, got,
      by some means or other, rather out of his calculation in the hurry and
      confusion of preparation, and drank about four glasses to a piece instead
      of one, not to mention the something strong which went on the top of it.
      Whether the brass armour checked the natural flow of perspiration, and
      thus prevented the spirit from evaporating, we are not scientific enough
      to know; but, whatever the cause was, Mr. Twigger no sooner found himself
      outside the gate of Mudfog Hall, than he also found himself in a very
      considerable state of intoxication; and hence his extraordinary style of
      progressing. This was bad enough, but, as if fate and fortune had
      conspired against Nicholas Tulrumble, Mr. Twigger, not having been
      penitent for a good calendar month, took it into his head to be most
      especially and particularly sentimental, just when his repentance could
      have been most conveniently dispensed with. Immense tears were rolling
      down his cheeks, and he was vainly endeavouring to conceal his grief by
      applying to his eyes a blue cotton pocket- handkerchief with white
      spots,-an article not strictly in keeping with a suit of armour some three
      hundred years old, or thereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twigger, you villain!' said Nicholas Tulrumble, quite forgetting his
      dignity, 'go back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never,' said Ned. 'I'm a miserable wretch. I'll never leave you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The by-standers of course received this declaration with acclamations of
      'That's right, Ned; don't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't intend it,' said Ned, with all the obstinacy of a very tipsy man.
      'I'm very unhappy. I'm the wretched father of an unfortunate family; but I
      am very faithful, sir. I'll never leave you.' Having reiterated this
      obliging promise, Ned proceeded in broken words to harangue the crowd upon
      the number of years he had lived in Mudfog, the excessive respectability
      of his character, and other topics of the like nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here! will anybody lead him away?' said Nicholas: 'if they'll call on me
      afterwards, I'll reward them well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three men stepped forward, with the view of bearing Ned off, when
      the secretary interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take care! take care!' said Mr. Jennings. 'I beg your pardon, sir; but
      they'd better not go too near him, because, if he falls over, he'll
      certainly crush somebody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At this hint the crowd retired on all sides to a very respectful distance,
      and left Ned, like the Duke of Devonshire, in a little circle of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Mr. Jennings,' said Nicholas Tulrumble, 'he'll be suffocated.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm very sorry for it, sir,' replied Mr. Jennings; 'but nobody can get
      that armour off, without his own assistance. I'm quite certain of it from
      the way he put it on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Ned wept dolefully, and shook his helmeted head, in a manner that
      might have touched a heart of stone; but the crowd had not hearts of
      stone, and they laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me, Mr. Jennings,' said Nicholas, turning pale at the possibility of
      Ned's being smothered in his antique costume-'Dear me, Mr. Jennings, can
      nothing be done with him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing at all,' replied Ned, 'nothing at all. Gentlemen, I'm an unhappy
      wretch. I'm a body, gentlemen, in a brass coffin.' At this poetical idea
      of his own conjuring up, Ned cried so much that the people began to get
      sympathetic, and to ask what Nicholas Tulrumble meant by putting a man
      into such a machine as that; and one individual in a hairy waistcoat like
      the top of a trunk, who had previously expressed his opinion that if Ned
      hadn't been a poor man, Nicholas wouldn't have dared do it, hinted at the
      propriety of breaking the four-wheel chaise, or Nicholas's head, or both,
      which last compound proposition the crowd seemed to consider a very good
      notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not acted upon, however, for it had hardly been broached, when Ned
      Twigger's wife made her appearance abruptly in the little circle before
      noticed, and Ned no sooner caught a glimpse of her face and form, than
      from the mere force of habit he set off towards his home just as fast as
      his legs could carry him; and that was not very quick in the present
      instance either, for, however ready they might have been to carry him,
      they couldn't get on very well under the brass armour. So, Mrs. Twigger
      had plenty of time to denounce Nicholas Tulrumble to his face: to express
      her opinion that he was a decided monster; and to intimate that, if her
      ill-used husband sustained any personal damage from the brass armour, she
      would have the law of Nicholas Tulrumble for manslaughter. When she had
      said all this with due vehemence, she posted after Ned, who was dragging
      himself along as best he could, and deploring his unhappiness in most
      dismal tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a wailing and screaming Ned's children raised when he got home at
      last! Mrs. Twigger tried to undo the armour, first in one place, and then
      in another, but she couldn't manage it; so she tumbled Ned into bed,
      helmet, armour, gauntlets, and all. Such a creaking as the bedstead made,
      under Ned's weight in his new suit! It didn't break down though; and there
      Ned lay, like the anonymous vessel in the Bay of Biscay, till next day,
      drinking barley-water, and looking miserable: and every time he groaned,
      his good lady said it served him right, which was all the consolation Ned
      Twigger got.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Tulrumble and the gorgeous procession went on together to the
      town-hall, amid the hisses and groans of all the spectators, who had
      suddenly taken it into their heads to consider poor Ned a martyr. Nicholas
      was formally installed in his new office, in acknowledgment of which
      ceremony he delivered himself of a speech, composed by the secretary,
      which was very long, and no doubt very good, only the noise of the people
      outside prevented anybody from hearing it, but Nicholas Tulrumble himself.
      After which, the procession got back to Mudfog Hall any how it could; and
      Nicholas and the corporation sat down to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dinner was flat, and Nicholas was disappointed. They were such
      dull sleepy old fellows, that corporation. Nicholas made quite as long
      speeches as the Lord Mayor of London had done, nay, he said the very same
      things that the Lord Mayor of London had said, and the deuce a cheer the
      corporation gave him. There was only one man in the party who was
      thoroughly awake; and he was insolent, and called him Nick. Nick! What
      would be the consequence, thought Nicholas, of anybody presuming to call
      the Lord Mayor of London 'Nick!' He should like to know what the
      sword-bearer would say to that; or the recorder, or the toast-master, or
      any other of the great officers of the city. They'd nick him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these were not the worst of Nicholas Tulrumble's doings. If they had
      been, he might have remained a Mayor to this day, and have talked till he
      lost his voice. He contracted a relish for statistics, and got
      philosophical; and the statistics and the philosophy together, led him
      into an act which increased his unpopularity and hastened his downfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very end of the Mudfog High-street, and abutting on the river-
      side, stands the Jolly Boatmen, an old-fashioned low-roofed, bay- windowed
      house, with a bar, kitchen, and tap-room all in one, and a large fireplace
      with a kettle to correspond, round which the working men have congregated
      time out of mind on a winter's night, refreshed by draughts of good strong
      beer, and cheered by the sounds of a fiddle and tambourine: the Jolly
      Boatmen having been duly licensed by the Mayor and corporation, to scrape
      the fiddle and thumb the tambourine from time, whereof the memory of the
      oldest inhabitants goeth not to the contrary. Now Nicholas Tulrumble had
      been reading pamphlets on crime, and parliamentary reports,-or had made
      the secretary read them to him, which is the same thing in effect,-and he
      at once perceived that this fiddle and tambourine must have done more to
      demoralize Mudfog, than any other operating causes that ingenuity could
      imagine. So he read up for the subject, and determined to come out on the
      corporation with a burst, the very next time the licence was applied for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The licensing day came, and the red-faced landlord of the Jolly Boatmen
      walked into the town-hall, looking as jolly as need be, having actually
      put on an extra fiddle for that night, to commemorate the anniversary of
      the Jolly Boatmen's music licence. It was applied for in due form, and was
      just about to be granted as a matter of course, when up rose Nicholas
      Tulrumble, and drowned the astonished corporation in a torrent of
      eloquence. He descanted in glowing terms upon the increasing depravity of
      his native town of Mudfog, and the excesses committed by its population.
      Then, he related how shocked he had been, to see barrels of beer sliding
      down into the cellar of the Jolly Boatmen week after week; and how he had
      sat at a window opposite the Jolly Boatmen for two days together, to count
      the people who went in for beer between the hours of twelve and one
      o'clock alone-which, by-the-bye, was the time at which the great majority
      of the Mudfog people dined. Then, he went on to state, how the number of
      people who came out with beer-jugs, averaged twenty-one in five minutes,
      which, being multiplied by twelve, gave two hundred and fifty-two people
      with beer-jugs in an hour, and multiplied again by fifteen (the number of
      hours during which the house was open daily) yielded three thousand seven
      hundred and eighty people with beer-jugs per day, or twenty-six thousand
      four hundred and sixty people with beer-jugs, per week. Then he proceeded
      to show that a tambourine and moral degradation were synonymous terms, and
      a fiddle and vicious propensities wholly inseparable. All these arguments
      he strengthened and demonstrated by frequent references to a large book
      with a blue cover, and sundry quotations from the Middlesex magistrates;
      and in the end, the corporation, who were posed with the figures, and
      sleepy with the speech, and sadly in want of dinner into the bargain,
      yielded the palm to Nicholas Tulrumble, and refused the music licence to
      the Jolly Boatmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although Nicholas triumphed, his triumph was short. He carried on the
      war against beer-jugs and fiddles, forgetting the time when he was glad to
      drink out of the one, and to dance to the other, till the people hated,
      and his old friends shunned him. He grew tired of the lonely magnificence
      of Mudfog Hall, and his heart yearned towards the Lighterman's Arms. He
      wished he had never set up as a public man, and sighed for the good old
      times of the coal-shop, and the chimney corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length old Nicholas, being thoroughly miserable, took heart of grace,
      paid the secretary a quarter's wages in advance, and packed him off to
      London by the next coach. Having taken this step, he put his hat on his
      head, and his pride in his pocket, and walked down to the old room at the
      Lighterman's Arms. There were only two of the old fellows there, and they
      looked coldly on Nicholas as he proffered his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you going to put down pipes, Mr. Tulrumble?' said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or trace the progress of crime to 'bacca?' growled another.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neither,' replied Nicholas Tulrumble, shaking hands with them both,
      whether they would or not. 'I've come down to say that I'm very sorry for
      having made a fool of myself, and that I hope you'll give me up the old
      chair, again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fellows opened their eyes, and three or four more old fellows
      opened the door, to whom Nicholas, with tears in his eyes, thrust out his
      hand too, and told the same story. They raised a shout of joy, that made
      the bells in the ancient church-tower vibrate again, and wheeling the old
      chair into the warm corner, thrust old Nicholas down into it, and ordered
      in the very largest-sized bowl of hot punch, with an unlimited number of
      pipes, directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the Jolly Boatmen got the licence, and the next night, old
      Nicholas and Ned Twigger's wife led off a dance to the music of the fiddle
      and tambourine, the tone of which seemed mightily improved by a little
      rest, for they never had played so merrily before. Ned Twigger was in the
      very height of his glory, and he danced hornpipes, and balanced chairs on
      his chin, and straws on his nose, till the whole company, including the
      corporation, were in raptures of admiration at the brilliancy of his
      acquirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tulrumble, junior, couldn't make up his mind to be anything but
      magnificent, so he went up to London and drew bills on his father; and
      when he had overdrawn, and got into debt, he grew penitent, and came home
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to old Nicholas, he kept his word, and having had six weeks of public
      life, never tried it any more. He went to sleep in the town-hall at the
      very next meeting; and, in full proof of his sincerity, has requested us
      to write this faithful narrative. We wish it could have the effect of
      reminding the Tulrumbles of another sphere, that puffed-up conceit is not
      dignity, and that snarling at the little pleasures they were once glad to
      enjoy, because they would rather forget the times when they were of lower
      station, renders them objects of contempt and ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the first time we have published any of our gleanings from this
      particular source. Perhaps, at some future period, we may venture to open
      the chronicles of Mudfog. FULL REPORT OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE MUDFOG
      ASSOCIATION for the advancement of everything
    </p>
    <p>
      We have made the most unparalleled and extraordinary exertions to place
      before our readers a complete and accurate account of the proceedings at
      the late grand meeting of the Mudfog Association, holden in the town of
      Mudfog; it affords us great happiness to lay the result before them, in
      the shape of various communications received from our able, talented, and
      graphic correspondent, expressly sent down for the purpose, who has
      immortalized us, himself, Mudfog, and the association, all at one and the
      same time. We have been, indeed, for some days unable to determine who
      will transmit the greatest name to posterity; ourselves, who sent our
      correspondent down; our correspondent, who wrote an account of the matter;
      or the association, who gave our correspondent something to write about.
      We rather incline to the opinion that we are the greatest man of the
      party, inasmuch as the notion of an exclusive and authentic report
      originated with us; this may be prejudice: it may arise from a
      prepossession on our part in our own favour. Be it so. We have no doubt
      that every gentleman concerned in this mighty assemblage is troubled with
      the same complaint in a greater or less degree; and it is a consolation to
      us to know that we have at least this feeling in common with the great
      scientific stars, the brilliant and extraordinary luminaries, whose
      speculations we record.
    </p>
    <p>
      We give our correspondent's letters in the order in which they reached us.
      Any attempt at amalgamating them into one beautiful whole, would only
      destroy that glowing tone, that dash of wildness, and rich vein of
      picturesque interest, which pervade them throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mudfog, Monday night, seven o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are in a state of great excitement here. Nothing is spoken of, but the
      approaching meeting of the association. The inn-doors are thronged with
      waiters anxiously looking for the expected arrivals; and the numerous
      bills which are wafered up in the windows of private houses, intimating
      that there are beds to let within, give the streets a very animated and
      cheerful appearance, the wafers being of a great variety of colours, and
      the monotony of printed inscriptions being relieved by every possible size
      and style of hand-writing. It is confidently rumoured that Professors
      Snore, Doze, and Wheezy have engaged three beds and a sitting-room at the
      Pig and Tinder-box. I give you the rumour as it has reached me; but I
      cannot, as yet, vouch for its accuracy. The moment I have been enabled to
      obtain any certain information upon this interesting point, you may depend
      upon receiving it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Half-past seven.

      I have just returned from a personal interview with the landlord of the
      Pig and Tinder-box. He speaks confidently of the probability of Professors
      Snore, Doze, and Wheezy taking up their residence at his house during the
      sitting of the association, but denies that the beds have been yet
      engaged; in which representation he is confirmed by the chambermaid-a girl
      of artless manners, and interesting appearance. The boots denies that it
      is at all likely that Professors Snore, Doze, and Wheezy will put up here;
      but I have reason to believe that this man has been suborned by the
      proprietor of the Original Pig, which is the opposition hotel. Amidst such
      conflicting testimony it is difficult to arrive at the real truth; but you
      may depend upon receiving authentic information upon this point the moment
      the fact is ascertained. The excitement still continues. A boy fell
      through the window of the pastrycook's shop at the corner of the
      High-street about half an hour ago, which has occasioned much confusion.
      The general impression is, that it was an accident. Pray heaven it may
      prove so!'

      'At an early hour this morning the bells of all the churches struck seven
      o'clock; the effect of which, in the present lively state of the town, was
      extremely singular. While I was at breakfast, a yellow gig, drawn by a
      dark grey horse, with a patch of white over his right eyelid, proceeded at
      a rapid pace in the direction of the Original Pig stables; it is currently
      reported that this gentleman has arrived here for the purpose of attending
      the association, and, from what I have heard, I consider it extremely
      probable, although nothing decisive is yet known regarding him. You may
      conceive the anxiety with which we are all looking forward to the arrival
      of the four o'clock coach this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Notwithstanding the excited state of the populace, no outrage has yet
      been committed, owing to the admirable discipline and discretion of the
      police, who are nowhere to be seen. A barrel-organ is playing opposite my
      window, and groups of people, offering fish and vegetables for sale,
      parade the streets. With these exceptions everything is quiet, and I trust
      will continue so.'

      'It is now ascertained, beyond all doubt, that Professors Snore, Doze, and
      Wheezy will not repair to the Pig and Tinder-box, but have actually
      engaged apartments at the Original Pig. This intelligence is exclusive;
      and I leave you and your readers to draw their own inferences from it. Why
      Professor Wheezy, of all people in the world, should repair to the
      Original Pig in preference to the Pig and Tinder-box, it is not easy to
      conceive. The professor is a man who should be above all such petty
      feelings. Some people here openly impute treachery, and a distinct breach
      of faith to Professors Snore and Doze; while others, again, are disposed
      to acquit them of any culpability in the transaction, and to insinuate
      that the blame rests solely with Professor Wheezy. I own that I incline to
      the latter opinion; and although it gives me great pain to speak in terms
      of censure or disapprobation of a man of such transcendent genius and
      acquirements, still I am bound to say that, if my suspicions be well
      founded, and if all the reports which have reached my ears be true, I
      really do not well know what to make of the matter.

      'Mr. Slug, so celebrated for his statistical researches, arrived this
      afternoon by the four o'clock stage. His complexion is a dark purple, and
      he has a habit of sighing constantly. He looked extremely well, and
      appeared in high health and spirits. Mr. Woodensconce also came down in
      the same conveyance. The distinguished gentleman was fast asleep on his
      arrival, and I am informed by the guard that he had been so the whole way.
      He was, no doubt, preparing for his approaching fatigues; but what
      gigantic visions must those be that flit through the brain of such a man
      when his body is in a state of torpidity!

      'The influx of visitors increases every moment. I am told (I know not how
      truly) that two post-chaises have arrived at the Original Pig within the
      last half-hour, and I myself observed a wheelbarrow, containing three
      carpet bags and a bundle, entering the yard of the Pig and Tinder- box no
      longer ago than five minutes since. The people are still quietly pursuing
      their ordinary occupations; but there is a wildness in their eyes, and an
      unwonted rigidity in the muscles of their countenances, which shows to the
      observant spectator that their expectations are strained to the very
      utmost pitch. I fear, unless some very extraordinary arrivals take place
      to-night, that consequences may arise from this popular ferment, which
      every man of sense and feeling would deplore.'

      three and sixpence for the damage done, and his constitution, it seems,
      was not strong enough to bear up against the shock. The inquest, it is
      said, will be held to-morrow.'

      once ordered dinner with great condescension. We are all very much
      delighted with the urbanity of their manners, and the ease with which they
      adapt themselves to the forms and ceremonies of ordinary life. Immediately
      on their arrival they sent for the head waiter, and privately requested
      him to purchase a live dog,-as cheap a one as he could meet with,-and to
      send him up after dinner, with a pie-board, a knife and fork, and a clean
      plate. It is conjectured that some experiments will be tried upon the dog
      to-night; if any particulars should transpire, I will forward them by
      express.'

      appearance, in good condition, and with very short legs. He has been tied
      to a curtain-peg in a dark room, and is howling dreadfully.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ten minutes to nine.
    </p>

      'The dog has just been rung for. With an instinct which would appear
      almost the result of reason, the sagacious animal seized the waiter by the
      calf of the leg when he approached to take him, and made a desperate,
      though ineffectual resistance. I have not been able to procure admission
      to the apartment occupied by the scientific gentlemen; but, judging from
      the sounds which reached my ears when I stood upon the landing-place
      outside the door, just now, I should be disposed to say that the dog had
      retreated growling beneath some article of furniture, and was keeping the
      professors at bay. This conjecture is confirmed by the testimony of the
      ostler, who, after peeping through the keyhole, assures me that he
      distinctly saw Professor Nogo on his knees, holding forth a small bottle
      of prussic acid, to which the animal, who was crouched beneath an
      arm-chair, obstinately declined to smell. You cannot imagine the feverish
      state of irritation we are in, lest the interests of science should be
      sacrificed to the prejudices of a brute creature, who is not endowed with
      sufficient sense to foresee the incalculable benefits which the whole
      human race may derive from so very slight a concession on his part.'

      which circumstance we infer that the animal is no more. His forelegs have
      been delivered to the boots to be brushed, which strengthens the
      supposition.'

      the last hour and a half, that I have scarcely strength to detail the
      rapid succession of events which have quite bewildered all those who are
      cognizant of their occurrence. It appears that the pug-dog mentioned in my
      last was surreptitiously obtained,-stolen, in fact,-by some person
      attached to the stable department, from an unmarried lady resident in this
      town. Frantic on discovering the loss of her favourite, the lady rushed
      distractedly into the street, calling in the most heart-rending and
      pathetic manner upon the passengers to restore her, her Augustus,-for so
      the deceased was named, in affectionate remembrance of a former lover of
      his mistress, to whom he bore a striking personal resemblance, which
      renders the circumstances additionally affecting. I am not yet in a
      condition to inform you what circumstance induced the bereaved lady to
      direct her steps to the hotel which had witnessed the last struggles of
      her protACgAC. I can only state that she arrived there, at the very
      instant when his detached members were passing through the passage on a
      small tray. Her shrieks still reverberate in my ears! I grieve to say that
      the expressive features of Professor Muff were much scratched and
      lacerated by the injured lady; and that Professor Nogo, besides sustaining
      several severe bites, has lost some handfuls of hair from the same cause.
      It must be some consolation to these gentlemen to know that their ardent
      attachment to scientific pursuits has alone occasioned these unpleasant
      consequences; for which the sympathy of a grateful country will
      sufficiently reward them. The unfortunate lady remains at the Pig and
      Tinder-box, and up to this time is reported in a very precarious state.

      damp and gloom upon us in the midst of our exhilaration; natural in any

      deceased animal, who appears to have been much and deservedly respected by
      the whole of his acquaintance.'

      'I take the last opportunity before sealing my parcel to inform you that
      the boy who fell through the pastrycook's window is not dead, as was
      universally believed, but alive and well. The report appears to have had
      its origin in his mysterious disappearance. He was found half an hour
      since on the premises of a sweet-stuff maker, where a raffle had been
      announced for a second-hand seal-skin cap and a tambourine; and where-a
      sufficient number of members not having been obtained at first-he had
      patiently waited until the list was completed. This fortunate discovery
      has in some degree restored our gaiety and cheerfulness. It is proposed to

      set the minds of your readers at rest. The three professors arrived at ten
      minutes after two o'clock, and, instead of taking up their quarters at the
      Original Pig, as it was universally understood in the course of yesterday
      that they would assuredly have done, drove straight to the Pig and
      Tinder-box, where they threw off the mask at once, and openly announced
      their intention of remaining. Professor Wheezy may reconcile this very
      extraordinary conduct with his notions of fair and equitable dealing, but
      I would recommend Professor Wheezy to be cautious how he presumes too far
      upon his well-earned reputation. How such a man as Professor Snore, or,
      which is still more extraordinary, such an individual as Professor Doze,
      can quietly allow himself to be mixed up with such proceedings as these,
      you will naturally inquire. Upon this head, rumour is silent; I have my
      speculations, but forbear to give utterance to them just now.'

      in the brick fields, and on the steps of doors, for which they were taken
      before the magistrates in a body this morning, and committed to prison as
      vagrants for various terms. One of these persons I understand to be a
      highly-respectable tinker, of great practical skill, who had forwarded a
      paper to the President of Section D. Mechanical Science, on the
      construction of pipkins with copper bottoms and safety- values, of which
      report speaks highly. The incarceration of this gentleman is greatly to be
      regretted, as his absence will preclude any discussion on the subject.

      secured on almost any terms. I have heard of fifteen shillings a week for
      two rooms, exclusive of coals and attendance, but I can scarcely believe
      it. The excitement is dreadful. I was informed this morning that the civil
      authorities, apprehensive of some outbreak of popular feeling, had
      commanded a recruiting sergeant and two corporals to be under arms; and
      that, with the view of not irritating the people unnecessarily by their
      presence, they had been requested to take up their position before
      daybreak in a turnpike, distant about a quarter of a mile from the town.

      the consumption of raw spirituous liquors in this place, are supposed to
      be the cause of the wretch's animosity. It is added that this declaration
      was loudly cheered by a crowd of persons who had assembled on the spot;
      and that one man had the boldness to designate Mr. Slug aloud by the
      opprobrious epithet of "Stick-in-the-mud!" It is earnestly to be hoped

      to me (it might have been a delusion of my heightened fancy) to shine with
      more than common brilliancy, and to shed a refulgent lustre upon the town,
      such as I had never observed before. This is the more extraordinary, as
      the sky was perfectly cloudless, and the atmosphere peculiarly fine. At
      half-past nine o'clock the general committee assembled, with the last
      year's president in the chair. The report of the council was read; and one
      passage, which stated that the council had corresponded with no less than
      three thousand five hundred and seventy- one persons, (all of whom paid
      their own postage,) on no fewer than seven thousand two hundred and
      forty-three topics, was received with a degree of enthusiasm which no

      brilliant rays, bringing out in strong relief the noble visages of the
      professors and scientific gentlemen, who, some with bald heads, some with
      red heads, some with brown heads, some with grey heads, some with black
      heads, some with block heads, presented a coup d'oeil which no eye-witness
      will readily forget. In front of these gentlemen were papers and
      inkstands; and round the room, on elevated benches extending as far as the
      forms could reach, were assembled a brilliant concourse of those lovely
      and elegant women for which Mudfog is justly acknowledged to be without a
      rival in the whole world. The contrast between their fair faces and the
      dark coats and trousers of the scientific gentlemen I shall never cease to

      'Time having been allowed for a slight confusion, occasioned by the
      falling down of the greater part of the platforms, to subside, the
      president called on one of the secretaries to read a communication
      entitled, "Some remarks on the industrious fleas, with considerations on
      the importance of establishing infant-schools among that numerous class of
      society; of directing their industry to useful and practical ends; and of
      applying the surplus fruits thereof, towards providing for them a
      comfortable and respectable maintenance in their old age."

    <p>
      'The author stated, that, having long turned his attention to the moral
      and social condition of these interesting animals, he had been induced to
      visit an exhibition in Regent-street, London, commonly known by the
      designation of "The Industrious Fleas." He had there seen many fleas,
      occupied certainly in various pursuits and avocations, but occupied, he
      was bound to add, in a manner which no man of well-regulated mind could
      fail to regard with sorrow and regret. One flea, reduced to the level of a
      beast of burden, was drawing about a miniature gig, containing a
      particularly small effigy of His Grace the Duke of Wellington; while
      another was staggering beneath the weight of a golden model of his great
      adversary Napoleon Bonaparte. Some, brought up as mountebanks and
      ballet-dancers, were performing a figure-dance (he regretted to observe,
      that, of the fleas so employed, several were females); others were in
      training, in a small card-board box, for pedestrians,-mere sporting
      characters-and two were actually engaged in the cold-blooded and barbarous
      occupation of duelling; a pursuit from which humanity recoiled with horror
      and disgust. He suggested that measures should be immediately taken to
      employ the labour of these fleas as part and parcel of the productive
      power of the country, which might easily be done by the establishment
      among them of infant schools and houses of industry, in which a system of
      virtuous education, based upon sound principles, should be observed, and
      moral precepts strictly inculcated. He proposed that every flea who
      presumed to exhibit, for hire, music, or dancing, or any species of
      theatrical entertainment, without a licence, should be considered a
      vagabond, and treated accordingly; in which respect he only placed him
      upon a level with the rest of mankind. He would further suggest that their
      labour should be placed under the control and regulation of the state, who
      should set apart from the profits, a fund for the support of superannuated
      or disabled fleas, their widows and orphans. With this view, he proposed
      that liberal premiums should be offered for the three best designs for a
      general almshouse; from which-as insect architecture was well known to be
      in a very advanced and perfect state-we might possibly derive many
      valuable hints for the improvement of our metropolitan universities,
      national galleries, and other public edifices.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The President wished to be informed how the ingenious gentleman proposed
      to open a communication with fleas generally, in the first instance, so
      that they might be thoroughly imbued with a sense of the advantages they
      must necessarily derive from changing their mode of life, and applying
      themselves to honest labour. This appeared to him, the only difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Author submitted that this difficulty was easily overcome, or rather
      that there was no difficulty at all in the case. Obviously the course to
      be pursued, if Her Majesty's government could be prevailed upon to take up
      the plan, would be, to secure at a remunerative salary the individual to
      whom he had alluded as presiding over the exhibition in Regent-street at
      the period of his visit. That gentleman would at once be able to put
      himself in communication with the mass of the fleas, and to instruct them
      in pursuance of some general plan of education, to be sanctioned by
      Parliament, until such time as the more intelligent among them were
      advanced enough to officiate as teachers to the rest.

      'The President and several members of the section highly complimented the

      that by scooping out the head, which would afford a new and delicious
      species of nourishment for the poor, a parachute, in principle something
      similar to that constructed by M. Garnerin, was at once obtained; the
      stalk of course being kept downwards. He added that he was perfectly
      willing to make a descent from a height of not less than three miles and a
      quarter; and had in fact already proposed the same to the proprietors of
      Vauxhall Gardens, who in the handsomest manner at once consented to his
      wishes, and appointed an early day next summer for the undertaking; merely
      stipulating that the rim of the cauliflower should be previously broken in
      three or four places to ensure the safety of the descent.

      and distinctly proved that he could have no near relatives in the
      profession, as many designing persons had falsely stated, inasmuch as his
      father, mother, brothers and sisters, had all fallen victims to the
      butcher at different times. An uncle of his indeed, had with very great
      labour been traced to a sty in Somers Town; but as he was in a very infirm
      state at the time, being afflicted with measles, and shortly afterwards
      disappeared, there appeared too much reason to conjecture that he had been
      converted into sausages. The disorder of the learned pig was originally a
      severe cold, which, being aggravated by excessive trough indulgence,
      finally settled upon the lungs, and terminated in a general decay of the
      constitution. A melancholy instance of a presentiment entertained by the
      animal of his approaching dissolution, was recorded. After gratifying a
      numerous and fashionable company with his performances, in which no
      falling off whatever was visible, he fixed his eyes on the biographer,
      and, turning to the watch which lay on the floor, and on which he was
      accustomed to point out the hour, deliberately passed his snout twice
      round the dial. In precisely four-and-twenty hours from that time he had
      ceased to exist!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Professor Wheezy inquired whether, previous to his demise, the animal had
      expressed, by signs or otherwise, any wishes regarding the disposal of his
      little property.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Blunderum replied, that, when the biographer took up the pack of
      cards at the conclusion of the performance, the animal grunted several
      times in a significant manner, and nodding his head as he was accustomed
      to do, when gratified. From these gestures it was understood that he
      wished the attendant to keep the cards, which he had ever since done. He
      had not expressed any wish relative to his watch, which had accordingly
      been pawned by the same individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The President wished to know whether any Member of the section had ever
      seen or conversed with the pig-faced lady, who was reported to have worn a
      black velvet mask, and to have taken her meals from a golden trough.
    </p>
    <p>
      'After some hesitation a Member replied that the pig-faced lady was his
      mother-in-law, and that he trusted the President would not violate the
      sanctity of private life.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The President begged pardon. He had considered the pig-faced lady a
      public character. Would the honourable member object to state, with a view
      to the advancement of science, whether she was in any way connected with
      the learned pig?
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Member replied in the same low tone, that, as the question appeared
      to involve a suspicion that the learned pig might be his half-brother, he
      must decline answering it. 'SECTION B.-ANATOMY AND MEDICINE. COACH- HOUSE,

      Dr. Kutankumagen (of Moscow) read to the section a report of a case which
      had occurred within his own practice, strikingly illustrative of the power
      of medicine, as exemplified in his successful treatment of a virulent
      disorder. He had been called in to visit the patient on the 1st of April,
      1837. He was then labouring under symptoms peculiarly alarming to any
      medical man. His frame was stout and muscular, his step firm and elastic,
      his cheeks plump and red, his voice loud, his appetite good, his pulse
      full and round. He was in the constant habit of eating three meals per
      diem, and of drinking at least one bottle of wine, and one glass of
      spirituous liquors diluted with water, in the course of the
      four-and-twenty hours. He laughed constantly, and in so hearty a manner
      that it was terrible to hear him. By dint of powerful medicine, low diet,
      and bleeding, the symptoms in the course of three days perceptibly
      decreased. A rigid perseverance in the same course of treatment for only
      one week, accompanied with small doses of water-gruel, weak broth, and
      barley-water, led to their entire disappearance. In the course of a month
      he was sufficiently recovered to be carried down-stairs by two nurses, and
      to enjoy an airing in a close carriage, supported by soft pillows. At the
      present moment he was restored so far as to walk about, with the slight
      assistance of a crutch and a boy. It would perhaps be gratifying to the
      section to learn that he ate little, drank little, slept little, and was
      never heard to laugh by any accident whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dr. W. R. Fee, in complimenting the honourable member upon the triumphant
      cure he had effected, begged to ask whether the patient still bled freely?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dr. Kutankumagen replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dr. W. R. Fee.-And you found that he bled freely during the whole course
      of the disorder?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dr. Kutankumagen.-Oh dear, yes; most freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dr. Neeshawts supposed, that if the patient had not submitted to be bled
      with great readiness and perseverance, so extraordinary a cure could
      never, in fact, have been accomplished. Dr. Kutankumagen rejoined,
      certainly not.

      'Mr. Knight Bell (M.R.C.S.) exhibited a wax preparation of the interior of
      a gentleman who in early life had inadvertently swallowed a door-key. It
      was a curious fact that a medical student of dissipated habits, being
      present at the post mortem examination, found means to escape unobserved
      from the room, with that portion of the coats of the stomach upon which an
      exact model of the instrument was distinctly impressed, with which he
      hastened to a locksmith of doubtful character, who made a new key from the
      pattern so shown to him. With this key the medical student entered the
      house of the deceased gentleman, and committed a burglary to a large
      amount, for which he was subsequently tried and executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The President wished to know what became of the original key after the
      lapse of years. Mr. Knight Bell replied that the gentleman was always much
      accustomed to punch, and it was supposed the acid had gradually devoured
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dr. Neeshawts and several of the members were of opinion that the key
      must have lain very cold and heavy upon the gentleman's stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Knight Bell believed it did at first. It was worthy of remark,
      perhaps, that for some years the gentleman was troubled with a night-
      mare, under the influence of which he always imagined himself a wine-
      cellar door.

      'Professor Muff related a very extraordinary and convincing proof of the
      wonderful efficacy of the system of infinitesimal doses, which the section
      were doubtless aware was based upon the theory that the very minutest
      amount of any given drug, properly dispersed through the human frame,
      would be productive of precisely the same result as a very large dose
      administered in the usual manner. Thus, the fortieth part of a grain of
      calomel was supposed to be equal to a five-grain calomel pill, and so on
      in proportion throughout the whole range of medicine. He had tried the
      experiment in a curious manner upon a publican who had been brought into
      the hospital with a broken head, and was cured upon the infinitesimal
      system in the incredibly short space of three months. This man was a hard
      drinker. He (Professor Muff) had dispersed three drops of rum through a
      bucket of water, and requested the man to drink the whole. What was the
      result? Before he had drunk a quart, he was in a state of beastly
      intoxication; and five other men were made dead drunk with the remainder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The President wished to know whether an infinitesimal dose of soda- water
      would have recovered them? Professor Muff replied that the twenty-fifth
      part of a teaspoonful, properly administered to each patient, would have
      sobered him immediately. The President remarked that this was a most
      important discovery, and he hoped the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen
      would patronize it immediately.
    </p>

      'A Member begged to be informed whether it would be possible to
      administer-say, the twentieth part of a grain of bread and cheese to all
      grown-up paupers, and the fortieth part to children, with the same
      satisfying effect as their present allowance.

    <p>
      'Professor Muff was willing to stake his professional reputation on the
      perfect adequacy of such a quantity of food to the support of human
      life-in workhouses; the addition of the fifteenth part of a grain of
      pudding twice a week would render it a high diet.

      extraordinary case of animal magnetism. A private watchman, being merely
      looked at by the operator from the opposite side of a wide street, was at
      once observed to be in a very drowsy and languid state. He was followed to
      his box, and being once slightly rubbed on the palms of the hands, fell

      four and a half to one; and that the preponderance of Valentine and Orsons
      over Goody Two Shoeses was as three and an eighth of the former to half a
      one of the latter; a comparison of Seven Champions with Simple Simons gave
      the same result. The ignorance that prevailed, was lamentable. One child,
      on being asked whether he would rather be Saint George of England or a
      respectable tallow-chandler, instantly replied, "Taint George of Ingling."
      Another, a little boy of eight years old, was found to be firmly impressed
      with a belief in the existence of dragons, and openly stated that it was
      his intention when he grew up, to rush forth sword in hand for the
      deliverance of captive princesses, and the promiscuous slaughter of
      giants. Not one child among the number interrogated had ever heard of
      Mungo Park,-some inquiring whether he was at all connected with the black
      man that swept the crossing; and others whether he was in any way related
      to the Regent's Park. They had not the slightest conception of the
      commonest principles of mathematics, and considered Sindbad the Sailor the

      laborious and useful occupation,-supposing the family linen was being
      washed, for instance.

      'Mr. Slug then stated some curious calculations respecting the dogs'- meat
      barrows of London. He found that the total number of small carts and
      barrows engaged in dispensing provision to the cats and dogs of the
      metropolis was, one thousand seven hundred and forty-three. The average
      number of skewers delivered daily with the provender, by each dogs'-meat
      cart or barrow, was thirty-six. Now, multiplying the number of skewers so
      delivered by the number of barrows, a total of sixty-two thousand seven
      hundred and forty-eight skewers daily would be obtained. Allowing that, of
      these sixty-two thousand seven hundred and forty-eight skewers, the odd
      two thousand seven hundred and forty-eight were accidentally devoured with
      the meat, by the most voracious of the animals supplied, it followed that
      sixty thousand skewers per day, or the enormous number of twenty-one
      millions nine hundred thousand skewers annually, were wasted in the
      kennels and dustholes of London; which, if collected and warehoused, would
      in ten years' time afford a mass of timber more than sufficient for the
      construction of a first-rate vessel of war for the use of her Majesty's

      necessary to have a level, but he had provided for this difficulty by
      proposing that the best line that the circumstances would admit of, should
      be taken through the sewers which undermine the streets of the metropolis,
      and which, well lighted by jets from the gas pipes which run immediately
      above them, would form a pleasant and commodious arcade, especially in
      winter-time, when the inconvenient custom of carrying umbrellas, now so
      general, could be wholly dispensed with. In reply to another question,
      Professor Queerspeck stated that no substitute for the purposes to which

      the strings being always pulled by the directors of the company to which
      the machine belonged. The quicksilver was so ingeniously placed, that when
      the acting directors held shares in their pockets, figures denoting very
      small expenses and very large returns appeared upon the glass; but the
      moment the directors parted with these pieces of paper, the estimate of

      without falling into the street. The Professor stated that the number of

      taken the shelf above me, and Mr. Slug and Professor Grime the two shelves
      opposite. Their luggage has already arrived. On Mr. Slug's bed is a long
      tin tube of about three inches in diameter, carefully closed at both ends.

      which gave me some uneasiness at first; but as the steward says it is
      always there, and never goes away, I am quite comfortable again. I learn
      from this man that the different sections will be distributed at the Black
      Boy and Stomach-ache, and the Boot-jack and Countenance. If this

      arrived upon the wharf, and all is bustle and activity. The noise and
      confusion are very great. Cloths are laid in the cabins, and the steward
      is placing blue plates-full of knobs of cheese at equal distances down the
      centre of the tables. He drops a great many knobs; but, being used to it,
      picks them up again with great dexterity, and, after wiping them on his
      sleeve, throws them back into the plates. He is a young man of exceedingly
      prepossessing appearance-either dirty or a mulatto, but I think the

      it in safety; but the board he has to cross is narrow and slippery. Was

      of his, and is to have his supper handed up by a boy. I have had the
      honour to introduce myself to these gentlemen, and we have amicably
      arranged the order in which we shall retire to rest; which it is necessary
      to agree upon, because, although the cabin is very comfortable, there is

      There has been some discussion whether the payment should be decided by
      the first toss or the best out of three. Eventually the latter course has
      been determined on. Deeply do I wish that both gentlemen could win; but
      that being impossible, I own that my personal aspirations (I speak as an
      individual, and do not compromise either you or your readers by this

      it would be a "head" beforehand, with many other remarks of a similar
      nature. Surely this gentleman is not so lost to every feeling of decency
      and propriety as not to feel and know the superiority of Professor
      Woodensconce? Is Professor Grime insane? or does he wish to be reminded in
      plain language of his true position in society, and the precise level of

      of a flickering lamp suspended from the ceiling; Professor Grime is lying
      on the opposite shelf on the broad of his back, with his mouth wide open.
      The scene is indescribably solemn. The rippling of the tide, the noise of
      the sailors' feet overhead, the gruff voices on the river, the dogs on the
      shore, the snoring of the passengers, and a constant creaking of every
      plank in the vessel, are the only sounds that meet the ear. With these
      exceptions, all is profound silence.

      who lies above Professor Grime, has cautiously withdrawn the curtains of
      his berth, and, after looking anxiously out, as if to satisfy himself that
      his companions are asleep, has taken up the tin tube of which I have
      before spoken, and is regarding it with great interest. What rare
      mechanical combination can be contained in that mysterious case? It is
      evidently a profound secret to all.'

      clearly on the eve of some great experiment. Pray heaven that it be not a

      Woodensconce (who had ascended to his berth by means of a platform of
      carpet-bags arranged by himself on geometrical principals) darted from his
      shelf head foremost, and, gaining his feet with all the rapidity of
      extreme terror, ran wildly into the ladies' cabin, under the impression
      that we were sinking, and uttering loud cries for aid. I am assured that
      the scene which ensued baffles all description. There were one hundred and
      forty-seven ladies in their respective berths at the time.

      of the steam-engine as applied to purposes of navigation, that in whatever
      part of the vessel a passenger's berth may be situated, the machinery
      always appears to be exactly under his pillow. He intends stating this

      steamer is, that it always carries a little storm with it. You can

      entangled in the machinery while he was explaining to a knot of ladies the

      beautiful expanse of country, with red brick buildings on either side, and
      stopping in the marketplace to observe the spot where Mr. Kwakley's hat
      was blown off yesterday. It is an uneven piece of paving, but has
      certainly no appearance which would lead one to suppose that any such
      event had recently occurred there. From this point I proceeded-passing the
      gas-works and tallow-melter's-to a lane which had been pointed out to me
      as the beadle's place of residence; and before I had driven a dozen yards
      further, I had the good fortune to meet Sowster himself advancing towards
      me.

      conformation of countenance which is vulgarly termed a double chin than I

      attributes to a habit of early rising-so red, indeed, that but for this
      explanation I should have supposed it to proceed from occasional
      inebriety. He informed me that he did not feel himself at liberty to
      relate what had passed between himself and Professor Pumpkinskull, but had
      no objection to state that it was connected with a matter of police
      regulation, and added with peculiar significance "Never wos sitch times!"

      waiting on Professor Pumpkinskull, and stating the object of my visit.
      After a few moments' reflection, the Professor, who, I am bound to say,
      behaved with the utmost politeness, openly avowed (I mark the passage in
      italics) that he had requested Sowster to attend on the Monday morning at
      the Boot-jack and Countenance, to keep off the boys; and that he had

      assembled, to enforce the law against people who come upon the parish, and
      other offenders, has any lawful authority whatever over the rising youth
      of this country. I have yet to learn that a beadle can be called out by
      any civilian to exercise a domination and despotism over the boys of
      Britain. I have yet to learn that a beadle will be permitted by the
      commissioners of poor law regulation to wear out the soles and heels of
      his boots in illegal interference with the liberties of people not proved
      poor or otherwise criminal. I have yet to learn that a beadle has power to
      stop up the Queen's highway at his will and pleasure, or that the whole
      width of the street is not free and open to any man, boy, or woman in

      'Mr. X. X. Misty communicated some remarks on the disappearance of
      dancing-bears from the streets of London, with observations on the
      exhibition of monkeys as connected with barrel-organs. The writer had
      observed, with feelings of the utmost pain and regret, that some years ago
      a sudden and unaccountable change in the public taste took place with
      reference to itinerant bears, who, being discountenanced by the populace,
      gradually fell off one by one from the streets of the metropolis, until
      not one remained to create a taste for natural history in the breasts of
      the poor and uninstructed. One bear, indeed,-a brown and ragged
      animal,-had lingered about the haunts of his former triumphs, with a worn
      and dejected visage and feeble limbs, and had essayed to wield his
      quarter-staff for the amusement of the multitude; but hunger, and an utter
      want of any due recompense for his abilities, had at length driven him
      from the field, and it was only too probable that he had fallen a
      sacrifice to the rising taste for grease. He regretted to add that a
      similar, and no less lamentable, change had taken place with reference to
      monkeys. These delightful animals had formerly been almost as plentiful as
      the organs on the tops of which they were accustomed to sit; the
      proportion in the year 1829 (it appeared by the parliamentary return)
      being as one monkey to three organs. Owing, however, to an altered taste
      in musical instruments, and the substitution, in a great measure, of
      narrow boxes of music for organs, which left the monkeys nothing to sit
      upon, this source of public amusement was wholly dried up. Considering it
      a matter of the deepest importance, in connection with national education,
      that the people should not lose such opportunities of making themselves
      acquainted with the manners and customs of two most interesting species of
      animals, the author submitted that some measures should be immediately
      taken for the restoration of these pleasing and truly intellectual
      amusements.

      accomplished, if Her Majesty's Government would cause to be brought over
      to England, and maintained at the public expense, and for the public
      amusement, such a number of bears as would enable every quarter of the
      town to be visited-say at least by three bears a week. No difficulty
      whatever need be experienced in providing a fitting place for the
      reception of these animals, as a commodious bear-garden could be erected

      ably adverted. On the contrary, he believed that they had been the means
      of diffusing very incorrect and imperfect notions on the subject. He spoke
      from personal observation and personal experience, when he said that many
      children of great abilities had been induced to believe, from what they
      had observed in the streets, at and before the period to which the
      honourable gentleman had referred, that all monkeys were born in red coats
      and spangles, and that their hats and feathers also came by nature. He
      wished to know distinctly whether the honourable gentleman attributed the
      want of encouragement the bears had met with to the decline of public
      taste in that respect, or to a want of ability on the part of the bears
      themselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. X. X. Misty replied, that he could not bring himself to believe but
      that there must be a great deal of floating talent among the bears and
      monkeys generally; which, in the absence of any proper encouragement, was
      dispersed in other directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Professor Pumpkinskull wished to take that opportunity of calling the
      attention of the section to a most important and serious point. The author
      of the treatise just read had alluded to the prevalent taste for
      bears'-grease as a means of promoting the growth of hair, which
      undoubtedly was diffused to a very great and (as it appeared to him) very
      alarming extent. No gentleman attending that section could fail to be
      aware of the fact that the youth of the present age evinced, by their
      behaviour in the streets, and at all places of public resort, a
      considerable lack of that gallantry and gentlemanly feeling which, in more
      ignorant times, had been thought becoming. He wished to know whether it
      were possible that a constant outward application of bears'- grease by the
      young gentlemen about town had imperceptibly infused into those unhappy
      persons something of the nature and quality of the bear. He shuddered as
      he threw out the remark; but if this theory, on inquiry, should prove to
      be well founded, it would at once explain a great deal of unpleasant
      eccentricity of behaviour, which, without some such discovery, was wholly
      unaccountable.

      'The President highly complimented the learned gentleman on his most
      valuable suggestion, which produced the greatest effect upon the assembly;

      a theatre eyeing a box of ladies with a fierce intensity, which nothing
      but the influence of some brutish appetite could possibly explain. It was
      dreadful to reflect that our youth were so rapidly verging into a
      generation of bears.

      glee-singers had been committed to prison as criminals by a late most
      zealous police-magistrate of the metropolis, the dogs had abandoned their
      professional duties, and dispersed themselves in different quarters of the
      town to gain a livelihood by less dangerous means. He was given to
      understand that since that period they had supported themselves by lying
      in wait for and robbing blind men's poodles.

      boughs the great family of mankind. The learned gentleman remarked that

      and composed exclusively of steel, by the aid of which more pockets could
      be picked in one hour than by the present slow and tedious process in

      never been once known to fail.

      and what means for bringing it into general operation?

      difficulties, he had succeeded in putting himself in communication with
      Mr. Fogle Hunter, and other gentlemen connected with the swell mob, who
      had awarded the invention the very highest and most unqualified
      approbation. He regretted to say, however, that these distinguished
      practitioners, in common with a gentleman of the name of Gimlet-eyed
      Tommy, and other members of a secondary grade of the profession whom he
      was understood to represent, entertained an insuperable objection to its
      being brought into general use, on the ground that it would have the
      inevitable effect of almost entirely superseding manual labour, and
      throwing a great number of highly-deserving persons out of employment.

      should apply to Parliament, which he thought could not fail to recognise
      the utility of the invention.

      on very well without it; but, as they did their business on a very large

      fear was that the machine might be worn out by constant working.

      'Mr. Coppernose called the attention of the section to a proposition of
      great magnitude and interest, illustrated by a vast number of models, and
      stated with much clearness and perspicuity in a treatise entitled
      "Practical Suggestions on the necessity of providing some harmless and
      wholesome relaxation for the young noblemen of England." His proposition
      was, that a space of ground of not less than ten miles in length and four
      in breadth should be purchased by a new company, to be incorporated by Act
      of Parliament, and inclosed by a brick wall of not less than twelve feet
      in height. He proposed that it should be laid out with highway roads,
      turnpikes, bridges, miniature villages, and every object that could
      conduce to the comfort and glory of Four-in-hand Clubs, so that they might
      be fairly presumed to require no drive beyond it. This delightful retreat
      would be fitted up with most commodious and extensive stables, for the
      convenience of such of the nobility and gentry as had a taste for
      ostlering, and with houses of entertainment furnished in the most
      expensive and handsome style. It would be further provided with whole
      streets of door-knockers and bell-handles of extra size, so constructed
      that they could be easily wrenched off at night, and regularly screwed on
      again, by attendants provided for the purpose, every day. There would also
      be gas lamps of real glass, which could be broken at a comparatively small
      expense per dozen, and a broad and handsome foot pavement for gentlemen to
      drive their cabriolets upon when they were humorously disposed-for the
      full enjoyment of which feat live pedestrians would be procured from the
      workhouse at a very small charge per head. The place being inclosed, and
      carefully screened from the intrusion of the public, there would be no
      objection to gentlemen laying aside any article of their costume that was
      considered to interfere with a pleasant frolic, or, indeed, to their
      walking about without any costume at all, if they liked that better. In
      short, every facility of enjoyment would be afforded that the most
      gentlemanly person could possibly desire. But as even these advantages
      would be incomplete unless there were some means provided of enabling the
      nobility and gentry to display their prowess when they sallied forth after
      dinner, and as some inconvenience might be experienced in the event of
      their being reduced to the necessity of pummelling each other, the
      inventor had turned his attention to the construction of an entirely new
      police force, composed exclusively of automaton figures, which, with the
      assistance of the ingenious Signor Gagliardi, of Windmill-street, in the
      Haymarket, he had succeeded in making with such nicety, that a policeman,
      cab-driver, or old woman, made upon the principle of the models exhibited,
      would walk about until knocked down like any real man; nay, more, if set
      upon and beaten by six or eight noblemen or gentlemen, after it was down,
      the figure would utter divers groans, mingled with entreaties for mercy,
      thus rendering the illusion complete, and the enjoyment perfect. But the
      invention did not stop even here; for station-houses would be built,
      containing good beds for noblemen and gentlemen during the night, and in
      the morning they would repair to a commodious police office, where a
      pantomimic investigation would take place before the automaton
      magistrates,-quite equal to life,-who would fine them in so many counters,
      with which they would be previously provided for the purpose. This office
      would be furnished with an inclined plane, for the convenience of any
      nobleman or gentleman who might wish to bring in his horse as a witness;
      and the prisoners would be at perfect liberty, as they were now, to
      interrupt the complainants as much as they pleased, and to make any
      remarks that they thought proper. The charge for these amusements would
      amount to very little more than they already cost, and the inventor
      submitted that the public would be much benefited and comforted by the
      proposed arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Professor Nogo wished to be informed what amount of automaton police
      force it was proposed to raise in the first instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Coppernose replied, that it was proposed to begin with seven
      divisions of police of a score each, lettered from A to G inclusive. It
      was proposed that not more than half this number should be placed on
      active duty, and that the remainder should be kept on shelves in the
      police office ready to be called out at a moment's notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The President, awarding the utmost merit to the ingenious gentleman who
      had originated the idea, doubted whether the automaton police would quite
      answer the purpose. He feared that noblemen and gentlemen would perhaps
      require the excitement of thrashing living subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Coppernose submitted, that as the usual odds in such cases were ten
      noblemen or gentlemen to one policeman or cab-driver, it could make very
      little difference in point of excitement whether the policeman or cab-
      driver were a man or a block. The great advantage would be, that a
      policeman's limbs might be all knocked off, and yet he would be in a
      condition to do duty next day. He might even give his evidence next
      morning with his head in his hand, and give it equally well.

      'Professor Nogo.-I see but one objection to it. It appears to me that the
      magistrates ought to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Coppernose no sooner heard this suggestion than he touched a small
      spring in each of the two models of magistrates which were placed upon the
      table; one of the figures immediately began to exclaim with great
      volubility that he was sorry to see gentlemen in such a situation, and the
      other to express a fear that the policeman was intoxicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The section, as with one accord, declared with a shout of applause that
      the invention was complete; and the President, much excited, retired with
      Mr. Coppernose to lay it before the council. On his return,

      principle of the human eye.

      West India plantations, while they could discern nothing whatever in the
      interior of Manchester cotton mills. He must know, too, with what
      quickness of perception most people could discover their neighbour's
      faults, and how very blind they were to their own. If the President
      differed from the great majority of men in this respect, his eye was a

      and described the course of treatment he had pursued with perfect success.
      The patient was a married lady in the middle rank of life, who, having
      seen another lady at an evening party in a full suit of pearls, was
      suddenly seized with a desire to possess a similar equipment, although her
      husband's finances were by no means equal to the necessary outlay. Finding
      her wish ungratified, she fell sick, and the symptoms soon became so
      alarming, that he (Dr. Grummidge) was called in. At this period the
      prominent tokens of the disorder were sullenness, a total indisposition to
      perform domestic duties, great peevishness, and extreme languor, except
      when pearls were mentioned, at which times the pulse quickened, the eyes
      grew brighter, the pupils dilated, and the patient, after various
      incoherent exclamations, burst into a passion of tears, and exclaimed that
      nobody cared for her, and that she wished herself dead. Finding that the
      patient's appetite was affected in the presence of company, he began by
      ordering a total abstinence from all stimulants, and forbidding any
      sustenance but weak gruel; he then took twenty ounces of blood, applied a
      blister under each ear, one upon the chest, and another on the back;
      having done which, and administered five grains of calomel, he left the
      patient to her repose. The next day she was somewhat low, but decidedly
      better, and all appearances of irritation were removed. The next day she
      improved still further, and on the next again. On the fourth there was
      some appearance of a return of the old symptoms, which no sooner developed
      themselves, than he administered another dose of calomel, and left strict
      orders that, unless a decidedly favourable change occurred within two
      hours, the patient's head should be immediately shaved to the very last
      curl. From that moment she began to mend, and, in less than
      four-and-twenty hours was perfectly restored. She did not now betray the
      least emotion at the sight or mention of pearls or any other ornaments.

      'Mr. Pipkin (M.R.C.S.) read a short but most interesting communication in
      which he sought to prove the complete belief of Sir William Courtenay,
      otherwise Thorn, recently shot at Canterbury, in the Homoeopathic system.
      The section would bear in mind that one of the Homoeopathic doctrines was,
      that infinitesimal doses of any medicine which would occasion the disease
      under which the patient laboured, supposing him to be in a healthy state,
      would cure it. Now, it was a remarkable circumstance-proved in the
      evidence-that the deceased Thorn employed a woman to follow him about all
      day with a pail of water, assuring her that one drop (a purely
      homoeopathic remedy, the section would observe), placed upon his tongue,
      after death, would restore him. What was the obvious inference? That
      Thorn, who was marching and countermarching in osier beds, and other
      swampy places, was impressed with a presentiment that he should be
      drowned; in which case, had his instructions been complied with, he could
      not fail to have been brought to life again instantly by his own
      prescription. As it was, if this woman, or any other person, had
      administered an infinitesimal dose of lead and gunpowder immediately after
      he fell, he would have recovered forthwith. But unhappily the woman
      concerned did not possess the power of reasoning by analogy, or carrying
      out a principle, and thus the unfortunate gentleman had been sacrificed to
      the ignorance of the peasantry. 'SECTION D.-STATISTICS. OUT-HOUSE, BLACK

      an average of the same. (Great laughter.) It was pretty well known that

      with temporary qualifications, to the ownership of which they swore

      'A paper was read by the secretary descriptive of a bay pony with one eye,
      which had been seen by the author standing in a butcher's cart at the
      corner of Newgate Market. The communication described the author of the
      paper as having, in the prosecution of a mercantile pursuit, betaken
      himself one Saturday morning last summer from Somers Town to Cheapside; in
      the course of which expedition he had beheld the extraordinary appearance
      above described. The pony had one distinct eye, and it had been pointed
      out to him by his friend Captain Blunderbore, of the Horse Marines, who
      assisted the author in his search, that whenever he winked this eye he
      whisked his tail (possibly to drive the flies off), but that he always
      winked and whisked at the same time. The animal was lean, spavined, and
      tottering; and the author proposed to constitute it of the family of
      Fitfordogsmeataurious. It certainly did occur to him that there was no
      case on record of a pony with one clearly-defined and distinct organ of
      vision, winking and whisking at the same moment.

      of a pony whisking his tail, but whether they were two ponies or the same
      pony he could not undertake positively to say. At all events, he was
      acquainted with no authenticated instance of a simultaneous winking and
      whisking, and he really could not but doubt the existence of such a
      marvellous pony in opposition to all those natural laws by which ponies
      were governed. Referring, however, to the mere question of his one organ
      of vision, might he suggest the possibility of this pony having been
      literally half asleep at the time he was seen, and having closed only one
      eye.

      had certainly never seen anything analogous to this pony, but he was not
      prepared to doubt its existence; for he had seen many queerer ponies in

      vile the 'sociation's in the town. Hand over, vill you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'With these words, Professor Ketch hastily repossessed himself of the
      cocoa-nut, and drew forth the skull, in mistake for which he had exhibited
      it. A most interesting conversation ensued; but as there appeared some
      doubt ultimately whether the skull was Mr. Greenacre's, or a hospital
      patient's, or a pauper's, or a man's, or a woman's, or a monkey's, no
      particular result was obtained.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot,' says our talented correspondent in conclusion, 'I cannot close
      my account of these gigantic researches and sublime and noble triumphs
      without repeating a bon mot of Professor Woodensconce's, which shows how
      the greatest minds may occasionally unbend when truth can be presented to
      listening ears, clothed in an attractive and playful form. I was standing
      by, when, after a week of feasting and feeding, that learned gentleman,
      accompanied by the whole body of wonderful men, entered the hall
      yesterday, where a sumptuous dinner was prepared; where the richest wines
      sparkled on the board, and fat bucks-propitiatory sacrifices to
      learning-sent forth their savoury odours. "Ah!" said Professor
      Woodensconce, rubbing his hands, "this is what we meet for; this is what
      inspires us; this is what keeps us together, and beckons us onward; this
      is the spread of science, and a glorious spread it is."' THE PANTOMIME OF
      LIFE
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we plunge headlong into this paper, let us at once confess to a
      fondness for pantomimes-to a gentle sympathy with clowns and pantaloons-to
      an unqualified admiration of harlequins and columbines-to a chaste delight
      in every action of their brief existence, varied and many-coloured as
      those actions are, and inconsistent though they occasionally be with those
      rigid and formal rules of propriety which regulate the proceedings of
      meaner and less comprehensive minds. We revel in pantomimes-not because
      they dazzle one's eyes with tinsel and gold leaf; not because they present
      to us, once again, the well-beloved chalked faces, and goggle eyes of our
      childhood; not even because, like Christmas-day, and Twelfth-night, and
      Shrove-Tuesday, and one's own birthday, they come to us but once a
      year;-our attachment is founded on a graver and a very different reason. A
      pantomime is to us, a mirror of life; nay, more, we maintain that it is so
      to audiences generally, although they are not aware of it, and that this
      very circumstance is the secret cause of their amusement and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take a slight example. The scene is a street: an elderly gentleman,
      with a large face and strongly marked features, appears. His countenance
      beams with a sunny smile, and a perpetual dimple is on his broad, red
      cheek. He is evidently an opulent elderly gentleman, comfortable in
      circumstances, and well-to-do in the world. He is not unmindful of the
      adornment of his person, for he is richly, not to say gaudily, dressed;
      and that he indulges to a reasonable extent in the pleasures of the table
      may be inferred from the joyous and oily manner in which he rubs his
      stomach, by way of informing the audience that he is going home to dinner.
      In the fulness of his heart, in the fancied security of wealth, in the
      possession and enjoyment of all the good things of life, the elderly
      gentleman suddenly loses his footing, and stumbles. How the audience roar!
      He is set upon by a noisy and officious crowd, who buffet and cuff him
      unmercifully. They scream with delight! Every time the elderly gentleman
      struggles to get up, his relentless persecutors knock him down again. The
      spectators are convulsed with merriment! And when at last the elderly
      gentleman does get up, and staggers away, despoiled of hat, wig, and
      clothing, himself battered to pieces, and his watch and money gone, they
      are exhausted with laughter, and express their merriment and admiration in
      rounds of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this like life? Change the scene to any real street;-to the Stock
      Exchange, or the City banker's; the merchant's counting-house, or even the
      tradesman's shop. See any one of these men fall,-the more suddenly, and
      the nearer the zenith of his pride and riches, the better. What a wild
      hallo is raised over his prostrate carcase by the shouting mob; how they
      whoop and yell as he lies humbled beneath them! Mark how eagerly they set
      upon him when he is down; and how they mock and deride him as he slinks
      away. Why, it is the pantomime to the very letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the pantomimic dramatis personae, we consider the pantaloon the
      most worthless and debauched. Independent of the dislike one naturally
      feels at seeing a gentleman of his years engaged in pursuits highly
      unbecoming his gravity and time of life, we cannot conceal from ourselves
      the fact that he is a treacherous, worldly-minded old villain, constantly
      enticing his younger companion, the clown, into acts of fraud or petty
      larceny, and generally standing aside to watch the result of the
      enterprise. If it be successful, he never forgets to return for his share
      of the spoil; but if it turn out a failure, he generally retires with
      remarkable caution and expedition, and keeps carefully aloof until the
      affair has blown over. His amorous propensities, too, are eminently
      disagreeable; and his mode of addressing ladies in the open street at
      noon-day is down-right improper, being usually neither more nor less than
      a perceptible tickling of the aforesaid ladies in the waist, after
      committing which, he starts back, manifestly ashamed (as well he may be)
      of his own indecorum and temerity; continuing, nevertheless, to ogle and
      beckon to them from a distance in a very unpleasant and immoral manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any man who cannot count a dozen pantaloons in his own social
      circle? Is there any man who has not seen them swarming at the west end of
      the town on a sunshiny day or a summer's evening, going through the
      last-named pantomimic feats with as much liquorish energy, and as total an
      absence of reserve, as if they were on the very stage itself? We can tell
      upon our fingers a dozen pantaloons of our acquaintance at this
      moment-capital pantaloons, who have been performing all kinds of strange
      freaks, to the great amusement of their friends and acquaintance, for
      years past; and who to this day are making such comical and ineffectual
      attempts to be young and dissolute, that all beholders are like to die
      with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take that old gentleman who has just emerged from the CafAC de l'Europe in
      the Haymarket, where he has been dining at the expense of the young man
      upon town with whom he shakes hands as they part at the door of the
      tavern. The affected warmth of that shake of the hand, the courteous nod,
      the obvious recollection of the dinner, the savoury flavour of which still
      hangs upon his lips, are all characteristics of his great prototype. He
      hobbles away humming an opera tune, and twirling his cane to and fro, with
      affected carelessness. Suddenly he stops-'tis at the milliner's window. He
      peeps through one of the large panes of glass; and, his view of the ladies
      within being obstructed by the India shawls, directs his attentions to the
      young girl with the band-box in her hand, who is gazing in at the window
      also. See! he draws beside her. He coughs; she turns away from him. He
      draws near her again; she disregards him. He gleefully chucks her under
      the chin, and, retreating a few steps, nods and beckons with fantastic
      grimaces, while the girl bestows a contemptuous and supercilious look upon
      his wrinkled visage. She turns away with a flounce, and the old gentleman
      trots after her with a toothless chuckle. The pantaloon to the life!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the close resemblance which the clowns of the stage bear to those of
      every-day life is perfectly extraordinary. Some people talk with a sigh of
      the decline of pantomime, and murmur in low and dismal tones the name of
      Grimaldi. We mean no disparagement to the worthy and excellent old man
      when we say that this is downright nonsense. Clowns that beat Grimaldi all
      to nothing turn up every day, and nobody patronizes them-more's the pity!
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know who you mean,' says some dirty-faced patron of Mr. Osbaldistone's,
      laying down the Miscellany when he has got thus far, and bestowing upon
      vacancy a most knowing glance; 'you mean C. J. Smith as did Guy Fawkes,
      and George Barnwell at the Garden.' The dirty-faced gentleman has hardly
      uttered the words, when he is interrupted by a young gentleman in no
      shirt-collar and a Petersham coat. 'No, no,' says the young gentleman; 'he
      means Brown, King, and Gibson, at the 'Delphi.' Now, with great deference
      both to the first-named gentleman with the dirty face, and the last-named
      gentleman in the non-existing shirt- collar, we do not mean either the
      performer who so grotesquely burlesqued the Popish conspirator, or the
      three unchangeables who have been dancing the same dance under different
      imposing titles, and doing the same thing under various high-sounding
      names for some five or six years last past. We have no sooner made this
      avowal, than the public, who have hitherto been silent witnesses of the
      dispute, inquire what on earth it is we do mean; and, with becoming
      respect, we proceed to tell them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very well known to all playgoers and pantomime-seers, that the
      scenes in which a theatrical clown is at the very height of his glory are
      those which are described in the play-bills as 'Cheesemonger's shop and
      Crockery warehouse,' or 'Tailor's shop, and Mrs. Queertable's
      boarding-house,' or places bearing some such title, where the great fun of
      the thing consists in the hero's taking lodgings which he has not the
      slightest intention of paying for, or obtaining goods under false
      pretences, or abstracting the stock-in-trade of the respectable shopkeeper
      next door, or robbing warehouse porters as they pass under his window, or,
      to shorten the catalogue, in his swindling everybody he possibly can, it
      only remaining to be observed that, the more extensive the swindling is,
      and the more barefaced the impudence of the swindler, the greater the
      rapture and ecstasy of the audience. Now it is a most remarkable fact that
      precisely this sort of thing occurs in real life day after day, and nobody
      sees the humour of it. Let us illustrate our position by detailing the
      plot of this portion of the pantomime-not of the theatre, but of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable Captain Fitz-Whisker Fiercy, attended by his livery servant
      Do'em-a most respectable servant to look at, who has grown grey in the
      service of the captain's family-views, treats for, and ultimately obtains
      possession of, the unfurnished house, such a number, such a street. All
      the tradesmen in the neighbourhood are in agonies of competition for the
      captain's custom; the captain is a good-natured, kind-hearted, easy man,
      and, to avoid being the cause of disappointment to any, he most handsomely
      gives orders to all. Hampers of wine, baskets of provisions, cart-loads of
      furniture, boxes of jewellery, supplies of luxuries of the costliest
      description, flock to the house of the Honourable Captain Fitz-Whisker
      Fiercy, where they are received with the utmost readiness by the highly
      respectable Do'em; while the captain himself struts and swaggers about
      with that compound air of conscious superiority and general
      blood-thirstiness which a military captain should always, and does most
      times, wear, to the admiration and terror of plebeian men. But the
      tradesmen's backs are no sooner turned, than the captain, with all the
      eccentricity of a mighty mind, and assisted by the faithful Do'em, whose
      devoted fidelity is not the least touching part of his character, disposes
      of everything to great advantage; for, although the articles fetch small
      sums, still they are sold considerably above cost price, the cost to the
      captain having been nothing at all. After various manoeuvres, the
      imposture is discovered, Fitz-Fiercy and Do'em are recognized as
      confederates, and the police office to which they are both taken is
      thronged with their dupes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can fail to recognize in this, the exact counterpart of the best
      portion of a theatrical pantomime-Fitz-Whisker Fiercy by the clown; Do'em
      by the pantaloon; and supernumeraries by the tradesmen? The best of the
      joke, too, is, that the very coal-merchant who is loudest in his
      complaints against the person who defrauded him, is the identical man who
      sat in the centre of the very front row of the pit last night and laughed
      the most boisterously at this very same thing,-and not so well done
      either. Talk of Grimaldi, we say again! Did Grimaldi, in his best days,
      ever do anything in this way equal to Da Costa?
    </p>
    <p>
      The mention of this latter justly celebrated clown reminds us of his last
      piece of humour, the fraudulently obtaining certain stamped acceptances
      from a young gentleman in the army. We had scarcely laid down our pen to
      contemplate for a few moments this admirable actor's performance of that
      exquisite practical joke, than a new branch of our subject flashed
      suddenly upon us. So we take it up again at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      All people who have been behind the scenes, and most people who have been
      before them, know, that in the representation of a pantomime, a good many
      men are sent upon the stage for the express purpose of being cheated, or
      knocked down, or both. Now, down to a moment ago, we had never been able
      to understand for what possible purpose a great number of odd, lazy,
      large-headed men, whom one is in the habit of meeting here, and there, and
      everywhere, could ever have been created. We see it all, now. They are the
      supernumeraries in the pantomime of life; the men who have been thrust
      into it, with no other view than to be constantly tumbling over each
      other, and running their heads against all sorts of strange things. We sat
      opposite to one of these men at a supper-table, only last week. Now we
      think of it, he was exactly like the gentlemen with the pasteboard heads
      and faces, who do the corresponding business in the theatrical pantomimes;
      there was the same broad stolid simper-the same dull leaden eye-the same
      unmeaning, vacant stare; and whatever was said, or whatever was done, he
      always came in at precisely the wrong place, or jostled against something
      that he had not the slightest business with. We looked at the man across
      the table again and again; and could not satisfy ourselves what race of
      beings to class him with. How very odd that this never occurred to us
      before!
    </p>
    <p>
      We will frankly own that we have been much troubled with the harlequin. We
      see harlequins of so many kinds in the real living pantomime, that we
      hardly know which to select as the proper fellow of him of the theatres.
      At one time we were disposed to think that the harlequin was neither more
      nor less than a young man of family and independent property, who had run
      away with an opera-dancer, and was fooling his life and his means away in
      light and trivial amusements. On reflection, however, we remembered that
      harlequins are occasionally guilty of witty, and even clever acts, and we
      are rather disposed to acquit our young men of family and independent
      property, generally speaking, of any such misdemeanours. On a more mature
      consideration of the subject, we have arrived at the conclusion that the
      harlequins of life are just ordinary men, to be found in no particular
      walk or degree, on whom a certain station, or particular conjunction of
      circumstances, confers the magic wand. And this brings us to a few words
      on the pantomime of public and political life, which we shall say at once,
      and then conclude-merely premising in this place that we decline any
      reference whatever to the columbine, being in no wise satisfied of the
      nature of her connection with her parti-coloured lover, and not feeling by
      any means clear that we should be justified in introducing her to the
      virtuous and respectable ladies who peruse our lucubrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take it that the commencement of a Session of Parliament is neither
      more nor less than the drawing up of the curtain for a grand comic
      pantomime, and that his Majesty's most gracious speech on the opening
      thereof may be not inaptly compared to the clown's opening speech of 'Here
      we are!' 'My lords and gentlemen, here we are!' appears, to our mind at
      least, to be a very good abstract of the point and meaning of the
      propitiatory address of the ministry. When we remember how frequently this
      speech is made, immediately after the change too, the parallel is quite
      perfect, and still more singular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the cast of our political pantomime never was richer than at this
      day. We are particularly strong in clowns. At no former time, we should
      say, have we had such astonishing tumblers, or performers so ready to go
      through the whole of their feats for the amusement of an admiring throng.
      Their extreme readiness to exhibit, indeed, has given rise to some
      ill-natured reflections; it having been objected that by exhibiting
      gratuitously through the country when the theatre is closed, they reduce
      themselves to the level of mountebanks, and thereby tend to degrade the
      respectability of the profession. Certainly Grimaldi never did this sort
      of thing; and though Brown, King, and Gibson have gone to the Surrey in
      vacation time, and Mr. C. J. Smith has ruralised at Sadler's Wells, we
      find no theatrical precedent for a general tumbling through the country,
      except in the gentleman, name unknown, who threw summersets on behalf of
      the late Mr. Richardson, and who is no authority either, because he had
      never been on the regular boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, laying aside this question, which after all is a mere matter of
      taste, we may reflect with pride and gratification of heart on the
      proficiency of our clowns as exhibited in the season. Night after night
      will they twist and tumble about, till two, three, and four o'clock in the
      morning; playing the strangest antics, and giving each other the funniest
      slaps on the face that can possibly be imagined, without evincing the
      smallest tokens of fatigue. The strange noises, the confusion, the
      shouting and roaring, amid which all this is done, too, would put to shame
      the most turbulent sixpenny gallery that ever yelled through a
      boxing-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is especially curious to behold one of these clowns compelled to go
      through the most surprising contortions by the irresistible influence of
      the wand of office, which his leader or harlequin holds above his head.
      Acted upon by this wonderful charm he will become perfectly motionless,
      moving neither hand, foot, nor finger, and will even lose the faculty of
      speech at an instant's notice; or on the other hand, he will become all
      life and animation if required, pouring forth a torrent of words without
      sense or meaning, throwing himself into the wildest and most fantastic
      contortions, and even grovelling on the earth and licking up the dust.
      These exhibitions are more curious than pleasing; indeed, they are rather
      disgusting than otherwise, except to the admirers of such things, with
      whom we confess we have no fellow-feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange tricks-very strange tricks-are also performed by the harlequin who
      holds for the time being the magic wand which we have just mentioned. The
      mere waving it before a man's eyes will dispossess his brains of all the
      notions previously stored there, and fill it with an entirely new set of
      ideas; one gentle tap on the back will alter the colour of a man's coat
      completely; and there are some expert performers, who, having this wand
      held first on one side and then on the other, will change from side to
      side, turning their coats at every evolution, with so much rapidity and
      dexterity, that the quickest eye can scarcely detect their motions.
      Occasionally, the genius who confers the wand, wrests it from the hand of
      the temporary possessor, and consigns it to some new performer; on which
      occasions all the characters change sides, and then the race and the hard
      knocks begin anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might have extended this chapter to a much greater length-we might have
      carried the comparison into the liberal professions-we might have shown,
      as was in fact our original purpose, that each is in itself a little
      pantomime with scenes and characters of its own, complete; but, as we fear
      we have been quite lengthy enough already, we shall leave this chapter
      just where it is. A gentleman, not altogether unknown as a dramatic poet,
      wrote thus a year or two ago-
    </p>
    <p>
      'All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players:'
    </p>
    <p>
      and we, tracking out his footsteps at the scarcely-worth-mentioning little
      distance of a few millions of leagues behind, venture to add, by way of
      new reading, that he meant a Pantomime, and that we are all actors in The
      Pantomime of Life. SOME PARTICULARS CONCERNING A LION
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a great respect for lions in the abstract. In common with most
      other people, we have heard and read of many instances of their bravery
      and generosity. We have duly admired that heroic self-denial and charming
      philanthropy which prompts them never to eat people except when they are
      hungry, and we have been deeply impressed with a becoming sense of the
      politeness they are said to display towards unmarried ladies of a certain
      state. All natural histories teem with anecdotes illustrative of their
      excellent qualities; and one old spelling-book in particular recounts a
      touching instance of an old lion, of high moral dignity and stern
      principle, who felt it his imperative duty to devour a young man who had
      contracted a habit of swearing, as a striking example to the rising
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is extremely pleasant to reflect upon, and, indeed, says a very
      great deal in favour of lions as a mass. We are bound to state, however,
      that such individual lions as we have happened to fall in with have not
      put forth any very striking characteristics, and have not acted up to the
      chivalrous character assigned them by their chroniclers. We never saw a
      lion in what is called his natural state, certainly; that is to say, we
      have never met a lion out walking in a forest, or crouching in his lair
      under a tropical sun, waiting till his dinner should happen to come by,
      hot from the baker's. But we have seen some under the influence of
      captivity, and the pressure of misfortune; and we must say that they
      appeared to us very apathetic, heavy-headed fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lion at the Zoological Gardens, for instance. He is all very well; he
      has an undeniable mane, and looks very fierce; but, Lord bless us! what of
      that? The lions of the fashionable world look just as ferocious, and are
      the most harmless creatures breathing. A box-lobby lion or a Regent-street
      animal will put on a most terrible aspect, and roar, fearfully, if you
      affront him; but he will never bite, and, if you offer to attack him
      manfully, will fairly turn tail and sneak off. Doubtless these creatures
      roam about sometimes in herds, and, if they meet any especially
      meek-looking and peaceably-disposed fellow, will endeavour to frighten
      him; but the faintest show of a vigorous resistance is sufficient to scare
      them even then. These are pleasant characteristics, whereas we make it
      matter of distinct charge against the Zoological lion and his brethren at
      the fairs, that they are sleepy, dreamy, sluggish quadrupeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not remember to have ever seen one of them perfectly awake, except
      at feeding-time. In every respect we uphold the biped lions against their
      four-footed namesakes, and we boldly challenge controversy upon the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these opinions it may be easily imagined that our curiosity and
      interest were very much excited the other day, when a lady of our
      acquaintance called on us and resolutely declined to accept our refusal of
      her invitation to an evening party; 'for,' said she, 'I have got a lion
      coming.' We at once retracted our plea of a prior engagement, and became
      as anxious to go, as we had previously been to stay away.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went early, and posted ourselves in an eligible part of the drawing-
      room, from whence we could hope to obtain a full view of the interesting
      animal. Two or three hours passed, the quadrilles began, the room filled;
      but no lion appeared. The lady of the house became inconsolable,-for it is
      one of the peculiar privileges of these lions to make solemn appointments
      and never keep them,-when all of a sudden there came a tremendous double
      rap at the street-door, and the master of the house, after gliding out
      (unobserved as he flattered himself) to peep over the banisters, came into
      the room, rubbing his hands together with great glee, and cried out in a
      very important voice, 'My dear, Mr.-(naming the lion) has this moment
      arrived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, all eyes were turned towards the door, and we observed several
      young ladies, who had been laughing and conversing previously with great
      gaiety and good humour, grow extremely quiet and sentimental; while some
      young gentlemen, who had been cutting great figures in the facetious and
      small-talk way, suddenly sank very obviously in the estimation of the
      company, and were looked upon with great coldness and indifference. Even
      the young man who had been ordered from the music shop to play the
      pianoforte was visibly affected, and struck several false notes in the
      excess of his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time there was a great talking outside, more than once
      accompanied by a loud laugh, and a cry of 'Oh! capital! excellent!' from
      which we inferred that the lion was jocose, and that these exclamations
      were occasioned by the transports of his keeper and our host. Nor were we
      deceived; for when the lion at last appeared, we overheard his keeper, who
      was a little prim man, whisper to several gentlemen of his acquaintance,
      with uplifted hands, and every expression of half- suppressed admiration,
      that-(naming the lion again) was in such cue to- night!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lion was a literary one. Of course, there were a vast number of people
      present who had admired his roarings, and were anxious to be introduced to
      him; and very pleasant it was to see them brought up for the purpose, and
      to observe the patient dignity with which he received all their patting
      and caressing. This brought forcibly to our mind what we had so often
      witnessed at country fairs, where the other lions are compelled to go
      through as many forms of courtesy as they chance to be acquainted with,
      just as often as admiring parties happen to drop in upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the lion was exhibiting in this way, his keeper was not idle, for he
      mingled among the crowd, and spread his praises most industriously. To one
      gentleman he whispered some very choice thing that the noble animal had
      said in the very act of coming up-stairs, which, of course, rendered the
      mental effort still more astonishing; to another he murmured a hasty
      account of a grand dinner that had taken place the day before, where
      twenty-seven gentlemen had got up all at once to demand an extra cheer for
      the lion; and to the ladies he made sundry promises of interceding to
      procure the majestic brute's sign-manual for their albums. Then, there
      were little private consultations in different corners, relative to the
      personal appearance and stature of the lion; whether he was shorter than
      they had expected to see him, or taller, or thinner, or fatter, or
      younger, or older; whether he was like his portrait, or unlike it; and
      whether the particular shade of his eyes was black, or blue, or hazel, or
      green, or yellow, or mixture. At all these consultations the keeper
      assisted; and, in short, the lion was the sole and single subject of
      discussion till they sat him down to whist, and then the people relapsed
      into their old topics of conversation-themselves and each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must confess that we looked forward with no slight impatience to the
      announcement of supper; for if you wish to see a tame lion under
      particularly favourable circumstances, feeding-time is the period of all
      others to pitch upon. We were therefore very much delighted to observe a
      sensation among the guests, which we well knew how to interpret, and
      immediately afterwards to behold the lion escorting the lady of the house
      down-stairs. We offered our arm to an elderly female of our acquaintance,
      who-dear old soul!-is the very best person that ever lived, to lead down
      to any meal; for, be the room ever so small, or the party ever so large,
      she is sure, by some intuitive perception of the eligible, to push and
      pull herself and conductor close to the best dishes on the table;-we say
      we offered our arm to this elderly female, and, descending the stairs
      shortly after the lion, were fortunate enough to obtain a seat nearly
      opposite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the keeper was there already. He had planted himself at
      precisely that distance from his charge which afforded him a decent
      pretext for raising his voice, when he addressed him, to so loud a key, as
      could not fail to attract the attention of the whole company, and
      immediately began to apply himself seriously to the task of bringing the
      lion out, and putting him through the whole of his manoeuvres. Such
      flashes of wit as he elicited from the lion! First of all, they began to
      make puns upon a salt-cellar, and then upon the breast of a fowl, and then
      upon the trifle; but the best jokes of all were decidedly on the lobster
      salad, upon which latter subject the lion came out most vigorously, and,
      in the opinion of the most competent authorities, quite outshone himself.
      This is a very excellent mode of shining in society, and is founded, we
      humbly conceive, upon the classic model of the dialogues between Mr. Punch
      and his friend the proprietor, wherein the latter takes all the up-hill
      work, and is content to pioneer to the jokes and repartees of Mr. P.
      himself, who never fails to gain great credit and excite much laughter
      thereby. Whatever it be founded on, however, we recommend it to all lions,
      present and to come; for in this instance it succeeded to admiration, and
      perfectly dazzled the whole body of hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the salt-cellar, and the fowl's breast, and the trifle, and the
      lobster salad were all exhausted, and could not afford standing-room for
      another solitary witticism, the keeper performed that very dangerous feat
      which is still done with some of the caravan lions, although in one
      instance it terminated fatally, of putting his head in the animal's mouth,
      and placing himself entirely at its mercy. Boswell frequently presents a
      melancholy instance of the lamentable results of this achievement, and
      other keepers and jackals have been terribly lacerated for their daring.
      It is due to our lion to state, that he condescended to be trifled with,
      in the most gentle manner, and finally went home with the showman in a
      hack cab: perfectly peaceable, but slightly fuddled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in a contemplative mood, we were led to make some reflections upon
      the character and conduct of this genus of lions as we walked homewards,
      and we were not long in arriving at the conclusion that our former
      impression in their favour was very much strengthened and confirmed by
      what we had recently seen. While the other lions receive company and
      compliments in a sullen, moody, not to say snarling manner, these appear
      flattered by the attentions that are paid them; while those conceal
      themselves to the utmost of their power from the vulgar gaze, these court
      the popular eye, and, unlike their brethren, whom nothing short of
      compulsion will move to exertion, are ever ready to display their
      acquirements to the wondering throng. We have known bears of undoubted
      ability who, when the expectations of a large audience have been wound up
      to the utmost pitch, have peremptorily refused to dance; well-taught
      monkeys, who have unaccountably objected to exhibit on the slack wire; and
      elephants of unquestioned genius, who have suddenly declined to turn the
      barrel-organ; but we never once knew or heard of a biped lion, literary or
      otherwise,-and we state it as a fact which is highly creditable to the
      whole species,-who, occasion offering, did not seize with avidity on any
      opportunity which was afforded him, of performing to his heart's content
      on the first violin. MR. ROBERT BOLTON: THE 'GENTLEMAN CONNECTED WITH THE
      PRESS'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the parlour of the Green Dragon, a public-house in the immediate
      neighbourhood of Westminster Bridge, everybody talks politics, every
      evening, the great political authority being Mr. Robert Bolton, an
      individual who defines himself as 'a gentleman connected with the press,'
      which is a definition of peculiar indefiniteness. Mr. Robert Bolton's
      regular circle of admirers and listeners are an undertaker, a greengrocer,
      a hairdresser, a baker, a large stomach surmounted by a man's head, and
      placed on the top of two particularly short legs, and a thin man in black,
      name, profession, and pursuit unknown, who always sits in the same
      position, always displays the same long, vacant face, and never opens his
      lips, surrounded as he is by most enthusiastic conversation, except to
      puff forth a volume of tobacco smoke, or give vent to a very snappy, loud,
      and shrill hem! The conversation sometimes turns upon literature, Mr.
      Bolton being a literary character, and always upon such news of the day as
      is exclusively possessed by that talented individual. I found myself (of
      course, accidentally) in the Green Dragon the other evening, and, being
      somewhat amused by the following conversation, preserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you lend me a ten-pound note till Christmas?' inquired the
      hairdresser of the stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where's your security, Mr. Clip?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My stock in trade,-there's enough of it, I'm thinking, Mr. Thicknesse.
      Some fifty wigs, two poles, half-a-dozen head blocks, and a dead Bruin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I won't, then,' growled out Thicknesse. 'I lends nothing on the
      security of the whigs or the Poles either. As for whigs, they're cheats;
      as for the Poles, they've got no cash. I never have nothing to do with
      blockheads, unless I can't awoid it (ironically), and a dead bear's about
      as much use to me as I could be to a dead bear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then,' urged the other, 'there's a book as belonged to Pope,
      Byron's Poems, valued at forty pounds, because it's got Pope's identical
      scratch on the back; what do you think of that for security?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, to be sure!' cried the baker. 'But how d'ye mean, Mr. Clip?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mean! why, that it's got the hottergruff of Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Steal not this book, for fear of hangman's rope; For it belongs to
      Alexander Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      All that's written on the inside of the binding of the book; so, as my son
      says, we're bound to believe it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sir,' observed the undertaker, deferentially, and in a half-
      whisper, leaning over the table, and knocking over the hairdresser's grog
      as he spoke, 'that argument's very easy upset.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps, sir,' said Clip, a little flurried, 'you'll pay for the first
      upset afore you thinks of another.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' said the undertaker, bowing amicably to the hairdresser, 'I think,
      I says I think-you'll excuse me, Mr. Clip, I think, you see, that won't go
      down with the present company-unfortunately, my master had the honour of
      making the coffin of that ere Lord's housemaid, not no more nor twenty
      year ago. Don't think I'm proud on it, gentlemen; others might be; but I
      hate rank of any sort. I've no more respect for a Lord's footman than I
      have for any respectable tradesman in this room. I may say no more nor I
      have for Mr. Clip! (bowing). Therefore, that ere Lord must have been born
      long after Pope died. And it's a logical interference to defer, that they
      neither of them lived at the same time. So what I mean is this here, that
      Pope never had no book, never seed, felt, never smelt no book
      (triumphantly) as belonged to that ere Lord. And, gentlemen, when I
      consider how patiently you have 'eared the ideas what I have expressed, I
      feel bound, as the best way to reward you for the kindness you have
      exhibited, to sit down without saying anything more-partickler as I
      perceive a worthier visitor nor myself is just entered. I am not in the
      habit of paying compliments, gentlemen; when I do, therefore, I hope I
      strikes with double force.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Mr. Murgatroyd! what's all this about striking with double force?'
      said the object of the above remark, as he entered. 'I never excuse a
      man's getting into a rage during winter, even when he's seated so close to
      the fire as you are. It is very injudicious to put yourself into such a
      perspiration. What is the cause of this extreme physical and mental
      excitement, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the very philosophical address of Mr. Robert Bolton, a
      shorthand-writer, as he termed himself-a bit of equivoque passing current
      among his fraternity, which must give the uninitiated a vast idea of the
      establishment of the ministerial organ, while to the initiated it
      signifies that no one paper can lay claim to the enjoyment of their
      services. Mr. Bolton was a young man, with a somewhat sickly and very
      dissipated expression of countenance. His habiliments were composed of an
      exquisite union of gentility, slovenliness, assumption, simplicity,
      newness, and old age. Half of him was dressed for the winter, the other
      half for the summer. His hat was of the newest cut, the D'Orsay; his
      trousers had been white, but the inroads of mud and ink, etc., had given
      them a pie-bald appearance; round his throat he wore a very high black
      cravat, of the most tyrannical stiffness; while his tout ensemble was
      hidden beneath the enormous folds of an old brown poodle-collared
      great-coat, which was closely buttoned up to the aforesaid cravat. His
      fingers peeped through the ends of his black kid gloves, and two of the
      toes of each foot took a similar view of society through the extremities
      of his high-lows. Sacred to the bare walls of his garret be the mysteries
      of his interior dress! He was a short, spare man, of a somewhat inferior
      deportment. Everybody seemed influenced by his entry into the room, and
      his salutation of each member partook of the patronizing. The hairdresser
      made way for him between himself and the stomach. A minute afterwards he
      had taken possession of his pint and pipe. A pause in the conversation
      took place. Everybody was waiting, anxious for his first observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Horrid murder in Westminster this morning,' observed Mr. Bolton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody changed their positions. All eyes were fixed upon the man of
      paragraphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A baker murdered his son by boiling him in a copper,' said Mr. Bolton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens!' exclaimed everybody, in simultaneous horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Boiled him, gentlemen!' added Mr. Bolton, with the most effective
      emphasis; 'boiled him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the particulars, Mr. B.,' inquired the hairdresser, 'the
      particulars?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolton took a very long draught of porter, and some two or three dozen
      whiffs of tobacco, doubtless to instil into the commercial capacities of
      the company the superiority of a gentlemen connected with the press, and
      then said-
    </p>
    <p>
      'The man was a baker, gentlemen.' (Every one looked at the baker present,
      who stared at Bolton.) 'His victim, being his son, also was necessarily
      the son of a baker. The wretched murderer had a wife, whom he was
      frequently in the habit, while in an intoxicated state, of kicking,
      pummelling, flinging mugs at, knocking down, and half-killing while in
      bed, by inserting in her mouth a considerable portion of a sheet or
      blanket.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker took another draught, everybody looked at everybody else, and
      exclaimed, 'Horrid!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It appears in evidence, gentlemen,' continued Mr. Bolton, 'that, on the
      evening of yesterday, Sawyer the baker came home in a reprehensible state
      of beer. Mrs. S., connubially considerate, carried him in that condition
      up-stairs into his chamber, and consigned him to their mutual couch. In a
      minute or two she lay sleeping beside the man whom the morrow's dawn
      beheld a murderer!' (Entire silence informed the reporter that his picture
      had attained the awful effect he desired.) 'The son came home about an
      hour afterwards, opened the door, and went up to bed. Scarcely (gentlemen,
      conceive his feelings of alarm), scarcely had he taken off his
      indescribables, when shrieks (to his experienced ear maternal shrieks)
      scared the silence of surrounding night. He put his indescribables on
      again, and ran down-stairs. He opened the door of the parental
      bed-chamber. His father was dancing upon his mother. What must have been
      his feelings! In the agony of the minute he rushed at his male parent as
      he was about to plunge a knife into the side of his female. The mother
      shrieked. The father caught the son (who had wrested the knife from the
      paternal grasp) up in his arms, carried him down-stairs, shoved him into a
      copper of boiling water among some linen, closed the lid, and jumped upon
      the top of it, in which position he was found with a ferocious countenance
      by the mother, who arrived in the melancholy wash-house just as he had so
      settled himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Where's my boy?" shrieked the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"In that copper, boiling," coolly replied the benign father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Struck by the awful intelligence, the mother rushed from the house, and
      alarmed the neighbourhood. The police entered a minute afterwards. The
      father, having bolted the wash-house door, had bolted himself. They
      dragged the lifeless body of the boiled baker from the cauldron, and, with
      a promptitude commendable in men of their station, they immediately
      carried it to the station-house. Subsequently, the baker was apprehended
      while seated on the top of a lamp-post in Parliament Street, lighting his
      pipe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole horrible ideality of the Mysteries of Udolpho, condensed into
      the pithy effect of a ten-line paragraph, could not possibly have so
      affected the narrator's auditory. Silence, the purest and most noble of
      all kinds of applause, bore ample testimony to the barbarity of the baker,
      as well as to Bolton's knack of narration; and it was only broken after
      some minutes had elapsed by interjectional expressions of the intense
      indignation of every man present. The baker wondered how a British baker
      could so disgrace himself and the highly honourable calling to which he
      belonged; and the others indulged in a variety of wonderments connected
      with the subject; among which not the least wonderment was that which was
      awakened by the genius and information of Mr. Robert Bolton, who, after a
      glowing eulogium on himself, and his unspeakable influence with the daily
      press, was proceeding, with a most solemn countenance, to hear the pros
      and cons of the Pope autograph question, when I took up my hat, and left.
      FAMILIAR EPISTLE FROM A PARENT TO A CHILD aged two years and two months
    </p>
    <p>
      My Child,
    </p>
    <p>
      To recount with what trouble I have brought you up-with what an anxious
      eye I have regarded your progress,-how late and how often I have sat up at
      night working for you,-and how many thousand letters I have received from,
      and written to your various relations and friends, many of whom have been
      of a querulous and irritable turn,-to dwell on the anxiety and tenderness
      with which I have (as far as I possessed the power) inspected and chosen
      your food; rejecting the indigestible and heavy matter which some
      injudicious but well-meaning old ladies would have had you swallow, and
      retaining only those light and pleasant articles which I deemed calculated
      to keep you free from all gross humours, and to render you an agreeable
      child, and one who might be popular with society in general,-to dilate on
      the steadiness with which I have prevented your annoying any company by
      talking politics-always assuring you that you would thank me for it
      yourself some day when you grew older,-to expatiate, in short, upon my own
      assiduity as a parent, is beside my present purpose, though I cannot but
      contemplate your fair appearance-your robust health, and unimpeded
      circulation (which I take to be the great secret of your good looks)
      without the liveliest satisfaction and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a trite observation, and one which, young as you are, I have no
      doubt you have often heard repeated, that we have fallen upon strange
      times, and live in days of constant shiftings and changes. I had a
      melancholy instance of this only a week or two since. I was returning from
      Manchester to London by the Mail Train, when I suddenly fell into another
      train-a mixed train-of reflection, occasioned by the dejected and
      disconsolate demeanour of the Post-Office Guard. We were stopping at some
      station where they take in water, when he dismounted slowly from the
      little box in which he sits in ghastly mockery of his old condition with
      pistol and blunderbuss beside him, ready to shoot the first highwayman (or
      railwayman) who shall attempt to stop the horses, which now travel (when
      they travel at all) inside and in a portable stable invented for the
      purpose,-he dismounted, I say, slowly and sadly, from his post, and
      looking mournfully about him as if in dismal recollection of the old
      roadside public-house the blazing fire-the glass of foaming ale-the buxom
      handmaid and admiring hangers-on of tap-room and stable, all honoured by
      his notice; and, retiring a little apart, stood leaning against a
      signal-post, surveying the engine with a look of combined affliction and
      disgust which no words can describe. His scarlet coat and golden lace were
      tarnished with ignoble smoke; flakes of soot had fallen on his bright
      green shawl-his pride in days of yore-the steam condensed in the tunnel
      from which we had just emerged, shone upon his hat like rain. His eye
      betokened that he was thinking of the coachman; and as it wandered to his
      own seat and his own fast-fading garb, it was plain to see that he felt
      his office and himself had alike no business there, and were nothing but
      an elaborate practical joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we whirled away, I was led insensibly into an anticipation of those
      days to come, when mail-coach guards shall no longer be judges of horse-
      flesh-when a mail-coach guard shall never even have seen a horse-when
      stations shall have superseded stables, and corn shall have given place to
      coke. 'In those dawning times,' thought I, 'exhibition-rooms shall teem
      with portraits of Her Majesty's favourite engine, with boilers after
      Nature by future Landseers. Some Amburgh, yet unborn, shall break wild
      horses by his magic power; and in the dress of a mail-coach guard exhibit
      his trained animals in a mock mail-coach. Then, shall wondering crowds
      observe how that, with the exception of his whip, it is all his eye; and
      crowned heads shall see them fed on oats, and stand alone unmoved and
      undismayed, while counters flee affrighted when the coursers neigh!'

      Such, my child, were the reflections from which I was only awakened then,
      as I am now, by the necessity of attending to matters of present though
      minor importance. I offer no apology to you for the digression, for it
      brings me very naturally to the subject of change, which is the very
      subject of which I desire to treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, my child, you have changed hands. Henceforth I resign you to the
      guardianship and protection of one of my most intimate and valued friends,
      Mr. Ainsworth, with whom, and with you, my best wishes and warmest
      feelings will ever remain. I reap no gain or profit by parting from you,
      nor will any conveyance of your property be required, for, in this
      respect, you have always been literally 'Bentley's' Miscellany, and never
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the driver of the old Manchester mail, I regard this altered state
      of things with feelings of unmingled pleasure and satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the guard of the new Manchester mail, your guard is at home in his
      new place, and has roystering highwaymen and gallant desperadoes ever
      within call. And if I might compare you, my child, to an engine; (not a
      Tory engine, nor a Whig engine, but a brisk and rapid locomotive;) your
      friends and patrons to passengers; and he who now stands towards you in
      loco parentis as the skilful engineer and supervisor of the whole, I would
      humbly crave leave to postpone the departure of the train on its new and
      auspicious course for one brief instant, while, with hat in hand, I
      approach side by side with the friend who travelled with me on the old
      road, and presume to solicit favour and kindness in behalf of him and his
      new charge, both for their sakes and that of the old coachman,
    </p>
    <p>
      Boz.
